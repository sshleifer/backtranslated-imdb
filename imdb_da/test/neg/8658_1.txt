It is certainly not worth spending money or time. It is the same chopped plot of a guy and a girl who meet and fall in love. But this is with a Western touch. But it does not fail either to depict a love story or to give it the western touch. We never feel that hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth to any of their characters. Probably, with a better cast there could have been little justice on the characters. Finally, it is a movie with no fun, no action, no theme, no plot, no comedy, no action, no excitement, no romance (I associate romance with something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would like with your family. Overall, if you're looking for a movie with some content, it's definitely not an option. I have to wait for the day when Bollywood movies are something I can wait to see and I can refer to my friends as a "must see" movie.
