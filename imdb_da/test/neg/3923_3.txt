It is said that there are some people out there who actually ADMIRE Monograms movies. Well - and why not? Monogram Studios lived on a sort of Cost Plus basis; costs, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every time. Sure they are cheap. But let's look it out: they are coarse, fast, philistine, vulgar, but exciting. They have no pretensions at all. They are designed to distract the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill. So what if John Wayne gallops through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles? This is not art, it's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie, "Fly to Mars". In the beginning, when we first meet the characters, a man can suddenly introduce his female companion and avoid any boring ease: "Professor, this is my fiance and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. She loves me but grows impatiently with me Because I am always wrapped up in my scientific work, maybe you can steal her from me, marry her, give her the babies and the hired home she longs for, if necessary I will die on this journey to see her dreams realized She also likes it a little roughly. "It saves a lot of writing and shooting time, doesn't it? That's what people think when they say a story is "fast". (This one was shot in five days.) Why should we hint about these things? I mean, what the hell is this, a cheap sci movie or Henry James? In fact, this is a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram movie. It's in color, for one thing. "Cinecolor" to be precise. (You can tell that there is no other "color" you want to recognize.) And look at the cast. The female lead is repulsive as is normal with Monogram, but the male lead is clearly on the B list. Cameron Mitchell as a reporter, but still striking his step as a male leader who comes to mind, he never did. And Arthur Franz as a search engine researcher, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And - for science fiction fans - what about this pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There is not much point in describing the plot in detail. The five crew members collide on Mars, where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose development was isomorphic with ours, right down to their having five digits and will babes in short skirts. And they downloaded English from listening to our broadcasts. American broadcasts, ie judging by their speech. They are led by an eerie solitaire who tries to hijack the spaceship, build many imitations of it and colonize the earth. They do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not very special. The men go around a couple of extra sets, wearing black costumes with stylized flashes that are emblazoned on their coffins and scarlet capes that are behind them. Their names consist entirely of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The happy Martian, who falls to Arthur Franz, is called Alita, with an indo-European little appendage, and she already knows what kisses. Overall, I found it so snappy as it was supposed to be, but also boring. The story is that of any Buck Rogers 1930s series. When the earthlings and martyrs meet, and it is established that they have a common language, and that the Martians have a grim agenda, then it is. In two hours, even an indifferent writer could make this a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is finished with the numbers, the dialogue has no mica, the actor is pedestrian. But dedicated aficionados of Monogram productions should enjoy it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the contrarian French egghead, dedicated "A Bout de Souffl√©" to Monogram, so they may not have been so bad.
