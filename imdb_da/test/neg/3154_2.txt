OK when I was a kid (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) Barney was one of my favorite shows. I then grew out of it and threw away all my old Barney bands. So one day, when I flip through channels, I see that Barney is now in a caboose and I thought "Um huh is this the right show?" When I realized it was, I freaked out. Why did they change the show's attitude from a school to a CABOOSE? Since then, the show has been terribly horrible, and the only reason I give it a 2 is a) because I'm nice, b) because of Riff, and c) because in ancient times the notion was acceptable. Now I just hate it. HATE IT. <br /> <br /> 2/10
