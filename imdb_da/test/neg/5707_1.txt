The protagonist is a whiny, irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a shame. She loses it by a drop, acts pathetically, is schizophrenic and lets me wonder why on earth she does not understand why these "friends" of her have not called her in three years. (Get a clue, sister - you're a juvenile mess!) I couldn't stand her or the friends. I have never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the whole movie even more unbearable, some went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats present on film for all eternity (this alone must guarantee that someone is put on wardrobe for a decade! ) <br /> <br /> The action was not terrible, but not credible, and ultimately the only thing I was worried about was the two hours I will never return. Don't waste your time - get started with a dentist contract instead!
