I don't mind any humorous humor, but this function was just plain dirty. The first 10 minutes consisted of Pryor swears by a guy who took pictures, followed my even more profanities. I do not know what happened between the time of the last 5 minutes because I went out. After seeing this, I never looked at Richard Pryor the same way again. And to think he actually hosted a children's show. <br /> <br /> If profanity and tasteless, eerie dirty jokes make you laugh, you'll probably enjoy it. But if you are an "old-fashioned" type, then you won't bother.
