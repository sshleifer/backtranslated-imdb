I saw this at Sundance and I can't figure out why it won the director's award. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. It is the type of movie that is only appreciated by movie party bosses who believe that any movie that many people like should be under them. The jury at Sundance this year seemed to make a conscious effort to reward the underdog, ultra-low-budget movie. It's all good and good, but this wandering, pulling rod looks like a home video. Mini-DV shots in a snowy gray winter result in a killing look for a killing movie. <br /> <br /> Certain motifs (snakes) are killed in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all bad now. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She wants to go places and she deserves it. Hugh co-star Hugh Dillon also does a good job. Frankly, there are many nice moments in this movie, but they just don't fit well together.
