No word can describe how horrible this movie is. Its like the director literally took as *** in a movie reel and sent it out to the audience. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is horrible, the plot is so stupid, and the deaths of each character are ridiculously bad. Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar, who pulls a gun out of nothing to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), Akshay Kumar carries a bazooka around the city, Rajat Bedi is struck by a poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double penetrating Monisha Korella (How did they think it was?). I would also like to point out that the animations are absolutely horrible. The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has a motorcycle and somehow wins the glasses. The shopping job looks like it was made in microsoft paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he even makes God feel scared. In a scene, he literally breaks a prison door by kicking it. Chuck Norris' round house has nothing on it! He is even so strong that he can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! Overall, this movie is perhaps the worst made movie in the universe. If you should see it, watch it for the hilarity that goes all the way through (BTW this movie should be serious)
