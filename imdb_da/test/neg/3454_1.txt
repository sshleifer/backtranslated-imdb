After seeing the first scene, I realized that the play was so bad that it couldn't pick up later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology like a five-year-old trying to make it sound like he knows what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> The second to the second story is completely unrealistic, and almost every decision writer did was the kind you expect from a middle-class school student. The overall story was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogues sound intelligent were limited to neurotic excuse. A ten year old liked it. But it would take a five year to accept the lack of realism; How does advanced cell function allow anyone to bypass a code lock by touching it as with a magic wand, choosing one of the 100s of voices through a ventilation system (thereby tearing off Superman) and repairing a home computer by just registering whats wrong in instead of looking for errors? In fact, that scene is a good example: The error was that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum strips) on the CPU was damaged, as it would look if an exhaust pipe on a V8 engine were ripped off by an explosion. This cannot happen, and if it did, it would not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric current passing through this band, but when he (without doing it himself, worked his arms at autopilot because the cells in his body were super-efficient) put a push pin in rip, a desk with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting. <br /> <br /> And then it goes all the way. Like when he fled an interrogation in the NSA headquarters by turning on a lighter under a fire sensor, resulting in open doors throughout the building. Of course, the NSA did not predict this sharp, witted approach to escape, nor did they place guards outside its room (or elsewhere) to maintain a living breakthrough in military nanotechnology. Then he went out and got a cab. Examples like this are not only numerous, there is actually only one single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> The so-called big effects were also terrible. He threw a basketball back to a child in the park and the child was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, as a motorized wagon. I'm sure if I stopped and looked for the cables that kept the team on this kid that only cables can, they probably didn't know how they could or would bother to delete them completely. If someone was thrown so far into a tree, they would at least say (or rather be inlaid with broken bones), but the child was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> Moronic. It is the word for any creative decision made throughout production. I want to put the instructor's name on my own personal blacklist, one who is poorly skilled as he cannot improve. I want to claim compensation for having wasted 45 minutes in my life to see it and the time it took to write this. Although it felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved. The only excuse, a little intelligent person, might have to see this voluntarily, would be imprisonment or lobotomy.
