A few clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of Doctor GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), where he touched his collaborative efforts with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson collided the "gore effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and a couple of other Lewis films in the late 60s. Lewis notes that while 2,000 MANIACS was a "five gallon" movie (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the Lewis-Patterson productions were "fifteen gallons" images. Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen gallon" movie - he only talks about the films he and Patterson made together. Lewis has confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to Doctor GORE was improvised before he even saw Patterson's movie! So take it with a grain of salt. <br /> <br /> This may be an "unfinished" movie, but like some unfinished novels, it has an "ending". It just lacks some connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a particular phase presence and a dry sense of humor that help make this simplistic show something more visible than it should be. There is an extremely barren plot - even BLOOD FEAST is more complex - and a gigantic repetitive musical score by William Girdler. A little nudity and lots of skin. The whole middle part of the movie involves the construction of a "perfect woman" this is concentrated doing for bloodthirsty and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Patterson's director is heading over his head, but he tries hard to tell his story creatively if it's possible to use Frankenstein clich√©s creatively. But the best reason to watch this movie (if possible) on something is that it has a perfect Nashville Weeper, Bill Hicks' "A Heart Dies Every Minute." Isn't that the truth!
