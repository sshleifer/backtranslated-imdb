I saw the first episode, and I found it a lot of wood performance. <br /> <br /> I've seen the original from the early days at Big Girls Blouse for the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim were a great documentary, and it is humor that most people get. <br /> <br /> But in this American version I found it to be boring, Molly Shannon is fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugs clothes is not as good as what the original Kimmy was wearing. I also found that Selma seemed to breathe out her stomach very much, she is of course an (Australian) size 12 where Kim should be (Australian) a size 16/18. <br /> <br /> The exchanges from Molly and Selma are, of course, the script, and there are breaks where there should be no breaks or the breaks are a bit long, as someone suggested there could be a slamming track in those breaks. It's like Molly and Shannon are not used to each other, there is no mother / daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Phil was okay, he had the eccentric air around him like Kel. But Craig was beautiful and not the sweet pure humble Brett from the Aussie version. <br /> <br /> I found that this was like seeing a very bad stage game. The play was pretty much wood and the exaggeration of Selma's expression was fun after ten minutes. Especially her sulking scenes. In summary, I find this show to be a waste of time, the script is obviously dumbed down for Americans, who mostly say they prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why not pay the producers the money to cut the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda, you are a smart cookie not to let the producers use your character by Sharon.
