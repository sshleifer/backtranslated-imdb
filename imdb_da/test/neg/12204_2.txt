Has anyone found the plot somewhere in the movie? Perhaps this pretentious lack of cinema lacks cinema. It is quite surprising that Gordon says "A movie without a plot is nothing" ... It is possible that characters have more to say that their own Wim Wenders. Was this sentence in the original plot, or the actor decided to send a tip to the director?
