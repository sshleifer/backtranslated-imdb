This documentary was neither professionally nor objectively made. It all played out as a conspiracy theory by IBM to win that match just to make some money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was breathed out before the fight, and when he lost, he didn't like it. I remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too hard to win. As time went by, I began to lose weight and did not like it. Today I simply do not play computers anymore because they are just too good. Not only that, the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to disturb and open the game for exciting opportunities. This documentary continues to show us pictures of The Turk, an old chess machine that was truly controlled by a human. From the beginning to the end, we believe that IBM is not able to hide a human GM literally on the back of their cabinet computer. I'm a computer scientist and insulting at the idea that just because Garry lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. It's not magical, and it's no mystery. They can be trained, have large amounts of cheating, and they certainly see positions and opportunities in unprecedented detail in relation to humans. It is really no surprise that Deep Blue won. Maybe it was at that time. If this happened today, given the ever-increasing machining effect of machines; people would hardly blink. If a machine could not at least draw with a GM today, people would think the program was weak.
