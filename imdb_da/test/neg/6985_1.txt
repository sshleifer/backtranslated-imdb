First of all, the original concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a New Zealand lake, inside a downward 2nd World War Plan, is a great opening. The following is nothing but a comic book as a drive. Men are chasing men, cars chasing men, helicopters chasing men, helicopters hunting boats, both hunting boats, in the better part of an hour, the most boring nonsense, with absolutely no progress to the story. Special attention must be paid to chop shop editing, as many scenes appear to have been split together in random order. The action of all concerned is an embarrassment. Finally, the picture quality and sound quality are so poor on this DVD that you will be horrified. - NOTE
