I thought I should see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie trying to get the audience (me) to make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk getting to Hell. The whole UFO case was a big red herring !!! The action in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, some people from an Evangelical Church seemed to be together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in church and talked to other church members. It was not really life dialogue at all. I wish I had read some reviews before I watched this movie so I would not have wasted my money on it. On the other hand, if you are in the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how limiting) it is on other people then you should see it all the time.
