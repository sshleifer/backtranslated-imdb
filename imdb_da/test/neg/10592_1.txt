Mod Squad is not a movie, it's a vacuum. It's the most fascinating thing about it and what kept me looking? I had never seen a movie that offered absolutely nothing before. It is a movie without any reason to exist at all, apparently intentionally designed to appeal to no one, as if it is only a contractual obligation for someone that the studio really does not like. There is no plot, there is no characterization, there are no set action scenes, there are not even scenes as such, only a progression of increasingly empty images projected to 24 frames per second. Second. I'm not talking about empty as in stupid summer blowers, but empty as in "We haven't got the pages yet, so just point the camera at something and stop when you have 90 minutes worth." It enables you to appreciate the 'artistic achievements' of Charlies Angels and S.W.A.T. so much more. What it offers is way too much of Giovanni Ribisi on his most boring modest making his bastard son of a thousand morons mimics the Marlon Brando method, which acts as routine, Michael Lerner dances with Omar Epps and ?? No it is. Oh, Clare Danes has a good smile in a shot. And Dennis Farina has the meaning to be turned off early. Really the most utterly meaningless movie ever made, it's like L'Humanite without the jokes, but you know, for kids.
