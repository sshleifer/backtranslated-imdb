Bridget Fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of the beautiful Hart Bochner. One afternoon she comes home, calls him "treasure" and puts him to drink a drink to find out he is starving. Minutes pass by while she compliantly sets up with her frowning silence. Suddenly he breaks into an anger and blames her for adultery in complete lack of reason to do so, calling her the C word, hitting her head against a closet, turning her around and jumping her off the second floor balcony, breaking her hand and a few ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital where it is revealed she is deaf, even though we notice she is reading lips perfectly. It avoids all the awkwardness associated with an ASL interpreter or has its squawk words in a simulacrum of language. <br /> <br /> Okay. Just let me put out the basics. This beautiful and devoted disabled woman is beaten by her husband, misunderstood by her elderly mother, betrayed by her sister, her bank account emptied by unknown hands, almost raped by a fat man hanging in a bar, believed to have murdered her now missing man and pursued by two police (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other seems to resist all women and is embarrassed by their presence. The end finds her standing alone in an abandoned bus stop with a hand full of cash - alone, tearful but brave. Now, a pop quiz. There is only one multiple choice question. "This story is written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." Not to sound sexist. One can just as easily set a scenario of a decorated military hero and trained warrior, trapped by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, escaping to exact revenge and won with the woman he loves as he believed d lost long ago. <br /> <br /> The direction is functional and conventional. When the Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, from his point of view we see the faces of the nervous doctors and nurses looking down at her - that is, by the camera - an echo of all scenes in countless precise films in which the gurney has rushed down The corridor and people wearing star white coats and festooned with stethoscopes hover over the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner has played a number of evil people in an interesting way - some of the characters are stupid ("die hard") and some are quite more than ordinary rude ("and the sea will tell"). His virile silence has a kind of malignant hue to it. It would be too easy to throw him like a hero. Nice, deliberately gentle performance by Steven Weber as the stupid policeman - perhaps the best in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Her recording area is limited, but it is full screen here. What makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty. She is like a high school prom queen. Very feminine. Of course, she can't help it if she turns around or moves her hands so gracefully. She can't do anything about her nose either. Most of its length is quite normal and attractive, but at least there is a bump outward that follows the natural flare of the nostrils. The tip of the nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the movie - Pfui.
