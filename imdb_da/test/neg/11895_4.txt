I saw this last night at Tribeca Film Fest and holy god it was bad. From the script editing to the actor to cinematography - none of it worked. Not to mention the put design / costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it ranges from the years from the late 70s up to 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who is usually a great actor, was so over-top-ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but Hurt got nothing to do with here. I don't know much else to say except the audience, I saw it with absolutely loved it .. so maybe it's just me. But the audience loves something at film festivals when they sit next to the director and all the actors. It is not a very accurate test of how well the movie is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought this movie was horrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was fun. Get full and give it a shot when it is on HBO in 2 years if it ever does so far.
