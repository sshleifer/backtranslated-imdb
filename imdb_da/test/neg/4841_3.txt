This is said to be the first Polish Western and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known in the United States as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY, this movie uses some strange pictures to tell a story that lacks dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a bad way. My favorite is a young man who builds a gallows chop out of one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself and tests the strength of the rope. A cowboy known as "the stranger" (Karel Roden) finds a dead man (Kilmer) whom he thinks is a desired man. He takes him to the nearest town to collect bounty. He ends up losing the body and the potential bounty in a game with the city's drunken sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and has turned the few cities against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid (Katarzyna Figura). He manages to escape safe death and leads the little bag on a dangerous 'wild goose chase'. One scene has the stranger who tends to get a scalp wound by cauterizing with reptiles and a fight. The raven is linked to a hitching post that the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had. This movie, also known as SUMMER LOVE, has a scary theme song sung by John Davidson. Nevertheless, this Western is like seeing a train wreck. There's just something that doesn't tell you to see ... but you do.
