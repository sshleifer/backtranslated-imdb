High school woman track star dies of a clot after winning a race with the community in a rebellion against Coach George Michael's (Christopher George plays him as a big ass head that is very demanding of the athletes under his watch). He gets canned after school so he can give the girl with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopaths in sweat (much the same as what Michaels are often seen wearing), using a stopwatch on time for his executions, murder the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of. Soon disturbed parents call Princip Guglione (Michael Pataki) wondering why their children did not come home after a party party. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) starts sniffing around campus at the request of concerned parents. Immediately, a besieged Michaels becomes a primary suspect after a gymnast has been found in a closet. Ensign Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned from her base in Guam to receive her death gossip education and soon confronts the killer even in the climatic hunting scene. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is the tired girlfriend of the wasted star. <br /> <br /> Instead of relaxing in the deaths, you try to mix humor inside and not fail. Low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter, such as a sword embedded in a football thrown into a football player, or a pair of garden saucers used to celebrate a bad soul taking a leak. Linnea Quigley has a fun role as horny student Dolores, who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher class and always hunt for a male stud (the recipient of the garden scissors before he has the opportunity to sleep Dolores outside the prom party). Vanna White has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the closet. Virgil Frye has a silly role as an inept officer.
