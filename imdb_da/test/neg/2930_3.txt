Well, I generally like Iranian movies, and after watching "10" by Kiarostami the night before, I expected a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far the worst Iranian movie and one of the most boring Asian movies I've ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie before, see "Ten" instead. If you want some good Iranian movies, you can also try "Sib", also "The Apple". This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, with some funny ducks, is worth seeing. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably won't see anymore. I don't blame you, but you will miss some great movies.
