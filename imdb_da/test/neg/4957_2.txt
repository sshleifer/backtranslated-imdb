Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a college student with some serious anger issues. His family was brutally murdered when he was a child of a monster, and now he takes his anger on everything and everyone. So when his professor (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of monsterism, he learns that he must control his anger and use it for good instead of evil and fight the creatures that have wasted their nightmares ever since the fateful night. Really earning his B-rating, but what was cool about it was that it didn't focus on crappy B-rated CGI graphics. In fact, 0% of the movie was CGI. The monsters were actually decently composed, and although the story was missing, it was somewhat visible ... if only once.
