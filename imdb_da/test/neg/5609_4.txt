Romantic comedy film is definitely the most fertile genre for bellow from average movies and the source of frustration for viewers. This is a perfect example of this and got a place in my "top 10 worst movies". The story is far from creative and the jokes are weak. I found no reason for a single laugh throughout the movie! Characters are commonplace and the players' performance and just good. The story slowly develops, it is boring and predictable. Ending is also predictable and sugar-coated. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you see in a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to see in my humble opinion.
