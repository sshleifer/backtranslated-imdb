I must have missed part of this movie ... I asked myself who is this? And when did it happen? It seemed to be jumping around, but I was watching for fear that I was missing something, and that would all be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but this movie made no sense to me. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the movie? It made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part. As far as the landscape - I thought it was fine. It made me feel like I was flipping through a book and leaving pages out. The ending was a little confused, although I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was supposed to wonder if his father would finally come home to his son and be the father since his mother was gone. I would like to read the book just to see what I missed in the movie .. I do not expect this to win any awards.
