Oh oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has a plot that STUNKS! Well, that's true, so come over it! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy, where his mistress star and money floated to make her an even bigger star. Today, there is only one fragmentary copy - one that was returned a few years back. But even though the film had been in perfect shape, it would still have stumbled for many reasons. And without further ado, here are some of my reasons: First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a monastery school - maybe aged 16 or 18! Come on - she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids. Secondly, the film hangs on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". While some people believe in this, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw everything on a woman, he didn't even know! What a lot of hooey! <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! After leaving school, Kelly goes out to East Africa and then becomes "The Queen of Hearing" - and later, after the evil queen dies back in Europe (which is practical), the prince can get out of prison, actually finds Kelly and marries with her and she then becomes queen of a genuine honest-to-goodness country! Gimme a break - it's RIDICULOUS, even in the times of silent movies, this plot was a groaner! <br /> <br /> In short, it's a bad movie with great production values ​​(mistresses have to look good) who parade around like a classic! There are so many better quiet movies out there - see them first and avoid this tripe.
