After big budget disaster films set in America like The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like Flood. <br /> <br /> Using primarily unknown actors and actresses, actually focusing on England it was a welcome change in the pace of watching The Empire State Building was demolished. <br /> <br /> But it's not a strong movie in any way. While it is quite shocking to see that all your favorite London landmarks are being knocked down by a very fake CGI storm growth, Flood doesn't really live on anything else. The performances are tedious and are rescued from the hell's hole by David Suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the Deputy Minister. He may be a little too calm for what is going on in the movie, all the fake water that throws around in London must have made him quite annoyed. It is understandable that the effects would not be as good as TDAT and DI, but CGI was at best average. <br /> <br /> Mix, disappointing and sometimes even tiring. See it if you need to, but see something else right afterwards.
