I have read almost all the books now and have seen musical production in two different languages. I absolutely loved everything I have been familiar with before. But lately I've run out of resources to maintain my fancy. I still have some books left, but they are either in transit or they are the successors I am not busy reading. So an idea started on me - Sink me! There are movies I haven't seen! Then I have to see them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of these series were ... acceptable. In fact, I really enjoyed the variation of the reason for the termination, however different it seemed. However, it went downhill anyway. Chauvelin was also ... foppish? And I daresay, too old for this role. Not nearly the dark and throbbing figure with its terrible either - or. (And what was the random bed scene with him? It was too insecure - wasn't his only love Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his job and his only occupation - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... The Prettiest Woman in France ? The smartest woman in Europe? I do not think. Although, what forced her to break into the study of Mr. Percy, I don't have the weakest idea. And what my master Tony has done to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the league promised his life to Sir Percy, but he would never have threatened any of them or would have run like a fig when his dear friend faces deadly danger. And if he in any way had to mourn his companion, he would have done it, mourn, not just continue as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Mr Percy. His portrayal was most horrible. He was also not a lazy fool, nor a gallant and elusive hero, who is a master of transformations. He did not care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of this word alone made my ears bleed) and with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So what happened to him by chance to walk around slaughtering people? The costumes were just too flashy during that period. This is post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in the dress as such stand out in a crowd quite easily. It was all just ... gah! Although I have to admit after looking at other parts, my opinion changed a little. Taking it as a separate job, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Just your second average in the mask. But for what they tried to pass it, it's still miserable.
