Garden State must be judged among the most preferred and pretentious films all the time. The reason is a simple one involving a young man who returns home after his mother's death and discovers love. But really it is not important. What is important for Zach Braff - author, instructor and star ?? is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' movie. We are therefore presented with endless sweet and crooked characters and scenes that do not exist because of ground or character development, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (Ã  la Wes Anderson - or so Braff hopes). Unfortunately and a little surprising, Braff has not only fooled many on IMDb, but also some critics who really should have known better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Braff's free use of evil alone doesn't make Garden State a bad movie. What really makes Garden State a stink is Braff's script. He simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film, and the dialogue and characterization are scary. Braff often has to resort to devising designs and symbolism to achieve what he cannot achieve through writing. For example, the feeling of the Braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending air crash (this cannot be worked into the plot and it must happen in a dream!) Later, he is shown back to his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss, very clever Mr Braff). These two scenes should be among the most ridiculous and confrontational ones ever seen on a cinema screen. On the plus side, the play is acceptable despite the lack of material to be thrown to work with (which means I mean a script), and I admire Natalie Portman for her effort as the interest of love - a character so poorly written and unbelievable that she is a little more than a thoughtless doll that Braff casts into his fantasy woman. <br /> <br /> It apparently took Braff 3 years to write the script to Garden State (3 years to write a script so badly - he's really unlucky!). Hopefully this is the time before he makes another movie.
