Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was bar none of the most frightening, most hopeful experiences I have ever had in a full movie theater. I'm not making fun. Being a self-declared japanophile has also made the girl look better in my eyes (if the setting had been changed to an American suburb, I would probably have ended up hating the movie). <br /> <br /> It said ... This movie is a complete mess! I won't say it sucks because A) the movie has some good points, B) "it sucks" is the lameest slap in the story of lame puts downs. So what does the movie have for it? Well, firstly, it has a beautifully cool look: Thanks to filters and the use of gloomy, washed out colors, Takashi Shimizu almost recreates the pristine, fearful atmosphere of the original. Some scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is simply poor. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere, told unnecessarily Tarantino style, ie the scenes are out of chronological order. This technique is pointless in the case of this movie, and it only makes things more confusing. Frankly, a fair plot would have worked better. The original also lacked plot-wise, but it made sense, and the film was more than made up for its thin plot with many scary and a really tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time. Let's not forget TV show acting skills that are thrown by the original Grudge resembling Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie doesn't work. It's too slow, too boring and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which doesn't add anything new to the story, by the way, so not even Grudge fans will be happy). <br /> <br /> What about the old man playing Japanese peek-a-boo on the bus ?? Is it supposed to be comical relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
