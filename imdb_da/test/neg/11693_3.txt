I'm a fan of the horror movie, no matter what hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and I was looking forward to a slow build of ever-increasing excitement and scary kids with odd, heterogeneous movements hiding under quilts. <br /> <br /> The biggest selling point for this movie was that it has a much more linear storyline than many of these ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are, and what they do. You get the baseline information (lovely couple, can't have kids) and realize that the premise is just too normal for something freaky, NOT to happen. <br /> <br /> Then comes the bad. The first complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I got it pretty much the moment the baby hugged the tree. I knew where the movie went and was even able to predict the death order and for what reason. <br /> <br /> Editing is shocking and unfortunately not beneficial to the movie. Even though I was still considering the events, tensions should not build because the director seems to have got a new editing package for his birthday and would use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final gripe is this ... the tree was unnecessary. This would have been a perfectly good story of subtle horror, with just the couple crashing over the child's death - the title tree didn't buy anything new or exciting for the movie. So I want to finish where I started - my overall impression was 'Oh.'
