This is a really really bad movie. It may seem like a simplification. A dull, childish retort that can be compared to a petty uninhibited insult. The truth is, I'm not enough, I can say about the confusing meaningless plot, the really cruel act (I'm talking nasty people here) or the random images of violence against women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically terrible movies - to make mistakes That drives this front to everything that is good and decent in the cinema world, no, human culture. Please take my word for it, don't see it ... ever. I am serious. Stop. You will thank me for that later.
