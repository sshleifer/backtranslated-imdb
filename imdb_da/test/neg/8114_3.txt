I'm sorry, but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi-classic and a scary movie, but seriously, I think when the director has me laughing, it's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were just so over the top and incredible. I just couldn't stop laughing at Issac's voice, it was like a tall whipped British voice. Not to mention Malicai's over dramatic stick up in his bullet. <br /> <br /> The children of darkness are about a city where all the children have killed the adults and worship a God who instructs them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people. When a couple has a bad car accident, they come to town for help, but of course they are caught in the child's trap and are being sacrificed! But Malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following Issac's orders. Corners children could have been good, but turned into a bad one over the top movie that you could easily make fun of. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure this is not what he intended, and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors ruined it. As I said, for a good laugh, see it, but I warn you, it's pretty pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
