This movie starts the way each movie should start, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm that goes around in their underground and / or topless. A few of them take showers. I like it so far! Unfortunately, we or the main characters meet. They are just not particularly sympathetic. Usually in these movies the actors are not right, they give very "natural" performances, and they are quite sympathetic, funny and sympathetic. Not here. They don't have much of any personality, and I didn't care much about them. <br /> <br /> Some of the girls go on a camping trip to school. Along the way, they stop at a petrol station for backwoods and meet a bendend. The Biker band really should have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it's just stupid. The main biker looks like a middle-aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out to the forest and later the biker bend follows them. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what happens after that. There are a lot of things about the world ending because it is the end of the millennium, so some of the cyclists are killed by a mysterious Indian guy who disappears. Someone is eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as he swims over a lake. Some guy in stupid makeup is apparently a druid, and he has to sacrifice some of the girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world, I'm afraid I didn't pay much attention. First he dresses the girls in animal shorts. It could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker hallway ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn't even meet my class Z schlock expectations. They really should have eliminated half of the plate elements and only focused on one or two things. Instead, it's everywhere. Overall, if you are looking for late '80's, I imagine you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There is plenty of nudity in the beginning, but the signs are bad and the plot is too scary to be even the least satisfying.
