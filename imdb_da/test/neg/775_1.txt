It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad I plan to rent it again as soon as I can find it. This movie makes 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' look like an Oscar contender. Just looking at the actors makes me laugh aloud. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. It's terrible it's perfect. <br /> <br /> The reason is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). It's as far as I can go ... I laugh too hard. I know it shouldn't be fun, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> Move over ED WOOD !!! <br /> <br /> Regards * DATE *
