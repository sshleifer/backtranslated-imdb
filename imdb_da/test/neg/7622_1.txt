Interesting subject. Pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, is drying out and having his emergency world first life restoration surgery. Here is the fun. The underlying problem is that Miles has no sweet !!! This is used to explain its quasi-different behavior to be indirectly responsible for two deaths (I think this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the livelier side, Miles prefers the odd glass of brandy, fiery fireplaces and his young mature female cousin. The final is actually right for this movie. <br /> <br /> Some thoughts: 1. Producer $ was signposted to create this tripe. J.D. Feigelson was the screenwriter and one (or one) producer. It looks like he did not learn a lesson on "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" when one sees his other written credits. This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! This is really scary. Must be forever "The bottom of the shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A remnant human being without soul will be an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The result provides minimal support. Not even an in-form Jerry Goldsmith could save it. <br /> <br /> 5. Deserved the 0230 time slot on television and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials + test patterns it competed against at the time of my viewing. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately, no successors spared all of Wes Craven's franchise "Nightmare". Chiller Too: Return Return of Miles, or something similar. <br /> <br /> Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this movie as a good example of how to kill a play or script-writing career. This should apply to governance, but Wes Craven will forever be exempted by his only good piece of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" 1984.
