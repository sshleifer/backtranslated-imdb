Problems: 1) Although billed as "a loving tribute to poverty line", many of the old recordings are not even from Poverty Row movies - much of it is from RKO's "The Dangerous Game" (1932), with some from the quiet ( !?) version of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old footage is used only as a filler (the old ship recordings) or repeatedly silent images (for example, by Bela walking, looking or staring); <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the pantheon of poverty-stricken master thespians (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) who receive their lines as strokes to the "new" characters jokes (as in Woody Allen's "What is Tiger lily?" or Steve Martins "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid")? Even Mike Nelson's faint comment on the colored "Reefer Madness" is more fun than this. <br /> <br /> High Point: The long but extremely informative lecture by Gregory Mank that gives you new respect and admiration for Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. It's worth the price of the DVD alone!
