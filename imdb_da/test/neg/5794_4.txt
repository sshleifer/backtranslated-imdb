Although Disney is guilty of cash cow disease, following the roaring success of The Love Bug in 1968, the mouse's house was paid for by Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. Neither the successor catches the charm and the unofficial appeal of The Love Bug back in 68, here we find the race driver Jim Douglas and his sidekick Wheely Applegate, into the Herbie in the Monte Carlo Rally. Of course, things outside the race begin to take over priorities, they are mixed in a diamond robbery, and Herbie falls in love with another car! The car jumpers are of course comfortable and light on the eye, and it would be miserable for me to really close poison on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the movie does not go fast and personally now I can see it for the coin motivated work it is . Still you will see that Herbie takes a bath, fouls the evil and of course dances for the lady in her life, then something for everyone I think ................... 0 , 4/10.
