Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good celluloid and the actor's efforts. A formal movie is not necessarily bad if it pays off on the promise that this movie does not. It's a tiring mix of movie clich√©s that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past. It is full of random and empty plot phrases that add nothing but pointless action, such as a tour of the protagonists to a ghost town, where the villain (inexplicably) follows them. This, of course, was perceived as an excuse for a shooting range and the escape scene that adjoins the perishable, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows as they shoot guns together. It makes you think that someone told Becket that there was a ghost town in the Chilean foot, and he said, "Oh well, let's make a shooting space there." <br /> <br /> Don't waste your rent on this. It's a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different movies thrown together to call an action drama.
