For sci fans it will be better than anything that is likely to run on TV at any time it's about the best you can say about it. Good pointer; repartee and sense of humor are less boring than usual in such films, the plot is coherent and does not use any magical mysterious revelations. Bad points; the authors try to do good science, but it falls in the direction and production (eg a rock drill using overheated rock drilling equipment breaks surface under water with a bubble or boiling cauldron), the signs are clich√©s and the plot unfolds is quite stock standard. OK for an overly tired-to-do-something-other type of evening; But don't expect any major build or even talk points really.
