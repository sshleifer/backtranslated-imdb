I'm sorry. But if you have seen this "epic", you will of course know about the complete disregard of the actual text of the Bible. Now I'm not exactly the next in the queue for the weekend, but I know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to dry all of the earth's surface because he thought they had been damaged to the point where they did not return. He chose Noah, the red diamond, and his family was spared because of their incorrect ways. Noah builds a sheet directed by God to house him, his family, and two of all creatures as he overflows the rest of the planet. That's the basics. In this movie you have other people roaming around the seas like peddlers and pirates. But I thought everyone was wiped out. I think the leaders of NBC have never been to church. There are other inaccuracies I am told, but being the average Joe, I have no idea what they are. Pardon. Back to the movie it was inaccurate, as mentioned earlier, the acting stunk, but some of the effects were good, I give it. But as a whole, I've seen a better and more tasteful release of the story done as a small scene on The Simpsons. God helps NBC leaders come doomsday. 3.10
