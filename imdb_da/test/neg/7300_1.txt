A post-apocalyptic warrior goes out to rescue some kind of Nun and on the way some cyber punks meet on skates who want to kick his ass. This is one of the hardest to see movies ever. There are scenes of silence that seem to last hours before someone comes out with the next poorly written, poorly behaved line. There are action sequences that continue to repeat - and we're not talking quickfire 1-2-3 action repetition at a particularly good kick that became popular by Eastern Directors, we speak many many repetitions of long, bad fighting sequences. This is incredibly confusing at first, but so quickly it becomes annoying as you see a 30 second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. Any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity. The only thing that keeps this movie in the video play (apart from the bet from a friend that I couldn't see it all the way without asking for it to be turned off and safely disposed of so it can't hurt others) is the fact that, even though it is painful, this movie is inadvertently fun, I'm not at all a fan of those who are so bad that it is fun, but in parts I was in tears. Other points to note are the quality of the sound and the picture, but it is forgivable as it is obvious money was a major problem with this movie. Final judgment - King of "so bad that they are funny" genres, everyone who has that kind of genre video night, must get a copy. Let's not forget that it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen.
