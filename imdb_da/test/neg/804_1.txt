Where do I start? The story was so bad it must have been written in a high school! The action was so wood, I felt sorry for the actors! An actor even reminded me of what a deer should look like when you stare into the car's headlights! Another actor has this constant look to be constipated! But it was the dialogue that took the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero says to his hunters - everyone is holding submachine guns - if you put a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead. Moments later, the strongest guard built like a truck, and the only female prisoner goes on it. When our fearless leader, who has this very annoying ravenous gangster voice, catches the wind of this violation, he quietly goes up to the guard while machine guns are trained on him and in a split second, this gigantic neck of the neck is snapped as if he were breaking a tooth pick! He then comes back in the queue, while all the bad guys with their machine guns are doing absolutely nothing, but screaming essentially at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on again! This movie is camp gem and if you have any sense of humor, it is guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!
