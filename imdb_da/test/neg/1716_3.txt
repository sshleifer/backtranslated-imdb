It is certainly a direct-to-video, but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think. I like the hero doing the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The reactions of the hero and the reactions of the rebels are just human. Hopper character actually plays god. It may be the right thing to do, but you don't like it anyway. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the god player is doomed to death, and the hero who would have spent his own life can Directly. Completely moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I saw is that the earth does so well without moon stabilizing its rotation.
