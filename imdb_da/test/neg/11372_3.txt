This movie was not so bad when the story went, but the camera's work is what makes it hard to see. I just don't like the so-called "realistic" camera work that is being done today; you know type-jump from the middle, pan, etc. What made me particularly annoyed by this movie, but it was the new thing they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene. I think the movie would have been much better if the camera's work was shot in a much more conventional way, because I as such couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead. Perhaps if more people express dissatisfaction with the camera's work like this, the filmmakers will finally get the hint.
