This is defiantly a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of the cast members, but the story never took me right. Don't expect "Oh brother where are you" in any form or form. The smallest part in my opinion is when the war army explains what happens in Argon. Seems they were trying to copy some of Clooney's funny facial expressions from "Oh brother where are you" but you could say they tried it. John Krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout. Renee Zellweger plays that part of an avid reporter who is willing to do anything for the story. All in all, it's a movie worth watching at home.
