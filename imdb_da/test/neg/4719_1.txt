this movie is what happens when people look like in this one blair witch project and say hell people run around with cameras, play slash documentary theme no problemo i can do it and start with a lame idea make a terrible script and get a bunch Talented actors and start shooting a movie. The plot is that in Africa there is a half-cast of people as animals that hunt and kill people. The locals think it is a demon or an evil spirit, but our wildest is in Africa to get some evidence that there is one. no need for more words on the plot this movie gets a 1 out of 10 and i try to find something good to say about this movie, but after a long time nothing thinks nothing null zero.
