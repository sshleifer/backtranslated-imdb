George Sluizer of THE VANISHING fame (he made both the scary European original and Hollywood remake) aimed at CRIMETIME. He should not really be blamed for this confused, bad movie, because all the problems lie in the Brendan Somers script. It is poorly focused and stupidly written. For example, the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim, any victim, and start talking to a teenage girl. Cut to the next scene where she tells the villain "I told you all about myself, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately, the girl has told baddie his life story out of the screen and is a terrible example of not being able to bring a sign to life through dialogue. I know for a fact how bloody difficult this is, but for a script produced, the author must have tried harder. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain the film's message. At some points, it feels as if it is trying to be a British NATURAL BORN KILLER that satirizes the media's voyeurism with crime (perhaps it has even affected the infamous video game MANHUNT), but the script is not witty enough to carry it away. When you have a sex scene that does not develop the plot or character or hint of subtitle, you know you have a badly written play and CRIMETIME is a poorly written play
