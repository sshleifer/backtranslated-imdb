Did they try to capture a serial killer, had they ever thought of tracking the license plate number on the black van or fingerprint of the video tapes he sent? Oh brother the plot of this movie was so full of holes, it was pathetic. Now I know why there are bad movies in the world. However, this one was one of the worst.
