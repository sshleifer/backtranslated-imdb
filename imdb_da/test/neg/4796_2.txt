It did not feel like a movie, and was fortunately short (under 90 minutes), it felt more like a commercial option in computer graphics: most of the special effects are great, to be safe. But that doesn't make it really good or even a good movie. Not to say it is absolutely worthless to see, as it is possible to see what are the possibilities of CGI or GCI or what it is called. <br /> <br /> As I read somewhere, "You can't fix it in the cut room", a bad story and non-directed actors, can't be solved in the cutter room or even with the most magnificent special effects! Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from. <br /> <br /> But they thought this could be sold in the US, is not an idea, as the US is the bad guys. <Br /> <br /> And it's not so typical of low budget stories, they have to create an imaginative country south of Mexico ?? Well, I gace it 2! Just because of the special effects, the rest is an absolute waste bin!
