This seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known films, and it's easy to understand why. Taken at face value, it is not a bad movie, but there is nothing special about it either. Nothing happens at all during the film, it's simply the story of Chris and Leonora's horrible affair and Barbara's reaction to it. The only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know it will end badly for some reason due to the first scene. Strangely, there are many perfect opportunities in the history of conflict, and none of them are exploited. For example, if Barbara had fallen off with Leonora, it would have been much more interesting and trustworthy, but the two remained good throughout the film. The concept of Barbara being betrayed by her friend was not at all explored - in fact, she did not even seem to be betrayed by her husband; she even calls on him to take a holiday with Leonora. Similarly, Chris's two secretaries, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who are also close friends of both Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim is away from conflicts by telling Chris that he is terribly fond of both him and Barbara. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest flaw in the movie is the fact that we don't care whether Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara. The two women's personalities are inseparable anyway, so we do not know which of the two is better suited to be with Chris, and besides this, Barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she is hardly concerned about the matter. In addition, I found Chris and Leonora's relationship somewhat convincing. I can overlook the ridiculously short time frame when they fall to each other because it is so common in movies in this era, but even then the relationship seemed low. Coward's character was too strong and cynical to be the subject of Leonora's feelings. He reminds me of the socially scary genius Sir Earnest Pease from the movie "Very Important Person" - I'm sure the two would have gotten good. Chris's cold and tightening made his love for Leonora seem inappropriate. I think Coward should have put one out and given his share to a younger man - as I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a gloomy, most numb, bald middle-aged man. Despite all my criticism, the film still manages to be interesting - just not terribly convincing. That none of the characters are particularly well-developed gives them an enigmatic character, which is something exciting. The astonished heart is definitely worth looking at, but it's a flawed piece of cinema.
