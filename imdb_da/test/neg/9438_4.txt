I know this movie was shown on local TV when I was a kid, but I can't remember if I saw it or not; see it now, considering how completely forgettable it is, i still don't know ?? so I counted it as a first impression! There have been several films with the title character, a creation of the visionary French writer Jules Verne; These include: 20,000 LEAGUES DURING SEA (1954, with James Mason in the role), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961; Vincent Price), MYSTERIE ISLAND (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO, and THE WATER CITY (1969; Robert Ryan) and the mysterious the island of CAPTAIN NEMO (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version stars the Oscar winner Jose Ferrer. But even if the premise is not half bad? awakened from suspended animation in its submarine, "The Nautilus" and finding itself in modern times, Nemo adopts all its ingenuity to help the US Navy defeat the megalomaniac scientist Burgess Meredith ?? It's just as easy his most infantile adventure yet! For example: Five seconds in the movie, Meredith's assistant ?? Donating a steel mask ?? ranks that "The world must be us!"); just as fun are the zealous gestures of the correspondingly ornate midget whose task is to fire the Professor's all important "Delta Beam" - and what about the android-type minions aboard Meredith's ship, which never seems to do much of anything? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout, but Meredith is an embarrassing sensation (in what is almost a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s BATMAN TV series and movies) where the budget was so tight ?? mainly invested in gentle production design and shoddy special effects, no doubt, and both apparently influenced by STAR WARS (1977) ?? that apparently they couldn't even afford him a decent costume (he looks positively idiotic with a tie in a sub)! The support model includes Mel Ferrer (plays a saboteur in Joan Fontaine's vein from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE TO THE SEA BOTTOM [1961], and who engages in a sneaky routine with his namesake in the engine room "Nautilus"), Lynda Day George (surprisingly, she's the only female character around) and Horst Buchholz (like King of Atlantis, no matter what reason, Nemo is obsessed with finding the famous lost continent). <br /> <br /> By the way, having been reduced from a three-part mini-series to the theatrical show, the movie obviously feels choppy ?? even though one can still see where an episode ended and another began.
