... I usually hate saying, but it seems the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard". I suppose I'm not the first one. And I'm sure many, many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with otters. It worried me just outside bats. But there is much more wrong with this movie than a basic lack of knowledge about how mammals work. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I was a parent, I would be annoyed by the violent turn it takes near the end of the showdown with coyotes. (Although at least I have injected a little action.) And from a conventional screenwriting point of view, you can expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict (Gee you have a "widow" cow ... maybe she was "man "killed by coyotes? No, it's a much deeper explanation.) And what kind of farm is this? Otis promises to protect all the animals from harm, but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans. They refer to the farmer as a vegan, but what does he do pigs? In all of the children's animal stories - Babe, Charlotte's Web, you are called ... The reality of life is at least affected. Perhaps our friendly farmer runs some sort of rescue lure (there is a reference to this, but it has never been explained.) But all the farmers are returning is abuse from a horse in a scene that should be fun but left me seriously wondering whether he should shut down buried in a low digging bin. And what about "Wild Mike"? It was like the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without ball gag. Add in some really awful attempts at emotional scenes, an almost complete lack of laughs and YOUR OUTDOORS, and you've got the worst kids movies I've seen in ages. I usually only send to IMDb to highlight a movie that is not so well known - not to slam the current # 2 box office hit. But this movie attacked me. It took place in my local theater, space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. There has been plenty of good family entertainment this summer - in fact, there were at least 2 more children's games playing on the same multiplex. But I don't see anything like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can cheat families for an extra $ 30. At least I had a free passport. <br /> <br /> I know that as a 35 year old without children, this movie was not designed for me. But there's just no excuse for such a lazy, horrible children's movie like "Barnyard" in Pixa's age. I was sorry for the "Ice Age" movies, but they didn't give me anything like "Barnyard". "Shark Tale" was a weak attempt at street frequency, but it had a few laughs. To that extent, you can turn on Nickelodeon anytime of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent - so they must be ashamed to put their name on this waste. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 2 out of 10, just because Pip The Mouse was occasionally entertaining, and Maria Bamford had some entertaining lines as a farmer's wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmers. They do not really explain who she was. They didn't explain a lot of things. Especially not why Sam Elliot - the ultimate "man's man" - had a udder jiggling around down there. Spooky.
