Which production, what a waste of screen time and money. Here's what a European so-called producer thinks of a scifi movie. Take former model, Alexandra Kamp, pair a with an American c-class actor and get a movie business most notorious producer Harry A. Towers. Towers then find some unclear munich-based products, Tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and mix it all together without any script and you'll get "Sumuru" - an invaluable gem among the worst movies ever made! Get a live people and do something else, no matter what you do, no movie, thank you! To top it all, the producers went to film in South Africa, what you see on the screen is a huge sand hole, where "action" takes place between extremely bad actors and extremely bad, for example, that any movie studios would do better.
