Salena Incident is by far the director, Dustin Rikert, best movie --- which doesn't say much. In his earlier films (and I use the term "movie" loosely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood movie busts and seriously marginalizes them. The Salena incident is no different. The film is basically Con Air meets foreigners made with the play of your average film school production. The film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes. For example, almost every explosion on the screen is the same fire effect that is matted over the screen. <br /> <br /> The weak effects and production values ​​are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. In a sentence, the story strings together as an exhibition of overused Hollywood clichés. The movie begins with the worst CGI Alien ship that has ever entered the worst CGI land ever made, and a team of army somethings goes down to investigate. Then, a prison bus that carries the worst of the worst of the entire state is selected by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants. The prisoners escape and run into the town of Salena, where they encounter aliens who ... SHOCK ... have escaped from a foreign prison transport carrying the worst of the worst of the galaxy. The prisoners and their imprisoned police armed with only arms and sad sayings must fight off aliens and flee the city before the international space alliance * rolls their eyes * bombing the city for oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only real entertaining part of the movie is when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) get the freedom to improvise and also when they fight for the smaller of the alien creatures in a flame of pistol fire. Apart from that, the movie is really not worth any time, let alone plastic, as the DVD is made of. How terrible was that? Let's just say that the Defense Minister is about 90 years old, working in a room that deals with a high tech 1950's real estate agency and has a Looney Tunes tie. Yeah, if it wasn't clear enough before, MAN'S IN THE PENTAGON'S BUY A TIE WITH BUGS BUNNY AND THE WAY ROUND ON IT. The film culminates basically (HAHAHahhaaa said I am culminating ...) with the last remaining soldier entering the group of prisoners and guards, and the new formed team is fighting their way away from the evil aliens --- as for one or more Another strange reason is bringing them right back to the Alien ship? yeah ... <br /> <br /> The movie has a heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. Someone seriously needed to relax DP and tell him that there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant, chest-level shots. This movie is really not worth renting (if it ever does so far) that it is not as cruel as the last movies made by the director, which reduces the laughter's ability, but it is nowhere near to see movie.
