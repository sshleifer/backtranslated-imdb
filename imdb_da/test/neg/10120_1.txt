This movie is really so bad and I'm usually a sucker for bad movies, but it was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded through all titles from Full Moon and Troma, all the films by Edward D. Wood Jr., Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD flicks from faded acts. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a great selection of movies that MST3K covers, but in their original form. But you don't really know horrible filmmaking before you've seen Darkhunters. And if you don't, you shouldn't. Do not want to. Not only is this movie incredibly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted and split into raw, cheap aftermath. First of all, it's a pretentious mess. But not good, Greenaway or Lynch-style pretentious or hilarious mess in an Ittenbach or early Waters kind of fashion. It's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone is incredibly stupid, thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart. Kind of like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only that man seems like a freakin messiah when compared to this train-breaker (and it comes from a creepy shaymalan hater). It's also boring. Not heavy that goes boring, which is okay if the movie assigns your patience. Darkhunters doesn't do that. It is boring in a "Oh my fu (King God, if I see another shot of a cat set to an unpleasant audio queue, I must fire (King kill myself!"). A kind of way. > <br /> Btw Anyone who claims to like this movie is a bold liar, and anyone who claims that this movie is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed.
