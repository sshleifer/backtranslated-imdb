The director spent a lot of time making the scenes real right down to the historical pictures and all the sounds of the old western bustle. At times, the producers and the author / director, Michael Cimino, spent no time on any of the historical facts about what the Johnson County War was really about. Much of the war was about how public fields should be used for grazing. The cat lovers did not want the poor sheep herders in the country to compete for feed on this cold, wind-blown plateau. The whole epic does not mention grazing sheep, which was one of the main causes of the war. The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown around the warlords as a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood films. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a pose of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the guards and caught them in a barn at the TA Ranch. I doubt any women were involved in the siege. <br /> <br /> Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) to discredit her. The fact that the plot causes her to be a brothel merely serves WSGA's interests. <br /> <br /> I protest against the use of names of real people in a plot that is so natural fiction. There is no fact in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people loosely associated with the Johnson County war (and events that led to it) are beyond me. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been much more interesting if it had lived on the political consequences of the federal government's intervention in a state government and what happened after the WSGA soldiers were rescued by Calvary. Some efforts were made to prosecute the cattlemen responsible for Johnson County lawyer. But when Johnson County could not afford the court costs and the Wyoming governor, Amos W. Barber, supported the WSGA, the charges were eventually lost. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert's nude for much of the three and four / four hour running time on the DVD version.
