A whole lot of teens gather around to discuss their fears, but an intruder has appeared and kills everyone. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst horror movie in the 90s is Camp Blood (1999) the only movie that can challenge it to that title, having some of the stupid characters and situations to enjoy a television screen. The so-called surprise ending is horrible, just like the rest of this movie. Mildly entertaining at such a bad level is the good level. My rating: 2 out of 10.
