While the dog was cute, the movie was not. It was not the premise or the issue that was a problem. The priest had good opportunities for humor and pathos both. The theme is a worthy one. Helping other people is more important than gathering a fortune. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the adorable dog, the unique premise and the theme became the underdog of poor acting, stylized dialogue and amateur movies. <br /> <Even my youngest child who wants to sit through almost everything gave up before we had come halfway through. How many times can that dog run up and down at the same time? I can't ruin it for you, as I never saw the end. It was just not worth seeing all the way to the end.
