A boring movie about a miserable loser ... it's Factotum in a nutshell. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, changing the ego of author Charles Bukowski on whose novel the movie is based. When we meet Chinaski, he may be an author, but he is certainly not a successful one. He flies through life, is fired from a private job after another and does not care a bit. That he is always full may have something to do with his not caring. He meets with a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor and a relationship follows. Chinaski moves into Jan's apartment, and instead of being full of himself, he can be full of another. Good times. Eventually he has had enough of this relationship, so Chinaski knocks out alone. Unfortunately, he still can't hold a job so fast enough that he's broken. At this point Marisa Tomei and for some reason shows her character, Laura, to save this miserable, drunk loser, whom she doesn't even know. We soon meet some of Laura's acquaintances, and the film jumps into a kind of bizarre world with this rather eclectic bunch. Soon, Tomei and friends are out of the picture, and again we are back with Chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life. There is a little more time with Jan, but for the most part there is just time to be a full, free loser. And then the movie is over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it works infinitely longer as the film draws on. Nothing happens. Nothing ever happens. If you want to spend an hour and a half on your life, then Matt Dillon drinks, it's the movie for you. If you're looking for a compelling story, well-developed characters, or any entertainment value, then you've come to the wrong place. Dillon's performance is not bad at all. In fact, the film that surrounds him is pretty bad.
