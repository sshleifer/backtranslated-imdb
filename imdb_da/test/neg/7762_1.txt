Week after week, these women sweep all the men off their feet. Get real. None of these women are "Knockouts". Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) looks like the type of woman men would pick up! Yet she is the queen's bee, a super-sexy killer killer. The other three are not much better. And their constant, foul mouthed comments ..... not to mention that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never catch a disease. This show is pathetic and scary. I don't think anyone would be terribly attracted to any of these women, even though he popped Viagra as Tic Tacs while on land.
