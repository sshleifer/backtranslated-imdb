The opening scene really made me see the movie. But no more than 5 minutes later, I already blinked my eyes. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the play could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. One highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. But I didn't quite get the connection to how a white midget was the child of two African Americans. But I think everything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie? I'm not sure it added anything artistic. Overall, I strongly recommend you to jump out of a rock before renting this movie.
