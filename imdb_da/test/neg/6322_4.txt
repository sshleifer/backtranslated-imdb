New York lawyer suddenly frees her senile mother after meeting an attractive, accessible woman. Screenwriter Robert Klane, who adjusts his own novel (the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirty parts), does not seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: it is just an excuse for prurient comedy and skatological jokes. George Segal - who starred most in war and espionage pictures in the 1960s - had become one of America's greatest sadder comics; His nutty reactions and wise answers only rival his mother's inscrutabilities. Segal is mated well with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of connection (though also the play for laughs) are really the only sequences one can dig against. Ruth Gordon, dear as she, is simply too much - and more of her is less. This is one of the worst-edited and edited movies I've ever seen from so-called professionals. Promising scenes that ultimately do not play to the full effect are deleted from other moments that flutter infinitely, making the wrong, scary movie for self-destruction long before it actually ends. * 1/2 from ****
