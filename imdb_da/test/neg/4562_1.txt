I think if you like to see that dudes are "pumped up" to monstrous sizes, this is right up your alley. Otherwise, it is an exercise in ego. Neither do I need to. Anyone who is of historical interest I think to see how these muscle positive and brain negative chumps got that way (before / after / and between steroids) - but otherwise it won't affect many guys and, as for women, well, i'm not one so i can't say ....
