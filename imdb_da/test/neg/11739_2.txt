A remake of a successful movie can at best be a difficult task; Re-creating a true classic, especially one that is truly the final film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else again. And having seen this version of `Psycho 'directed by Gus Van Sant, two things come to mind immediately: what is the meaning and what on earth did they think? Especially in view of the fact that Van Sant used the same play (by Joseph Stefano, taken from the novel by Robert Bloch) that Hitchcock used. The final result here underscores some of the finest points in film creation: First, a "remake" should be the same; a retooling of the original, rather than a `copy 'using new players; and secondly, that recording in color, using more blood and being a bit more graphic, does a little more than what affects the film's impact. Although this was a noble effort from Van Sant, it is ironic enough, finally, to suffer the same error that Norma Bates was hit by: The movie's "mind" was shared; half was Hitchcock, half of Sant Sant. And the two, however, met must never be bound. Van Sant, even the work of the original script, would have been better to make his own movie - all the way through - rather than trying to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with specific scenes. The movie's opening image, for example and especially the 'shower' scene, is probably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema. Copying Hitchcock, from the shoots looking directly into the shower head to one of the drain, and using the same `scream! Skree! Skree! ' sound effects - even as a tribute to Hitchcock - again, only distracted from the story. And if you factor in the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you have another split in the movie's psyche. Macy is a great actor - one of the best character players in the business - and his performance here is excellent; But just as good as it is the attitude and delivery pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times) and apparently out of context with what Van Sant does. So the movie wins with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I saw 'House of Good Will Psycho Games'. <br /> <br /> As far as performances are concerned, Macy was as solid as they come, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a great job creating an original character that escaped the trap of trying an imitation by Janet Leigh. The weak joints were Viggo Mortensen (Sam) who made Marion's girlfriend so smearing and unpleasant that you asked why she had anything to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn, who - to put it as delicately as possible - was simply horrible as Norman Bates. His entire performance was an actor playing a role (and not very convincing); Affecting the effeminate way and punishing his speech with "spontaneous" outbreaks of maniacal laughter made his Norman more of a caricature than a character, absolutely incredible and pretentious. It gave the film the feeling of resuming a 'True Incident' you wanted to watch on a TV show; It would have been perfectly in line with the film's sensitivity to cut off Norman, sitting alone in his salon, to a shot of a sober face, Peter Graves, who was intonation: "That was the madness of Norman Bates on the fateful, rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of his car and into his life - "The support model includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie Car Dealer). If nothing else, Van Sants `Psycho 'is a curiosity that demonstrates that having a good director, a predominantly outstanding cast and a documented item script does not necessarily ensure success. Permitted, today's era with psycho-babble, "American Psycho" and Hannibal Lecter has effectively taken the edge out of a character like Norman Bates; but there is still a unique intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims, which remains forever intrusive and frightening; But Van Sant is unable to convey the sense of fear, the neck-bound fear of this movie. If there was ever a movie made that should have been earmarked directly for video, then it is. Even better, it had never been born. I rate this a 2/10
