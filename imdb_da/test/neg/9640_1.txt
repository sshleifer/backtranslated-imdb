I find it terribly ironic that "left" Hollywood continues to uncover its bets and make these horrible lukewarm films that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it. <br /> <br /> If you are a fifty survivor and a dedicated pacifist, and you hope for a complete condemnation of war born on the fourth of July or completely silent on the western front, this movie will really feel like a rip off. None of these soldiers question this war or any war or idea of ​​war. They are just about to make another trip. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are a patriotic American who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really feel like a rip off. None of these soldiers love America or even love the service. The way they pout and sulk make them across more like suburban teens than blue collar hard guys. It's not we were soldiers, and it's not true of the IWO JIMA. It's not even thoughtless action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe can't really carry this kind of movie. Although he is devastatingly sexy, in a rough trade, men's room, bisexual kind of way, it's hard to see him as a slowly spoken 'Texas boy who will stand up and count. This is not Sgt. Croft in Mailer is the NAKED AND THE DEAD. He is more like Joel in Truman Capote's OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS. He can't sell you the idea that he's been in battle and done his bit, or that he wants his wife and wants her right now. He fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, looks like he would prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from behind.
