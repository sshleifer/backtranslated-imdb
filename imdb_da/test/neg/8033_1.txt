Even Mel Gibson couldn't save this slop of a movie. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would Mel Gibson make a movie, I'm sure he couldn't sit and watch? What was it here A total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrenic lady who was also on some heavy medication drugs. For all filmists out there on heavy fabrics; You will love this movie.
