I'm not inclined to ranting and my expectations were low at first, but how did this seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some great ugly friends mean actors, and talent understanding, not that you have to go out and make a movie. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, ie. It should never have seen the light of day. Somehow, this nonsense found a distributor to help escape a 3 to 4 foot cabin. It goes from bad to worse. Talk about low budget, a torture scene consists of a guy who gets a mug of coffee thrown over him while he is tied to a chair. Obviously this is very painful because the big baby continues to scream in pain .... maybe he ordered the decaf !! The action is worse than wood (I could possibly see a tree for 30 seconds before I get totally upset if you can look at this nonsense for so long you are a better man than me!) And the battle scenes would be at home on a nursery playground. Do not touch this movie unless you enjoy pain (in that case, try to spill lukewarm coffee over yourself). I want to say it's so bad it's good, but it's really just awful.
