(HR is what Himesh called in the movie, I also think he likes it.) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented themselves fall into the same trap. I really like Reshamiya. That's great what he's done. No one in recent years has come back from the desert and made a mark for himself. <br /> <br /> And I really expected a great movie (What about the 50 Cr budget and the sweet actress). As intense as Reshamiya I thought, he would excel in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, is he depicted the same, but for what care? Just incompetence, carelessness, horrible action, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> Blunders rule. (Example: How can German police issue public instructions on a speaker in English? They communicate in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become the standard in the Bollywood line. There are some good directors, but also many bad ones. Worse, the majority just don't care. <br /> <br /> Songs are the only saving grace ... <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat this HR and find yourself a good director (low budget .. No problem). The villain really should have shaved his head instead of the wig you know. After all, it's a 50Cr movie.
