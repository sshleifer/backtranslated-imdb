Honestly, I met real Han Su Ying before and saw her portrayed by an American actress who does not look like anything Chinese do my head spin while I watch this movie Why can't Hollywood get Nancy Kwan instead .... at least the more true to the story ... cos for goodness sake ... Dr Han Su Ying is Chinese I know I have met her personally <br /> <br /> and looking at the whole cast .... so few asian faces in a movie about an Asian love story makes me wonder <br /> <br /> I think the play is good but without real Asian faces in an Asian love story makes the plot so majestic and a whole lot of Baloney < br /> <br /> It's like another movie I know of 'THE CONQUEROR' imagine my eyes jumping out when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse. ... how on earth can a man born a bred in MONGOLIAN STEPPES come up with an Alabama southern accent ??? !! and a cheap imitation of some Asian <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that someday I want to see Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel show <br /> <br /> would love to see it <br /> <br /> and laugh out the whole thing! <br /> <br /> Bowl
