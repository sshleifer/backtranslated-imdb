As a CA resident, I wanted to see jackholes that turn off the power stations to raise prices, also get time for prison. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. As they stood firm on how Enron rose and crashed, I found it very interesting. But when the film focused on the anti-Bush slope, it made me wonder if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It is nice to point out any connection Republicans had to Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The CA energy crisis happened during Davis's movement. Both were in the office under Enron's abuse, but they were not responsible either way. Instead, many minutes are spent on how Bush was friends with Lay. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom. Why do Democrats get a free pass in this movie? I think most politicians are wasting our taxable money, so I'm not biased to one of the parties, but I hate to feel I'm subject to a person's political agenda when I see a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some guilt, but I really doubt that the only culprit has R's by their names. I found no value in portraying Bush's as Kay lovers, as Democrats received as much Enron campaign money as the Republicans did. As I said, it weakens the rest of the movie for me, because it makes me suspicious of the other facts they do.
