I don't know if this type of movie was like a clich√©, as it seems to be now. However, considering how many "Bad News Bears" films had already been released in 1980, I think this kind of movie was already a tired idea. <br /> <br /> A former soccer player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is limited to a wheelchair. Chicago Bears offers him a PR job, but he wants to train. At the same time, his underground nephew is taken to armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now earn something hard ... which turns out to be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the child is actually a good child who only needs a hard male role model in his life. The same applies to all the children in the detention facility. Yes ... even one locked for attempting to murder! I'm sure you already know what's going on, so I'll try to keep the rest of this card. <br /> <br /> Our main character is coaching the children's football team. He overcomes the delinquents' cynicism and serves their respect. His team faces a local high school team (yes right!) And they get their kicks kicked. Now, more than ever, to prove himself a worthy coach, he requires a rematch. Will these underprivileged, scrappy children with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win rematch? Terrible performance of the football sequences destroys any possibility of excitement in this movie. "Coach of the Year" should be punished for coarse my brain. 1.10
