Relesed from Troma (which is my favorite movie company) Unspeaksble is a messy horror movie that can be interesting but very dark and twisted. <br /> <br /> Inexplicably starting with a family in a car they come into an accident leaving a daughter dead and a mother deformed. The father eventually becomes crazy and scores prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He kills for her. Meanwhile, his now deformed wife is raped by his order. These are sick people! <br /> <br /> Indescribably trying to be sick and disturbing, and succeeding in making it a good scare, it's not. Most Troma films have a sense of humor, but it does not.
