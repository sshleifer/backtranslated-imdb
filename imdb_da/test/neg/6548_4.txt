Officially the first martial arts movie in the USSR movie with actual martial artists such as Tadeush Kas'yanov and Russian Bruce Lee - Talgat Nigmatullin. Bad people highjack a ship in the open sea, but fortunately almost everyone on board is a trained martial artist. A collectible for martial arts aficionado.
