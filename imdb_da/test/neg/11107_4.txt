Let me first say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The casting is like the hiding of the bell association, the monster is a guy in a bad clothes and as always; The military is useless. It seems that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely you are to die if you are in a cheesy low budget horror movie. Apparently, the people of the film industry have a little respect for the navy seals, the marines and the ninjas, who get the worst. The reason is thin, a nutcase cryptozoolog by the name of Dr. Pe√±a traps Chupacabra. He smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it go. You can make your treasures and watch this movie and not miss a battle. The most notable part that really makes it all worth it is about the captains' daughter. Towards the end she goes all the martial arts on the monster and kicks her ass. Let me get it right, the wizard wipes the entire umbilical seal unit while using ARMOR PIERCING ammunition !! OK, it's a movie that can happen right? But here comes the captain's daughter, who can't be older than 19, and kicks the crap out of chupacabra with front and side kicks. It was fun. They have to get a medal to come up with it.
