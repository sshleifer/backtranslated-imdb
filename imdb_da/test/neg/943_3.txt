Let me start by saying that there really is no need to watch this movie. I just sat through it because I was trying to kill some time before I started. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's your typical sophomoric "comedy" aimed at the teenage set. There is nothing remarkable about anything other than the complete ridicule of history, not to mention that there are plott holes that are large enough to sail through a Carnival cruise liner. Of course, it's not supposed to be a realistic movie, it should be fun. Unfortunately, it mostly fails too. I have to admit that I laughed a few times, but mostly in a "sacred treasure", I can't believe how stupid this is "kind. <br /> <br /> If you never see this movie, don't miss something again.
