sdiner82 had obviously not seen the movie for decades and his memory is appalling. His attempt to paint the Mark Lester shaving scene as suspect is completely erroneous, just like his incorrect comments about the bad guy "sneaking on the baby's body". Lester is dressed all the time, the man is in the room, and the man gives him a look. <br /> <br /> The scene is a rough attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about man's body. <Br /> <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's badly done, but no more. Even sdiner82's comments about Savala's character, which "randomly sent a German family to their deaths by nudging their trailer from a cliff" are nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead and she was in a car). I suggest sdiner82's review says far, far more about his own, far from liberal thinking than it does about this worthless film. The only reason I even bothered to look it up was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after Kojak. <br /> <br /> The movie is a worthless piece of 70's trash can, but sdiner82's review of it is the worst kind of fake. He encloses his review in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is pretty wrong on almost all "facts" he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he was looking for, which is disturbing. Now he can return to burning copies of Catcher in Rye.
