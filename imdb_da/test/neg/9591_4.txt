A potentially good idea is completely let down by a weak manuscript that throws out all credibility out of the window, leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it as well as he can by all mouth; Hurt has as much threat as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can't seem to decide if he plays an ex-London crook or some toff right out of the playing fields at Eton. With regard to poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than all Northern European ideas of the stereotypical Latin woman who are all pouts and hot temperament. If you're a fan of any of the major actors, don't disappoint or fool yourself (which I suspect many of the other reviewers have done here). See it in every way, but be critical; You know these guys can do better.
