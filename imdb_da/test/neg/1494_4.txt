An annoying group of ex-students from Monte Alto International High School decides to spend one night in the now abandoned institution where a "mystery kitten" is called the guard played by horror legend Paul Naschy, murdering them one by one. "School Killer" contains some references to such teenage clips such as "Scream" or "Friday the 13th". The climate twist ending resembles lilted from "The Sixth Sense". The uncertainty as to whether the homicide watchman is alive or dead gives a bit of mild interest, but the characters are one-dimensional, and the endless scenes of going through dark school corridors have really got on my nerves. The presence of charismatic Paul Naschy almost saves this clich√©d slasher flick. There is also something decent to do on the screen, including a nice bloody shelf. It's great to see Manuela Velasco of "Rec" fame in a small role.4 out of 10.
