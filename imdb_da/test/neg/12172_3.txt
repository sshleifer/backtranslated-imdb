Terrible. I hope I can save two hours in your life by warning you of this. I just finished watching the movie, BTW. <br /> <br /> I love good cross-hair films. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, I'll see them all. But you can't just throw epigrammatic quips into a rambling, camp, schlock-horror party and draw my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical movies. This is not one of them. Anyone who is amazed at the depth of intellect plumbed in this movie has not read a good book lately. Or ever. The "thought-provoking" dialogue is at best. Maybe it lost something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I love a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Laugh! I thought I would never start! Squirm? Only when you are trying to think politely to put my feedback on the movie to the friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is unnoticed in the setting of this movie, but even he can't revive it. I only wish he had shot the director instead of the zombies. Too shame that the country that gave rise to The Inferno should also give rise to this. Dante would spin in her grave.
