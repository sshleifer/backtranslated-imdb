It is quite rare for a movie to come together that is so useless that with IMDb I allowed the use of negative scores. In fact, I reflect on this movie, and I really can't think of a movie that had so little to do with it. Acting: Your fun right. Direction: No. A plot: No. This movie has nothing to do with it if you take it as a serious movie, it is often the case with movies of this genre, but most movies of this kind may look like they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the signs and situations are and almost get your times worth it. This movie is so empty that it can't even fit that purpose. I'll give this a -1/10, three points lower than any other movie I've ever judged. I really feel that the employees involved in this movie have to pay me for the 83 minutes I used to see it. I don't really have the words to describe how bad this is. No one should ever see it here for some reason.
