"I suppose you are here for damage to your mental circuit." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson made me see this ... he mentioned it in his book, "Movie Megacheese." I asked myself, "Why did Mike Nelson wrong me?" I now know why the robots never trust Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is by John Williams, who is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol 'Slewfoot, or is now damned, from the CEO down to the guy who drove the caterpillar outside the studio. Don't look at ... for God's love ... don't look !!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will curse you ... I'm doomed now, I understand this. I accept this. But save yourself ...
