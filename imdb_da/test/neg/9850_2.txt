This is one of rarities in movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should see it with a bottle of vodka. To be honest, we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink us stupidly for this movie. The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have omitted both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaboration efforts revealed the passion of the two actors, plastic bulbs with passion. There are also beetles banging. As violet would have said: "This (plastic film) goes up in your butt". The rat porn and subsequent rat crushing are fantastic. <br /> <br /> Okay. So, if you still read, let's explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of her students who, after completing a film class with her, decided to get poop-faced and see here direct debut. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can't tell you how much has been hammered into our skulls. So this movie is quite the experience. The whole bottom of this post becomes a drinking game we created for this movie. <br /> <br /> About 13 minutes in this game, none of us could see straight. The large amount of Dido in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant. There was something secretly pleasing to see two underground girls hit on a Kurt Cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, saving for its mysterious scene in the grocery store where he obviously read a local newspaper. Because that's what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were lovely derivatives of Lolita. And something about the provocative scene of the naked chin-up boy suggests the director's story of gay pornographic experiments. We want us to be fun. <br /> <br /> Enough intellectual consideration. FOR THE DRINKING! This ensures that the viewing experience is positive. It is very simple and very likely to care at least one member of your party. <br /> <br /> Mo Ogrodnik / Ripe Drinking Game: 1. Every time you see something related to pornography, you need to have a drink. 2. Every time you see the auteur Mo Ogrodnik name appear, grab a drink. 3. Sex. 4. (Plastic Peen) requires two drinks. 5. When a person points to a gun at another sign, take a drink. - At this point you will probably have to refill / piss throw any remaining newborn from your body. - 6. Every time there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), please take a sip! 7. The under-utilized hula-hoop girl requires a drink per day. Second. 8. Gratuitous use of the "magic black man" requires a drink. 9. If you can't figure out the line, keep DRINK, Beyotch. 10. When you can predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /> <br /> That's it, internet! Keep drinking and try not to mature. <br /> <br /> -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
