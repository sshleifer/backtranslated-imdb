I have very few to add to what all the other reviewers have already done more than clear! This movie is horrible! In addition to terrible ... In fact, so inappropriate that they have not yet been given an expression to describe the awful "Skeleton Man". If you expect your movies to have a minimum of logic and plot, you must stay as far away from this as humanly possible. Of course, lots of people are killed by this skeleton doll wearing a ridiculous robe, but no one ever has trouble explaining what he is, where he comes from or why he is so angry with the world. He looks like a crossover between Skeletor from "Masters of the Universe" and the rider from "Sleepy Hollow" and runs amok in some tried-and-tested deserts. The setting of "Skeleton Man" is another totally retarded aspect! For almost half an hour, I assumed that the movie took place on a small isolated island, but it simply plays on the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power stations are located at the end of the forest! Huh? Why does everyone pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes? Anyway, after a couple of random killings, a special command group, led by badly rinsed Michael Rooker, comes to come and hunt a monster they don't know about. Really fun is how each member of this group introduces themselves as an expert in a particular area (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, an exercise instructor ...), but they ALL die before any of them are able to Demonstrate their supposed masterful skills! The god of fear must really hate Casper Van Dien, whom he is also present again, showing a heroic soldier stealing a truck without apparent cause crashing on the highway but somehow being catapulted back to the middle of the forest for to die there. Right, it makes sense ... In addition, star steals cool lines from the "Predator", the bone head's horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are brought down by bow and arrows, ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely meaningless Vietnam flashbacks haunt Michael Rooker. I say we all combine forces and voices with this pathetic flick in the IMDb bottom top 100 ASAP!
