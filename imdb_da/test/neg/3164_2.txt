This movie looks great and it's about where my praise ends. "Love is a lot of exciting things" came out in the very schizophrenic in 1955, when lascivious nonsense like this coexisted with a bursting artistic fair like "Kiss Me Deadly". As a trend towards less socially conscious films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" established in the mid-50s, other directors felt that it was necessary to hold onto the incredible pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade, and "Love" is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of 50 movie where Technicolor is used to the extreme and the lighting is always high key; even scenes take place in a dark room or at night is brighter than the average sunny day. I will never hear the theme song again, as it is often played enough during the movie to keep someone in life, and I certainly will not hear the song of the sharp, perverted chorus that belts it out at the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really anyone could have played these parts. Jones's role is terribly written - her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that when her character is bound to decide something, the writers change a coin to determine what that decision would be. <br /> <br /> People will undoubtedly tell me that I'm taking this movie seriously, I'm unromantic, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Allows" released that year and like cornball in its own way except that Douglas Sirk can make the melodrama an art form, while Henry King ("Love" director) is not. <br /> <br /> I usually enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I just bored. <br /> <br /> Degree: D +
