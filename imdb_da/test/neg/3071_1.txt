who reads these remarks may think we might have a good movie in hand. I am Portuguese and I am ashamed that this film became a blast in Portugal. It can't really call this cinema. The direction and "mise-a-scene" are basic (even Ron Howard does it better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a really bad Tarantino); The cast is covered by television stars, models and reality show stars, which is nothing to do with acting. When you put a movie in these ingredients of course, fans of this kind of TV show will all watch. I am also surprised that people commenting on this in IMDb say this movie is a masterpiece. I thought this site was only for people who really like cinema and understand a bit of it. All the blockbusters made in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always horrible. If you think this movie is reasonable, then don't let your love movie and cinema say.
