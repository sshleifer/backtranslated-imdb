There is a good story well hidden and never really used! <br /> <br /> The movie is short and too dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and history development have been forgotten. What is left is muddled and shallow. Turn off your brain and see? You will probably find that time is fast enough, but unless you are the kind of person who finds soap deep and meaningful, you will not get any real satisfaction from this movie. Just watch if you have nothing better to do and only if someone else pays for the video rental.
