This film is an abomination of everything worthy of filmmaking. The main actor surprises his audience by not acting at all. We have to see almost two hours of his bland fun face. The Witnesses Are All Lame I never laughed when it was Saturday night, there were 5 of us who had a beer up for a laugh and then we put it on and you could feel all the warmth and color that was drained from the room. The movie ended and the atmosphere was ruined, so we went all our separate ways, ruined the night! OK so the pros and cons. Benefit from beautiful surroundings in Hawaii, look good on bluray. Disadvantages worst age; You can tell everyone concerned, just thinking about payday. Predictably poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes falling flat. Many shots of the boy's penis, which are fair, work better than him and have more charisma. May all makers of this movie hang their heads in shame and keep their slack men cheap.
