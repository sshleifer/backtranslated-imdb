Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my world class, our teacher had to see this movie and Amadeus to compare the two composers or something. We saw Amadeus first and it was a very good movie, but when she made us watch this movie directly after that, I couldn't believe what I saw. The actors were horrible, the costumes were ugly (the little boy was especially ugly and horrible), and the cinematography was z-grade. My friend compared it to a home video without the date in the lower right corner. I understand that this was a T.V. movie from Canada and probably cost $ 10 to do, but thank you, they could have done better. I've seen a couple of good T.V. movies in my time, but it wasn't one of them. The biggest thing I don't understand is why my world class couldn't just see immortal loved ones or anything. How is it possible to compare composers when they get the movie Amadeus, Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs, for Beethovan? It is not possible to do this when this is the choice of movie for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares about knowing but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10).
