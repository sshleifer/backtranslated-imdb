Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What time was it? I would say the Book of Life was when things really started to go downhill, but I would say he at least went uphill from this one. A movie that looks as if it was filmed on a person's mobile phone does not have to be a bad thing if it is distinguished by an interesting story and dialogue, but unfortunately they are missing with Hartley's extraordinary dialogue. In their place, boring exhibition on the themes of Christian end times and a thin story of a modern Jesus in a companion, are packed in a modern world, looking like a person from a Hal Hartley movie. While it fetches slightly in its other half, it is never fun or particularly sensible. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
