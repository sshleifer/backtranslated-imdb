The 1950's Rudolph Mat√©'s film has been revolutionized for the 80s, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university teacher who used to have a successful writing career, but it has now collapsed with his marriage. The original exhibition plans the idea in viewers that everyone has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not so surprised unless of course you are familiar with the original. Dexter, after being told he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to track his steps with one of his students Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they find that they have many obstacles in their path. <br /> <br /> The movie begins promising in black and white as Dexter stays in the rain against the local police station where he wants to report a murder ... his own but Huey Lewis style 80's battle that accompanies this scene , serves only to remove any sense of excitement and tells the viewer that this will be pretty bad, it's just a matter of how bad? Probably we will soon use the old flashback medium, but now the movie goes to the entire Technicolor. There is some short tribute to Noir as it embraces couples standing in front of a blinds, but there's really nothing here to recommend it, the show is horrible, especially Ryan makes his usual faint blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unnecessary ooomph into an already fine movie award, of course trying to cash in a Body Heat audience, the apparent results are undoubtedly aimed at a teenager and certainly, they are welcome to it. 4.10
