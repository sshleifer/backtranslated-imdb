Begin with Fulci playing a version of himself and writing down some ideas on how people could die. Followed by a fake-looking cat eats what is probably a brain. The copy I looked at was dubbed in English, which I always hate, but I was particularly disappointed that I couldn't hear Fulci in his own voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci is in a kind of feverish state working on his latest horror movie. His stomach turns when he sees things resembling effects from his film, and he begins to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him, and unfortunately he does not have his improved mental health in mind. I was reminded of the psychologist David Cronenberg played in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The shrinkage in this one is played by David L. Thompson, who is rather poor. Probably a spouse for Fulci, he has a great toothy laugh when he kills people, although this can be Fulci's black humor at work, which I thought was also quite poor. <br /> <br /> The movie is made up of a lot of clips from Fulci's movies, either as if Fulci is on the set, directing them, watching television, or witnessing the actions. I've never been too much of a fan of clip shows in TV shows, and I also think things like Charles Bands Full Moon Entertainment cut down their old movies and put three such cuts together as new anthologies are pretty paralyzed. I suppose they should make money? <br /> <br /> The shrinkage in Cat in the Brain refers to the theory that violence in film commits violence in real life. One of Fulci's colleagues is talking about having a documentary book holding Fulci to see how his life is. Lots of self-reflecting things like this. <br /> <br /> Finally, some people sail away on a boat called "Perversion".
