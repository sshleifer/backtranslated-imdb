I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul that I considered to be the best movie about rock n 'roll along with being the best teen girl I've ever seen. The first film was the career of George Lucas, who would later make the magnificent epic "Star Wars" before making prequels two decades later, while Richard Dreyfuss became a star in Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other films. </ a> <br /> Somehow without the two, the magic died. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows the audience what happened to the rest of the characters later in the sixties, when Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) protest against the Vietnam War while their friend Terry "The The Toad fields (Charles Martin Smith) themselves are in the war and are trying to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still the fast driver in California, where he never really left home. The rest of the supporting actors in the movie from Candy Clark's Debbie (Terry's boyfriend), Pharaoh's band members, along with Harrison Ford and others really do not do much. The original film showed that teens drove on the streets without bloodshed with the early music of rock music from Buddy Holly, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and Comets, Buddy Knox and more that brought the nostalgia's bug into classical music. The soundtrack for "More American Graffiti" is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music, and what even voted in the late 60s by protests, drugs, victims and more. <br /> <br /> Having seen "More American Graffiti" it seemed that it wanted to show audience members what happened after the epilogue of the four main characters of the first movie (except Dreyfus character ), where it was not necessary. This movie was also not necessary when I was happy to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss went on to bigger and better projects.
