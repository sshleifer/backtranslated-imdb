I really loved the Millennium series, starred by Lance Henriksen, why I bought the movie. Of course, it was a mistake at some level. Mutant / monster films are usually very poor and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea in itself is not entirely failing to fail (yet this movie would never have been successful, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out is just a B-class movie. The scenes, which must be scary, seem more fun to me, and the critter is not credible at all. <br /> <br /> But watching this movie with a group of friends in a restless mood makes this movie shine as it is unintentionally fun.
