IMDb lists this movie as a comedy. I have no idea what genre this movie falls into, but it certainly isn't comedy. tragedy maybe. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say whether this is a good movie or not. All I know is not a comedy. I wanted a laugh tonight and what I got was something bizarre perception of a person's affiliation with some ugly chairs. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what is advertised. It's movie school tripe that I can only assume is meant to "make people think". I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know or even I don't know. It's ridiculous drive that doesn't make sense anyway. <br /> <br /> It made me think okay. It made me think, "I wish I had the ninety minutes of my life back." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bend on their worldview that will make this movie worth looking at them. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
