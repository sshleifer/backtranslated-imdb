Some movies are just silly without explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot justify woodworking, the stupid plotline and the eternally predictable result. About the only thing that makes this movie halfway worth watching, are the badly dressed women (and the stupid guy for you ladies) in it. The head of the warrior women and Valeria are quite appealing to the eye. But it's all about this whole movie going to it. <br /> <br /> Some silliness in points: A scene when they begin to travel to the Dark One, they go away from a supposedly destroyed land. But we clearly see a 1980s New York behind them. Ca. 2 / 3rds of this movie looks like it was filmed in a high school basement. The deadly socks look so scary as a sesame street monster. I agree with Latronic that many 1950's trash b-movies did a better job than this. About the only thing I can think of was not teenagers from outer space.
