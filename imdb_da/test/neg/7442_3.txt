Unfortunately, manufacturers do not know when to rely on enough alone or are in recycling to the point that every scrap of waste generated by Hollywood is up to the Alpo. It seems that every sci-fi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of follow-up movies, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, under the direction of Paul Verhov, was a wild and stylish trip, even finding time for a small social comment on what the dark side of biotechnology is capable of making us. This movie has none of it, except perhaps telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you would regret when you are sober. Robocop 2 lacks the vision, the deeply scary vision of what we become, and instead takes us clumsy on a boat trip in how nurses and their victims really are. Social comments are damned. This really got the big one for me. If you don't care about anything other than SFX, go to it, my friend. Otherwise, you will not waste your time with this yeast-free sour cake and keep the first film's accurately measured, heavily weighted pumpnickle hot from the oven. It's so simple.
