This is a little less disease than the first two movies, but otherwise it is as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of sick cinema. Charles Bronson is back, blowing in action when his friend is killed by yobs who terrorize the neighborhood. The crime you see is up 11% in the South Belmont area ... so what needs to be done? A stronger police presence? Tougher prisons? Harder phrases? No, the only solution is to send a loose cannon like Bronson to meet bloodthirsty revenge? or as the authors wanted it to be justice: this time he is chief of police chief Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> The authors bend backwards to make the Kersey hero and send the useless police to the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it safe and provides a scene where Kersey has his camera Stolen and shoots the thief just behind to applaud it from the crowd. Death penalty for theft? Well okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters to digits that exist only to raise Kersey on or behind him is terrible. Of course, these crooks are scum, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to do themselves instead of cutting the whole thing against Kersey and his thoughtless answer? Found enough, the besieged residents are not afraid of retribution recovery or blame Kersey for any of the violence, which is odd as a sign is killed just because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, they take all the guns from their sockets and look forward to the massacre, and never stop thinking or struggling with the idea of ​​killing another human being. <br /> <br /> Malicious superficial notions do not help? Bronson has literally a facial expression all the time and can't even bend the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here ?? a machine gun? A rocket launcher?! ?? and new lodges of misogyny: The film commits to deciphering every female character in sight, either by rape, explosion or neck cutting; and it sets them up in a very stupid way, as a victim who wakes up in the criminally-ridden, re-directed neighborhood to ask a stranger or someone who is acting alone at night. This is boy, clean and simple, mindless waste put together without style or sense.
