Drilling, ridicule and stupid "Submerged" are a waste of time. Shootouts were a joke, real people just do not go out into the open without any cover, hoping to be shot first! So many things are wrong or bad, it's not worth inserting, except for a big mistake. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of L.A. and the water is 100ft deep ??? Even then, none of the population would have survived the decompression from being exposed to 100ft water pressure for more than 20 hours when they were brought up. Just a horrible one.
