I don't understand how this waste came on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie! It was incredible that I and a group of friends decided to watch this one night, and it was just the stupidest thing anyone of us had ever seen, I couldn't believe it! We saw the first 15 minutes in complete awe that someone actually thought about this and then made it into a movie. Are they on the crack? My guess is yes in large doses. I doubt very much that anyone ever likes this garbage can. Should this be sci-fi or comedy or what? I don't do the idiots who did it carefully, they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many suckers they could fool to see it. Now we put something on film so let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf - no no no. This is not film making. The action is like watching wooden dolls move around and read from a book, it's so bad it is. I want to go to the movie store and complain and get my money back, no one should endure this crap. So I'm here to warn you - DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it's the stupid thing you've never seen!
