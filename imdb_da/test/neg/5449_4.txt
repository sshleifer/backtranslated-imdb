Congo is another multi-million dollar adjustment of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film raped the book about its true meaning and essence. I will make this card and to that point. The landscape is beautiful. The actors, yes it is the best they can do. The script? Try overloading hundreds of pages in an hour and a half movies. You get a mess in the end, but how cheating a mess is what counts and Congo falls somewhere below it. There were some stupid moments, just as why did the killer decide the gorillas to jump into the lava? And Amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, yet can scare dozens of killer monkeys around her? What kind of common sense is it? Which brings me to this. If there was an annoying character in each movie, Amy ranks one here. You see Amy is this naive little female monkey who can talk to a special backpack and harness attached to her. Real idea, but it gets annoying after a while to hear her talk. Congo is worth seeing and not regrettable, but certainly not a memorable movie either.
