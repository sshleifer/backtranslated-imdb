I just watched this movie on Bravo! and it was terrible. It has a plot of a Shannon Tweed movie with no nudity. The prerequisite was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. The signs were trite, as were the observations of human nature and greed. For a movie called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with other class differences than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. This movie could have done much better if there were more signs of motivation to get the ticket and was a "who did it?" The action wasn't amazing, but it's hard to be credible with such a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very sweet, and I want to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. She's probably the only reason I sat through the whole movie. <br /> <br />
