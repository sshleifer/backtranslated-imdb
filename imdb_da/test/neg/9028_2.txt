This movie is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has delivered many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them highlighted by strong and powerful performances by Spanish actor Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he also relies on a gifted actress, novice Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but it is hardly the only positive element in an otherwise horrible mess in a movie. While Lopez de Ayala is trying hard to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her beautiful man, it seems as if she was unable to develop her character over this one-dimensional function; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and politics at that time was crucial in her story ... but here she is introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera; It's a real shame and the movie is a lack of opportunity to show how personal life can affect history and vice versa. Worst of all, Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri show themselves in real bad performances, which in Liotti's case is a real problem as he portrays Felipe el Hermoso, a crucial role in this story. Attracting young audiences seems to be a clear choice as they both look like top models in this era. On the other hand, talented actors like Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are wasted in supporting roles that are clearly underdeveloped. Although this was a big budget movie, some care was taken by bringing a good manuscript or creating "period pieces" on the screen. Costumes are especially grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material without considering a real context. All in all, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and that's what makes the difference with far better historical movies like LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is that a director's point of view is lacking. This was a strange turn in Aranda's career when he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES come to me), which create very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA is really no more than a routine academic historical piece ... and a not very good one on it!
