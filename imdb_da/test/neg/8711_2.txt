The only reason I give another star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good representation of the story. I enjoy watching a few fictional characters added to add some color to a familiar story. But the other half was horrible !!! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the authors of this film chose only to include the violence and forget about the good things God did for the Israelites. Towards the end of the movie, Scott looked as if he had received messages from the great giant head instead of speaking and hearing from God. This reproduction had some major problems with deviation from the script. And great surprise, there are no favorable deviations! Their depiction of Moses as this screaming naked lunatic, who did all this against his will, is completely false. It showed a Moses who had to scream to make God speak to him. FAILURE Scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time and not just a mood print. They made the people complain correctly, but failed to show that God spoke to Moses in Sinai in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe. (Chapter 19). They also forgot the log fire and the cloud that guided them during the day and night. <br /> <br /> What was the whole Joshua case? The righteous peace-loving Jew who would not fight until Moses threatened him? Wrong (He was known as a great warrior) What about the great speech Moses gave to the army, telling them that God had helped them enough, and now they were alone? WRONG (They only won through God's help as shown in their own scenes with Moses lifting his staff) And what was sad to see the Ark of the Covenant? Instead of overlaying it with gold, this movie was on a tight budget and connected to small gold chips for it! Oh yes, it was a "melted calf", not a straw with small chips. Someone forgot that they came out of Egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the Egyptians. You wouldn't know from this upset cast. <br /> <br /> By the way, the part about those killing the Israelites after the golden calf event says "men" and does not mention women and children as the film pleased to show viewers. Oh yes - Manna was not the only one sent from heaven - don't forget the birds for meat. The Bible also mentions that Jethro brings Moses his wife and children and says that Jethro returned to his own land. It doesn't say Moses gave his family. <br /> <br /> If you don't know the real story, read Exodus for yourself. If you know the real story, you will hate this version.
