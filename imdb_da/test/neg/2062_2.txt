I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historic classics." It is hardly a classic, and as the plot was updated to the time of its release, neither is historical. The actual title of the DVD is "Indecent" and also the subtitle "Becky Sharp's Private Life." Myrna Loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is provided with a terrible script and a narrow dialogue. As with many early talkies, and especially those made by minor studies, there is little skill demonstrated by cast and crew. Loy wears a pair of dress that is pretty stylish, but her costumes and makeup in the later stages are exaggerated. The one saving grace is a tolerable performance by Billy Bevan, who plays one of her many suitors
