Welcome to Vikram Bhatt's world, the man who once was successful and got several hits with small actors like KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multi-master AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his one movie with Aamir GHULAM. <br /> <br /> A beautiful top of these movies is that everyone is Hollywood remakes and some decent ones the one who worked <br /> <br /> SPEED is a remake of CELLULAR and it's also terrible . <br /> <br /> A look at stars, we once salable but now out of work Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the flop Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others <br /> <br /> The movie may be a decent thriller, but many problems are there the storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like zayed hijacking a mobile company and many more and stunts are also ridiculous, while twists at last are too grinning the movie also took a long time to reach theaters that lose their spark <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible Music is outdated <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, makes faces.e What he always does, Urmila is good in his part, Sanjay Suri is not that compelling Ashish Chaudhary is trying hard in a negative role and he's okay. Aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role. Surprisingly, the same director gave him his only solo hit KASOOR Sophie is awful Tanushree is a non-actress
