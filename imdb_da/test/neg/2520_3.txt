I first heard about this movie when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his CD "Werewolves and Lollipops". He said it was a lost classic that is quite ridiculous. Being a lover of horrible cinema, I knew I was a treat. <br /> <br /> This film is, hands down, one of the strangest things I've ever seen. Definitely one of the strange shlock movies. Basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman the woman died or something, the demon wept blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now occupied and it now eats. Along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. The people can range between horny teenagers, mayors, gangsters, servants, or professional organ casters. There is also a sick guy where the bed ate, but put the soul behind a picture in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies allow you to find out the plot through exciting action. Death Bed takes a different path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what happens while slow, boring murder scenes take place. I also have to say that everyone who is eaten by the bed is surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed eats you through the ways of a fifth grade scientific experiment, it would stick a little. I suppose nerve endings were not invented until 1981 or so. <br /> <br /> The story is crazy, the direction is slow and pretty horrible, the sets are sparse, it seems quite painful, and the brother is one of the unintentional ugly actors I've ever seen. Probably would make a good film if alcohol and smart donkeys are involved. Certainly one you should not miss.
