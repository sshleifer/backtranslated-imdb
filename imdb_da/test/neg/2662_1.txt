Have you ever seen the movie "Marathon Man"? Part with the dentist? I'd rather have that for me than sitting through "Random Hearts" again. It was not only uninteresting or immaterial - it was terrible, painful and agonizing to wear. At one point, I lost immediate compassion. For the average layman, I might have seemed to be sleeping, but the other movie receivers consciously understood that I was actually BLACKED OUT from the table. I thought I should die. When the movie finally ended (I think it was twelve hours long, but I'm not sure), I got out with a pampered "Thank You Jesus, It's Over !!" which all other movie guests cheered. If I were to hear the Harrison Ford drone for another second in the monotone whine, I would have been forced to look for something sharp for paper jams in my eye to divert my attention. This is 136 minutes in my life, I will never come back.
