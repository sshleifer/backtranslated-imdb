worst. movie. ever made. EVER. I have no words to say about it ... otherwise since it really had no meaning, no plot, no ... anything. clean crap !!! I don't know how everyone in the movie shot them on the shelves after seeing it .... .... .... ... .. I love vampire flicks and mysteries and alternatively abstract outside the boxing movies, and ... This was not theirs. I mean what crap !!! I can't even tell you what the movie was about cuz I still don't know, and I just wasted an hour and a half of my life and looked at it ... the bottom line .. I think the producer of This movie just wants everyone to do drugs. That's all I got from this movie. please don't look at this ... I mean for a "sultry sensual vampire flick" there wasn't even the expected nudity you would get from a vamp flick. anyway back to my point .... this movie is blowing. fire yourself ... ... .. ..
