For a while I was hooked on shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and stuff, although I thought they were full of shacks, I found them interesting and entertaining, and so we see entertainment TV. It's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow trapped on the camera is not just a shadow, but an insidious spirit of asylum prison or something as long as you can snatch back to the real world later. Having said that, enjoying paranormal condition requires more than just shutting off your brain, it requires you to consume lead in large doses regularly during your childhood, so suffer repeated head trauma and then absorb huffing paint in your teens. Then you have to get high / drunk and see. Paranormal state is beyond the pseudoscience (which I can enjoy with a degree of critical thinking) that you find at Ghost Hunters (which I still find to be a reasonably interesting and entertaining program), it's pseudo ... everything. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of students from Penn State University (not confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell, whom they take on themselves to expel demons and spirits through ceremonies from which Religion at any time seems most dramatic at the time (ranging from Catholic exorcisms performed by college coeds to Wiccan magic cast by socially awkward goths to Indian purification rituals. Credit, these are performed by Indians). If you believe in Wicca, or you are a Catholic or a follower of a traditional Native American religion, I think you will have their purification rituals done by someone who is not a badly adapted college student in leisure time. I can't remember the scene in the exorcist, where the priests beat their hands and said, "It's not for nothing! Call a college high school college. This is too much for us. You've probably read Wikipedia article on exorcisms." The show is honest insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. The show's opening title sequence has spoken by Ryan about the PRS (Paranormal Research Society) and said that when he came to Penn State (note you don't see any shows where the host says the same, but instead of Penn State he says "When I came to MIT "or" After I got my theoretical physics degree ... "he found other people of similar interest to the paranormal. He says they are sometimes "warriors". I remember when I used to pretend to be a warrior and I fought with ghosts. I was six. Then, the numb Ryan brings out the flamboyant and unpleasant Chip Coffey, who pretends to be in trance and obsessed by cussing on casting. Fantastic. I thought people had learned something sensible about how ridiculous the idea of ​​psychics and medium is after "Crossing Over" went out of the air. The show goes far too seriously, as this small group of social misfits pretends to be fighting against some old cosmic evil. Production values ​​are low, stories are boring, and unlike Ghost Hunters, who in the meantime will catch something irregular (although likely to be explanatory but interesting) on ​​their equipment, PS requires you to believe that they sound and creak, hear, are signs of demons, ghouls and possibly leprechauns. The only scary thing about this show is that there are people out there who take it seriously. The only thing that is paranormal about it is that the people on it are able to make each episode while holding a straight face. Call me, but I feel like the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife is too big to be resolved on a half-hour television broadcast of a journalism undergrad at a state school. All I say, I strongly recommend that everyone see this show at least once if no other cause than pure entertainment comes from watching a truly horrible movie or TV show. Or you can make a drinking game out of it. I think the other would be preferable.
