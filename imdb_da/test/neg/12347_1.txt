A friend and I went to see this movie. We have opposite opinions about Fujimori, but after watching this movie we agree on the following: The easiest way to get an inaccurate documentary is to make it a foreign country where you were not present when the events happened, regardless how talented or how much you invest in the movie. If you are really seeking to learn about the history of another country, see something that has been done by native people in that country, otherwise you will not be able to step away from your bubble. And those who try to force their views and opinions on something they do not belong to, are abusing their power. To make it even worse, the director did not choose to talk about the CIA's embarrassing involvement with Fujimori's regime. She decides to evade dealing with the only issue for witch, which her country has much to explain to the Persians. But it is not surprising, because both the director and the CIA violate Peru's sovereignty by trying to influence the democratic processes at very different levels of course. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in helping Peru she would have funded a native to make the documentary. In any case, there are numerous Peruvian documentaries, films and books on the subject. Such include "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero", etc. The director of "Fall of Fujimori" should spend her time analyze the many problems in his own country or at least the inclusion of her country in relation to other nations.
