I've always been a fan of Bottom, grabbing as many videos as I could find out of the series here in the states. The chemistry between Rich and Ade is always genius, and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without errors. So I sat down to watch this movie with great zeal and ... was totally disappointed at the end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and badly directed (sorry, Ade!), but with some amazing moments. Unfortunately, these ridiculous events make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is. Slapstick starts fun, but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous. The end of the movie (the "green" scenes, for those of you who have seen it) was ... maybe the worst end I've seen in the last decade. Frankly speaking. It was a joke repeated about thirty times, followed by a sudden ending that had no meaning (which did not bother me) and was not fun (which did). In summary, I was very disappointed with this movie. I will cling to the glorious moments in it to preserve the greatest memories I can ... but I have to warn you if you are considering paying for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer, don't. There are far better things to spend on the money.
