The director is sweet, like his co-directing wife Shira Geffen, but their movie sucks. It has its moments (and some beautiful girls), but there is too much of it: "Am√©lie" meets "Breaking the waves" encounter "Pauline on the beach". You go away and want to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl who likes the best when nothing happens, be it in the movie or in reality. Instead, you get a suicide writer, a neurotic actress, and an illegal immigrant-coming-social-worker with a heart of gold. It feels as though there is more than one really moving story hidden in the manuscript, but at face value it is a truck of wasted stories and sentimental suffocation. Hard to sit as it is.
