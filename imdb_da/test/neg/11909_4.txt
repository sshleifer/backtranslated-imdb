The premise of the movie seems to be that the passage of 2. World War II generation in America, with its apple piefoniness and hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. The horrible hippies apparently destroyed everything. <br /> <br /> What keeps the movie together is the excellent performances - especially Lemmons, which are truly remarkable. Otherwise we have a boring slice-of-life drama (just over 24 hours Jack's life) with pretensions. I found it a task to sit through.
