This TV show may be the most pathetic display of crap on television today. Horribly predictable, indecent use of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. The way he chooses to make each episode a public service message is really annoying. His action seems so bad that it causes a person to shudder with embarrassment. I will give the series some credit though ... it will be entertaining at times, but not enough for it makes any difference. With all the negative points that this series has, I still prefer it over reality TV, it really can't be more worthless than that.
