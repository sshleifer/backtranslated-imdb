A root canal without anesthesia is more entertaining. This movie is disturbing and meaningless. There is absolutely nothing credible about any of these signs or the plot line. What in God's name did these people think when they agreed to star in this movie? The action in this movie is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty damned good. "The In-Laws" is a fun movie. "The Birdcage" is a fun movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous movie. This movie is just stupid. I can't even begin to grasp the kind of sick mind required to write the "short story" on which this movie is based. I honestly can't think of another good thing to say about this movie. It just makes no sense. People thanks - I ask for you - can't see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst ever made, but it is definitely up there at the top of the list.
