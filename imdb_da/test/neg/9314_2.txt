What can be said about this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras, and whether it was in the form of footage or budgetary constraints, does not make it easier to look at this variation on a theme by Romero. I was constantly reminded that I looked at a person's school project, at best derived, at worst, cheaply. <br /> <br /> Author / director Georg Koszulinski (also seen in the movie) does some interesting things with stock footage, but that says more about his editing style than his director style, which is made up of close-ups with television cameras that got I believe I saw public access television instead of a real movie with honesty. The story copies and paste pieces from various sources, including the previously mentioned Romero's DEAD trilogy, THE ROAD WARRIOR (dig the stock footage of a "future" similar to the past) and BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> What results are an hour-and-nothing worth the zombies are tracking and eating people. (Okay, "humans" in this case are clones, but it doesn't change anything. It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031 and the first string of people cloned nineteen years before has started to work, especially in the diet. Of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they taste is human flesh (or in this case cloned human flesh). It is not safe to be indoors, it is not safe to be outdoors. It's just a matter of time before the carnivorous ghouls devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I don't mind people ripping from Romero if it's done well, but there's no new area covered by this movie. It's the death-death meeting, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, shot with television cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the DVD deck makes it look like it was at least shot with 8mm film. This would not have been a problem with me if the story hadn't been as cheap. The film gives a deep view of the future, where technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. Should we continue to clone our favorite movie?
