What ever happened to shows with united parents' characters? The parents in this show are almost as irresponsible as the kids. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. They can never agree on an action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yes, good plan. Just ignore their behavior because they are "cute". This show tells the already manipulative preteens who see the "divide and conquer" technique as the best way to get their parents "cave". The eldest children are constantly running and sticking to all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yes, big tv okay.
