Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a steel factory in Pittsburgh who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent who is a communist to get information on party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the prostitute movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to fight with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school, who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eva learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives, the Reds decide that she should be wound up, and Cvetic should help her without threatening him. The film must have lots of excitement and double crossing, but there is very little in this movie, but (according to today's standards) very cheesy propaganda and little action or excitement. Lovejoy is very good in the lead, but even he and the rest of the cast seem resolved. Get surprises here and how did this movie get an Oscar note for best documentary? Rating, 4.
