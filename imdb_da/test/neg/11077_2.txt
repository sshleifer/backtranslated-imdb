I can't say if "The Cavern" is a ripoff of "The Cave" because I haven't seen it. I've seen "The Descent" and it's not terrible, but it's very hard to see, and it's also this. Hard to see, as in, there is very little light and lots of fast movements, so you are hard pressed to say what you are looking at. There are times when I think you should be scared, judging from the music, but afraid of what? Bad camera work? Bad lighting? If so, this should be the scary movie made. The story is that a bunch of cave researchers go to a hole in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and do their descent, but there are (of course) in there with them. And what is it? A guy says it's a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, just before being torn apart, but whatever it is, you can't see it. And just when you think (or hope) ends the movie as the screen gets dark for a little, you see the two remaining cavers (the two women) wake up somewhere in Betty and Wilma's attire and start trying to find their way out of where they is. They drink some water and start eating something until they find out what it is and start puking .... and then the mystery of what's in the cave and you're just amazed. Maybe maybe not. Stupidly stupid silly .... I think I'm pretty well done with hollow movies at this time, 2 out of 10.
