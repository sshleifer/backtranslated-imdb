Thank goodness, this has not been renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, while popular (God knows why) has a very simple - 'Look, I've found another body behind flowers / shrubs / trees / anywhere they work - in the sixteenth time this series' plot. The dialogue is so simple, it's like this is written for children - talk down to the viewer and explain each plot point. <br /> <br /> They're just 'happening' to be around when someone does something unusual - and no one knows them. <br /> <br /> Whenever they look at and investigate the murders of others, they get in the way of everyone else - rejecting the lives of all - including the completely innocent. <br /> <br /> They break in and go into people's homes, steal things, and proof (even firearms) are curious and come into people's lives, spying on them, and going through their stuff. They never apologize, never get caught or arrested (and if they do, they can talk about it, even if another person does the same thing in jail !!!). <br /> <br /> They always came up trumps. Now I know that this is an easy walk series, but I think it realistically should not have passed the first episodes! It is simply unrealistic. I think they have found enough body in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where they are every two weeks), so I hope it never comes back. <p> <p> br /> <br /> ITV would have some actions on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - "someone has been murdered on the village booth - again" type series.
