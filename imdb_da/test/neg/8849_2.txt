I can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and especially those where the subtitles are weak and don't really seem to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense. All in all, I can admit to a couple of scary and freaky parts, but they are repetitive, I felt I saw a loop trailer; Looks like it was a short movie shot with various actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE, but not even close to the hype ... killed the great length of tension. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies (which I thought I was), don't play your time on this one.
