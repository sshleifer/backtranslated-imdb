I watched this movie in Blockbuster and thought it might be a good Sunday night movie when there is nothing else to do. So I bought the used 3 DVDs for $ 25. Even though it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail driving through my foot. <br /> <br /> The movie started nicely. Kinda Dark and mysterious. I was always thrilled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first battle scene was pretty cool. I was thrilled with the rest of the movie. Then the film took a serious nose dive. <br /> <br /> I understand this was a big hit in the east. I guess because of the twins. However, I can't see it. This movie, except for the first 10 minutes, was horrible. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be fantastic and blow it terribly. This is just another accident. Jacki Han's role in this movie doesn't make any sense at all. Whyyyyyyyy? Complete dullness. He probably made some bucks of it himself. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing in this movie is the swords they use. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
