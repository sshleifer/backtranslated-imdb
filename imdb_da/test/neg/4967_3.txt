All the boys seem to be sexually raised by Mandy Lane. All the girls seem to be jealous of Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to be about it, and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and a magnet for every boy she meets, but we never learn Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts an invitation from his student friends to go to a secluded ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and fabric. In the film, the teenagers drink spirits like the water and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip. And there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, teens disappear one by one. But the others are all drunk and tall. No one, including those watching movies, cares or is worried at all. Nobody, including the audience, seems to be wrong. Emmet, a fellow student, is the initiator of the entire event. There is a security guard, Garth (dashingly and beautifully played by the Anson Mount), who guard and protect the ranch. Midway through the film, the killer is revealed, the excitement is suddenly released as air escapes from a balloon. The events are completely predictable and the movie is just totally fizzles out. Mandy meets her fight, but we never know why - and at the end of the movie there is still no sex. The hearts of the Mandy boys, or does she simply carry all the boys and girls to their death? This absolutely confused viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of female and male competition - by killing the manipulative girls and the unpleasant boys. Is Mandy Worth Watching? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to believe it, but this viewer does not. The talented film photographer (Darren Genet) gives some amazing pictures, but his focus actually seems to be on Garth, who is right stud. Not all boys love Mandy, or do they? If you want to get bored enough to find out how this movie blows up, my advice is to sleep halfway through movies until you see the temples of Mandy and Garth's rolling steps. But don't wait for something to happen. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy remains virgin and there is still no sex. I rank this movie a 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all the girls love Garth, and all voyeuristic eyes seem to be on Garth in a compromising position. But, unfortunately, girls and boys never seem to get beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a secluded ranch and no sexual ever happens. The audience is led to horror on a ranch - and can't help but ask why?
