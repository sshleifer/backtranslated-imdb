Yes, I did it all the way to the end. However, it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director on the set. The play ... Well, I don't even know what to say. I thought the girl who played Emily tried her best with the boring, sometimes crazy and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know it was low budget, but the hollow sound and lighting made it clear and sounds like a 100 minute audition tape. <br /> <br /> I'm not even talking about the end ... The best thing about the movie was the music. <br /> <br /> Being said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch together, it's not something to waste your time on. If you're looking for a sad lesbian theme movie, check out The Children's Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. They will all leave you depressed and gloomy, but you will not have to suffer film discovery in the process.
