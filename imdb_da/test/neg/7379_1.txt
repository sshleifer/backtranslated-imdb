As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to hold my head in a bucket of lion, pull my eyes out and jump out of a rock." This summarizes my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort. Artless, self-indulgent, thoughtless and just bad. Poorly beyond understanding. What more can I say? If you're unlucky enough to be in an area where this piece of idiotic rubbish plays, please be merciful and avoid at all costs.
