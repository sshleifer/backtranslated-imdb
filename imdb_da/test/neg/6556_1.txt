Especially if you love horrible movies. When I first saw it, I could only say "I hope there is a dance sequence in it." Imagine my joy when not ONLY danced the two main characters, but the main ghost also began to break dance. And to top it off, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance dance (not to mention the theme song). It makes me a little sad that he broke down because of this movie, but I never wanted him as an actor and he should really have known better. Not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other movies he directed!). A warning, even though the author seemed to like jokes about, um, male lower regions. For example, one of the characters discovers a book called "Groins of the Darker Species." I'm not kidding. And that's for me the most disturbing part of the movie. Otherwise, you'll find the most unclear video rental store in your city, get the movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
