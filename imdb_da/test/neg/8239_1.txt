As I sat watching this episode, I continued to look at the clock and wait for something to happen. When the hour went down, I thought they would really give us a big pop at the end, and then - nothing. The whole family is huddled around the Christmas tree as something from the Hallmark Channel, so fade to black. Perhaps one of the poorest seasonal finals I've ever seen. Nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season. The only thing that was cast out as a kind of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while pawed a sub sandwich that the boys in New York were trying to get one of the boys in New Jersey. Wow really? I would never expect any of it from mobsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> It seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest. They begin several plot lines that end just disappear than any show I've ever seen. They tease and hint, but rarely live anymore. <br /> <br /> What's with the Arabs hanging on Bing? They continue to throw them in front of us and magically, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie snaps a kid after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to his son and poof, gone in the wind. /> <br /> And how many more changing drug assemblies with Christopher should we endure? Please get him arrested or overdosed or something interesting. <br /> <br /> This was one of the few shows I used to watch, but now it is forgotten.
