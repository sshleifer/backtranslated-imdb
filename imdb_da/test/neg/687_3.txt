I have so much testosterone as the next ink, and Raquel Welch at her finest is definitely worth a visit; But the fact is that a cardboard cutter can work better, and an hour and a half by Mrs W, showing her big assets, doesn't make a movie. <br /> <br /> Considering the cast, it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy Harry is as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to sleep through their lines; and as for Edward G ... yes, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck. <br /> <br /> This movie is a mess: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. If it wasn't for Miss Welch, I'd have given it a 0. <br /> <br /> That being said, she's a treat for the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in "Bedazzled" - and for The only reason alone I gave it a 3.
