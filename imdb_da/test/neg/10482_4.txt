Okay, when I bought this flick, I must be the ultimate b-movie, the space-cat landing on Earth and starting to kill people right away! <br /> <br /> Now, it was almost everything I expected, typically low budget scifi movies from the 60s. Action must be the worst I have ever seen, especially the girl plays the lead and the girl who played the waitress made me laugh my ass out. <br /> <br /> So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall into the 'so bad it's good' category? The reason why some of the scenes were just too long and boring. For example, there were police officers seeking traces in the forest, it was only a few minutes' walk without purpose. And then the grand final, the people are waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the room monkey looks, it gets wack'd in 20 seconds, the end of the movie. Yes, 'Night Fright' is boring, but it did have some fun moments. I can recommend this movie to anyone who liked movies like 'Zontar, Thing from Venus' or 'Curse of the Swamp Creature'. <br /> <br /> I give 'Night Fright' 4 Space Monkey slaps out of 10.. <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
