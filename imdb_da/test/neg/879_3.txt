Here in Australia Nights in Rodanthe are promoted in the same class as Notebook. Frankly, how much mess. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is usually perfect in this genre, Diane Lane an old favorite from "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful", the sea side location, loneliness and yet sucks the movie. At the meeting we went to yesterday afternoon a woman next to my wife fell asleep and halfway through the movie came up and went! The biggest problem is that there is no structure or credibility to the relationship in the first place. And maybe there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like stories that Gere and Lane's characters bring to the movie. There are hours of them balanced with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There is no heat from Geres character, Lane looks awful at the start of the movie and everyone is washed out. So, as the viewer, we can't really connect the characters. <br /> <br /> Others say the book is amazing. Well that's the manuscript, direction or production someone here has made a real root in this movie. It's like the scenes and structure are a short card, except instead of being in the right order, they have just been thrown together everywhere. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save your money when it hits the video stores and even expect a good deal when it comes to the weekly rate.
