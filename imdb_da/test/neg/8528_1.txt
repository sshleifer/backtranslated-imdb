This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the dissatisfaction with sitting through. After the introduction, where we get the background for "something" to kill a few people in a farmhouse, we are introduced to a white, looser family moving to a farm - and nothing is hanging out for a looooong time. Then they meet this drive, which helps out in the yard and nothing hangs for a very long time. Then, FINALLY, the girl in the family has some plural geistic things. Then there are more, drives the guy has to go and the movie ends. In between everything about how this family had to move out, the girl got into trouble at home, and they have no money and it has been made so weak that I could do less about these pathetic people. I can't believe I actually went to the theaters to see this! Not only did this movie, but some a $$ hole replied to its cell phone, stupid morons made noise and the movie sucked. WHERE THEATER SUCKS - Bad movies, expensive food and idiots in the theater, I am at home watching DVDs from now on, at least I could smoke if I was at home while watching this silly movie. Stay home and bake a little pie instead of going to a theater to see this piece of typical crap. Stupid stupid crap.
