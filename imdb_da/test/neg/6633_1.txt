Bad movie! Bath! Go in a discount container. Carrot Top really needs to stick to low-lighted comedy clubs. It's movies like this that make old Jerry Lewis movies look like Shakespeare and John Agar as John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a fine talent) is absolutely wasted. Her purpose seems primarily to look neat and ignorant. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining thing about the movie is to watch Raquel Welch make an Alexis Carrington-type role, and Estelle Harris as a harridan of a hostess. The only way I can imagine that someone thinks it would be a good idea to make this (besides sophomoric) movie is if the producer's fourth grade child was allowed to choose the script. Well, maybe his third degree. What this movie really needs is to rub in the noses of its creators.
