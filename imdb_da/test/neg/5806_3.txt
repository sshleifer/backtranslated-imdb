What could be expected from any Adam Sandler-produced comedy, grandmother's boy is predictable and so stupid it's disease. Allen Covert stars as Alex in the movie, a 35-year-old pothead who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandmother and her two roommates after losing her apartment. There are some common plot variants: he has trouble adjusting to his new life situation, which in turn makes him in trouble at work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to stitch one of the office's new consultants. Throw a weird boss, almost an alien star, a real nerdy best friend, a couple of scenes in widespread potty place, a really big party scene and an original video game Alex is trying to finish himself in the mix you have Grandma's boy in full. Allen Covert makes a marginally good management, Linda Cardellini is sweet enough for her role as adversarial consultant Samantha, and a few scenes manage to squirt a chuckle or two, but none of that makes Grandma's boy worth much of any time. Most of the supposedly funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them is nothing more than "humor" that would make anyone on National Lampoon's embarrassed to see, Joel Moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video games mastermind In fact, JP and the whole movie do manage to be boring on top of not fun or essential. Well, at least Grandma's Boy did something for anyone: Adam Sandler was able to get a few pay slips for his out-of-work friends, David Spade, Kevin Nealon, and Rob Schneider.
