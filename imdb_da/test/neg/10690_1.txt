My friends and I watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. in the beginning it was tolerable. it stank of BAD IMPROV, but it was pretty friggin fun, though the scenes were too long and pulled out and the terrible quality (I read $ 400 budget over ... sounds right) of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem stems from the lack of a script; With a background in improv, I know how difficult it can be to keep scenes short and effective. What happened in this movie was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes, and they didn't know when to stop, they just kept stupid for years. At first I thought it was because the movie was short and they needed long, useless scenes to mash it out. As the film progressed, I realized that it was just a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I could see that the filmmaker had a really good idea for a shot, but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it out effectively. Many scenes were taken from a single shot (because you know, improv) for what felt like a really long time. so boring! If you can stand up to an hour and a half for horrible improvisation, see it. It's really fun on parts but also really silly and annoying. the play ranges from utterly horrible. It looked like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the fussy child who swore lots, barbershop etc etc <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad. just as I was literally hurt. after an hour my friends and I were just bored and left.
