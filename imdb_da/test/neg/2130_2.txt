This cheapo exploitation flick is some really creepy thing, courtesy of spaghetti country director Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name from this unwanted. The basic core of this excursion concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washed up on the Caribbean coast. Authorities initially believe they are the victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation is lifted, it turns out to be something much more eerie. All of this is ultimately very small, but we have here - bad duplication complimented by similar weak writings, which often consist of indecent jabbering, and are mostly of little importance for the most part. Action can only be described as underpairs, which is par for the course in this case. Really salmon direction doesn't help either. <br /> <br /> Particular effects are mainly for many close-ups of various gory bodies lacking limbs and so on. Of course, there is the obligatory being that regularly appears at feeding time, which resembles a large monster squid, where its animation consists only of its pointed teeth rising and falling in rhythmic articulation. All in all, the end result is not too convincing, but it is almost entertaining in a cheesy way. <br /> <br /> It seems that the filmmakers went on was a kind of low hybrid hybrid of Jaws and Piranha, but the final product is just a bloody shambles, like the similarities incessantly shown throughout this image. I find it hard to think of any redeeming attributes to justify seeing this, so it is strictly for incurable monster film users.
