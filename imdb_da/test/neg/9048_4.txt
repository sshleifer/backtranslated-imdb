"Eat Alive" goes much easier than Ruggero Deodato's "Cannibal Holocaust", but it is also a far more sillier movie. I mean, it can sometimes be unintentionally fun, but the plot is so numbly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience at the end. Tough Guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) is joining Janet Agren (Gates of Hell, here with an unacceptable accent) to search New Guinea's Jungle for Agren's sister, who has been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov ). Along the way, they witness (sometimes genuine) animal torture and some creepy cannibalism. As described by Umberto Lenzi, the movie is over-top, it's hard to take seriously, but if you enjoy the trash with more than a few unintentional laughs, it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
