Seriously, I can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it in itself writing the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines were Bogdonovitch during the film of this movie? Would he give a bonus to the actor who spit out his lines with the fastest and least bending or thinking? The dialogue is bad, plagued terribly, even for a "screwball" comedy, claiming that the film is a tribute to classical movie comedy, about the most horrible thing I've ever heard. The cinematography is under the quality and innovation of it exhibited by the worst television films, but the play is terrible (although I get the feeling that the error for it is right in the lap director), I have mentioned that the direction is so random and uncontrollable that it attacks the definition of the word? It's all a terribly unfunny (even in the very besieged world of so bad-it's fun clunkers), soul sucking, wasting two hours of life you never come back. Be scared, be very scared ...
