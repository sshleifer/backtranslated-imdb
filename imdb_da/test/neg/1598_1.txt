I can usually tolerate twisted films, but this is really a sick, obsessive, self-absorbed movie! Firstly, the author / instructor is quite a self-confessed guy full of sick jokes that are not fun at all. Secondly, he is also a sick perver who manipulates and poisons children's minds! I can't believe in my ears when I heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kids! <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but fell prey to Eric Schaeffer's dirty, well-known movie! <br /> <br /> And what happened to Eric Mabius' beautiful face? I mean, he met this girl that he should marry, but he wasn't in the wedding! In fact, this bald guy in his place! Has the time really flown so fast? <br /> <br /> Don't waste time watching this movie unless you're poisoned and manipulated by a sick Eric Schaeffer!
