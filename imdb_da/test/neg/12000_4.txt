Wow, what a cheesy movie this is! It starts to look like it's going to be a backwoods slasher, with the camera following dogs running through the woods. It becomes so boring and follows the story that some girls move into a house haunted by Indian spirits. We then get lots of shots of a partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bath. It suddenly becomes really cheesy when the "Zombie Indians" emerge from the ground and begin to terrorize the girls. We even get a samurai Indian. <br /> <br /> Even though I found the story of the four Indians who buried themselves interesting, this movie starts quite boring. When the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them they are not technical zombies), begin to terrorize the girls when all the fun begins. This is not a particular flick and cannot be taken seriously, it is just fun to see when you are bored or when you drink with friends. I can't help thinking though it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is boringly boring.
