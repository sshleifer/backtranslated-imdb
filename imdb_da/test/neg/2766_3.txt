The movie begins with a little girl (Rita) when her father was killed. He was apparently a criminal who squealed on his fellows. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl has grown into adulthood, and her father passed her wife! A little later, Rita meets a good-for-nothing and dating him. During one of their dates he is a little drunk and runs like a total fool. Police are hunting and he goes away quickly - meanwhile, a pedestrian is killing. Here comes the really stupid part. He convinces her to acknowledge the crime when he assures her that his lawyers can get her off scot-free. Why, oh why, would she agree? But she does and spends the next few years in prison !! And soon after her conviction this girlfriend disappears - shows that he is a total heel. What a chump !!! Later after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) informs her of the truth about her boyfriend. Then he explains that the boyfriend's family is loaded and she has to shake them down for lots of money for all the problems he put her on raping. Honestly, it makes sense - as they certainly owe it to her - especially when they knew she was going to jail and had all the intent to use her and then throw her aside. <br /> <br /> Now the idea of ​​bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good plot idea. But there is no way that this would have happened in the first place, because it is hard to believe that anyone could be so stupid to take a rap for a hit-and-run! In an interesting twist, the stupid lady decides on a life of crime - gives a wig and fetches a rich guy - takes him into the desert and robs him on guard! Wow ... how she's changed! Apparently she loves the idea of ​​stealing from "phonies" - ie. rich hypocrites. But it didn't make sense, she soon stopped doing this and started shaking down to the old darling's father - why she bothered some petty robberies in the meantime, made some sense. And what was also a little hard to believe was that instead of having money from the old smoker, she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob-controlled man to the mayor. Odd ... very, very strange. Meanwhile, another plot is developing a young Alan Ladd. He is an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mob. He was selected because he just happened to be a dead caller for a real villain - what a cliché! But it is not sensible that this real villain is not in prison and performs crimes while the fake is infiltrating the mob into another city. Finally, evidence that Ladd is able to uncover is enough to issue warrants to mob kingpins - including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing, which in the meantime she has decided to become a decent and legitimate woman, since she has met a really good guy she wants to marry! Wow, what are the odds? All in all, it is a goofy and rather stupid movie that suffers from "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are too many plate elements and strange phrases to make the movie at least believable. Plus, since the film is just over an hour long, it all seems very forced and constructed. It is a relatively bad B-movie from the crap-studio PRC of note only for the performance of Alan Ladd just before he received great fame the following year at Paramount. <br /> <br /> Thus, this DVD was released by Alpha Video --- a company that sometimes publishes some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but never clears the prints or adds closed captions . In other words, the DVD production values ​​are at best 3-rate ... at best.
