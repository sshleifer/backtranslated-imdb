I recently watched this movie on The Sundance Channel and it kept me interested from the start. But it seems to take forever to get to where it will go, and finally I felt something cheated. In a nutshell, Noble Willingham (by Walker, Texas Ranger Fame) plays a boat salesman who begins to be harassed over the phone by a man claiming to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects his son, and he (the son) enjoys reminding him. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but for me, three things have kept me from like this movie a lot. One, the movie has more foul language than Goodfella's, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross combined. 99% of it spits from Willingham himself. It didn't take long to carry me out with constant four letters. Two, I simply couldn't believe anyone would answer the phone so many times, especially when one knows that a crank call is at the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, whether it is at work, at home, a dining room, etc., the phone rings and he always responds that it spits poison on the "son" and then hangs up ONLY for the answer again, when the caller returns within ten seconds! How many of us would do that? Now I realize that we probably don't have a movie if he doesn't continue to respond, but I just couldn't suspend disbelief on that issue. Three, and this is the least modest criticism, why is the director against showing us "Corndog Man" (ie the caller / son)? Mostly, he is just a redneck-sounding voice at the other end of the phone. I could have lived with it if other things had fallen into place, but since they weren't, it was just one more thing to do. I give the movie credit to be an original idea and to keep my attention with excitement from the beginning, but it's about it. See it if it's only once. But if you are like me, you will say "Triple K Marine!" in your sleep for one night or two when you finish seeing it.
