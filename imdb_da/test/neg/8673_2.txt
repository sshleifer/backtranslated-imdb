... when we all know, no one does the BBC. <br /> <br /> To be an avid fan of this kind of Sunday night to see, I was really looking forward to this. How disappointed I was! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it looked promising, and after two minutes I found it hard to see. <br /> <br /> But I and my friends only continued to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half the characters. The plot hurried to the extreme, and the make-up and costumes were scary and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style. This modern style may have been placed within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous filmography, but unfortunately we didn't. The direction certainly felt blunt for both acting and shot choices. After 30 minutes we couldn't just see it and went out and rented 'The Prestige' (which is very good btw). Perhaps it is unfair that I judge this as I have seen so little of this, but rarely have I felt so compelled to warn people not to see anything! However, my friends and I thought the house and the parasols were beautiful - but it was as good as it gets.
