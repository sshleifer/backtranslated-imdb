This movie is simply bad. First of all, the story is just weird, and it's not well written. It leaves you questions when you are done. Sometimes it is ok but not in this case. The action is nothing to write home about. Adults do an OK job, but the kids, considering they are kids, do not do a good job. I thought the lead star, Ian Costello, like Mickey, was the worst. Well to be honest, I'm not sure it was the main role. Never really figured out who this movie was about. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some shots that stood out, but everywhere there was nothing exciting about the cinematography. However, the sound was better. There was a good score. A little adventure kind of score, although this didn't look like a fairy tale movie to me. It had some elements of a fairy tale movie, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to tell who this movie was intended for. Children? Almost. There is too much language and violence for it. Adults? I do not know. It had many elements in a children's movie in it. It was like an adult movie in a movie recording for children. <br /> <br /> The story was just weird. I don't have much idea what it really was about. You were thrown right into it without knowing anything, but there were always references to something you felt you should know. The fact that the children's parents were dead for example and that Mickey owed Pete to it. You expected to know what happened, but you never got it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was bad and a waste of time. There was no drive in it. Nothing to really move the story forward. This is not what you spend your Saturday night on.
