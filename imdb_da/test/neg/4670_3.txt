I remember thinking that because of the cast, the subject and the director would love this movie. <br /> <br /> Going into the theater and taking my seat, I was like a giddy schoolgirl as my expectation for the opening scene. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the opening and felt that I would really love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie and feel that everything that gives away scenes can be seen as a spoiler, stop reading. I don't want to give away anything really important, but it can be seen as such, so that's the warning. <br /> <br /> Spoiler can be included below, beware. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that really hit me as just ridiculous was the Russian space station scene. I mean, honestly, think of a shuttle bus without real warning and then simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can make the whole grip explode. <br /> <br /> Whilst all this is possible, it seemed to me far above the top. I'm not sure if it was just the situation, or if it was cheesy acting, the stupid view of Russian technology, or just the campy attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It only got worse for me because, as we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constantly super high explosions in space ... you know the place where there is no sound because It is a vacuum. <br /> <br /> But the coup de grace for me was honestly the weapon scene was. (spoiler option) - Earlier in the movie, we see Bruce Willis pulling out their country vehicle (the vehicle they will use to drive around when they get there and help them drill) when he is told that it is what they want to use. He takes off and complains about it, because much of what is on is heavy and not necessary for what they do. <br /> <br /> So when we walk the asteroids, we see that they have chosen to add a massive gatling as a gun to the vehicles ... you know that standard NASA fare must have heavy weapons on all space missions if You know, foreigners or something. <br /> <br /> I could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the stupid Russian space station's thought space, the cheesy love scene near the end, the Bruce Willis character is no more than most of his other past characters, but Steve Buscemi gets sour and shoots the spacecraft's gun all over the place and causing destruction / damage, well it threw the whole thing over the top for me. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteoric movie, see Deep Impact if you want a fun space movie with amazing special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this flick.
