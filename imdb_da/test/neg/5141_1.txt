I saw this movie so you don't have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what did he think about? He made it a benchmark? <br /> <br /> At least, the movie's title plays the truth in advertising, as people and objects are routinely disappearing throughout the movie and adding to the confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his comment that even he was not sure whether Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. This does not make it good for the viewer to be able to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "Making of" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. It explores the difficulties associated with funding for an indie, even if the film is shot. <br /> <br /> For credit, this movie is visually appealing and doesn't look like a movie made just over 1M. Too bad was the money not spent on a better project.
