Warning: This may include SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> First of all, I see many Lifetime movies and realize they're just ... Lifetime movies. Some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately, this film falls into the latter category. It actually started with some potential .... single, divorced hard-working mother (who goes out of work at 2 o'clock) cuts a guy away while he runs home from work and let's just say he's not taking it too well. Stalking immediately begins with phone calls and upscales to her home being broken in and completely rubbish. Then she goes to her mother's for the night, and the next morning blocks her mother's car. This seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping !!! So the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe storage and what does mom do? She goes to work and leaves the child alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a PIZZA !!! I could not believe it! Then it gets really stupid! And the end just made me sad because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it seemed to have options.
