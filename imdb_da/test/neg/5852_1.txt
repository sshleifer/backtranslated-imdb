I don't know if I'm wrong, or anyone else who says this movie is good, I would sincerely just do a favor for people who have doubts about seeing it, renting it or even worse buying it it (don't really do it!). The trailers and very early previews may seem fun in some way, but it is not fun at all, it will fall into a number of your expectations - Lay-here scenes that tend to get into really bad jokes, bad very very bad plays, tasteless scenes, cheesy effects; This movie has everything everything wrong it is. As a final comment, the movie would have been fun because of the basic concept, but believe me is really far away from it.
