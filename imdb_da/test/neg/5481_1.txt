This is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game I've ever encountered. Every time you turn around, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you cannot go through. The cut scenes give you control over your character's movements, but only to a small extent. You must also play the game for approx. 2 hours to get past intro / tutorials. It's terrible! I'm afraid if I play this game more, I will end up breaking something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, the game is terrible. To say I hate this game would be a huge understatement. I got it for sale, but I want my $ 20 back. What a waste!
