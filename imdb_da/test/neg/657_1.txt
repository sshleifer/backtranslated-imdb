According to Hollywood standards, this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movie is and therefore resembled a movie you would come out of a big-time production studio in Hollywood. That's where something far away from having Hollywood standards end. This was the WORST MOVIE I've ever seen in my life! I'm not funny. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the cinema through the review of this movie. I know what you say, "It's a horror movie, it shouldn't have a good story, it must scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the movie isn't even scary at least. It is too full of stupid bits that interrupt the little excitement that may have been. The action was also horrible, along with the murderer's fragility, which you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage smoothing. Throughout the film, I kept feeling that I was looking at something that was thought through, written, produced and led by a high schooler who overlooked too much pornography. Please do not watch this movie, use your $ 8.50 on other things like a snail which would be much more worth your time.
