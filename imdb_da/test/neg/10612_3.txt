I'm not one of those people who come out everytime a movie based on an old TV show comes out. I usually run out and see it (if I had seen the show) and try to get nostalgic. But if someone feels like running down movies based on old shows, this is exhibited A (So you can actually say something more than just "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is boring, tiring and blunt. At least, the original series were feared too long before anyone knew that teens could be so glaring, which made it groundbreaking. This is just boring. Claire Danes is nice to look at, but does nothing but mood swings and sneak around spying on evil. Giovanni Ribisi's efficiency in this flick is that Droopy the Dog sees an hour and 45 minutes. And Omar Epps looks as if he wants to fly the set, but the script's chlostraphobia has caught him. Sure, the production is great, with the now apparently mandatory "rave" nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore. Oh, and the kids shout and get angry at each other and their superiors too. It's like deciding to use the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to take a family vacation to Hollywood with your teenage kids that you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs. I really wanted to like this movie and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck the life out of it. You can beat another spelling remake, "Charlie's Angels", whatever you want, but at least the movie knew it wanted to have fun with itself. "Mod Squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went.
