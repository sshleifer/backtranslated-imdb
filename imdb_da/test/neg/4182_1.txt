After sitting through the train rack that was the first Dark Harvest movie, I couldn't leave badly alone. By seeing that there was a successor (or rather what I thought to be a successor) I had to increase my pain. Since it had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it should have been a good thing. We didn't get any killed scarecrows in this, instead we got a jackass that went around a corn field that screamed out little things like "Girls!" and "can you hear me?" occasionally. Plus we got two (four if you include the two girls the director wanted the same effect as the twins in The Shining) unpleasant little girls who couldn't shop. And the cherry on top of this root should be Corn Cop. I should have known that this movie would be horrible when the dog got an opening credit. How I managed to stay awake through this movie, I never know.
