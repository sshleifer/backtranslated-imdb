The only good thing this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice, minus the dead body parts in it. The movie is one of the most cheesy I've seen in a long time. When "Ice Cream King" dies in the beginning, I laughed so hard because the child took the ice from him and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something, and should have said "Let me be alone and let me eat the free ice so I can see my acting career go down the drain at a young age." It seems right for a line. Then I wondered why the ice princess was behind the bar on his ice car. Did anyone steal him from his twenty cents? I have never seen bars on an ice cream van window. It seemed pretty stupid. You might as well forget the action because it's just awful. Forget about this movie and go down to the dairy queen and get one ice cream.
