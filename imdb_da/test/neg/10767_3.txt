I've read every one of the Baroness Orcys Scarlet Pimpernel books. Counting this I have seen 3 pimpernel films. One with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews I greatly preferred this. It goes out of its way for violence and action, which in the meantime completely violates the spirit of the book. I don't expect movies to stick directly to the charter, I gave up on being the idealist long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book is already made, don't re-insert it with a TV movie containing excellent actors and fine costumes, but a barely decent script. Sticking with the 80s version .... Rahne
