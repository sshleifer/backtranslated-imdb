The use of "astral projection" (wandering soul) to exist outside the body, with the result that causes terrible death (... throws the inside of victims leading to broken spines and burst organs) on those who Close to it with such ability, is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL and gives Karen Black (... as Janus) another "unique" sign to fool around with as a woman influencing a commercial director, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert) Tired of his diminishing marriage and boring career. In fact, she is dying and needs her body, her spirit potentially damaging to her wife and son (his son has a "special friend" who speaks to him about things, even poisoning at some point). A detective, Kauffman (John Novak), examining the unusual murders of those killed by the benevolent spirit, connects Paul with the deaths and through Janus, he discovers. Soon, both realize that Janus should be stopped or she will simply move to another human host. What Paul does not know is that his new secretary is Janus' lover, both of whom were actually older intellectuals highlighted in his documentary on astral projection called WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie featuring a rather bizarre performance. It seems that Paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the form of a "blue man" who manipulates the child in disarray. Black, despite the star treatment, rarely shot close to taking advantage of her face, which can produce the kind of vicious evil her character guarantees. Instead, she is shot from afar, her voice called, and she never sets herself completely with the right threat, which, in my opinion, is an opportunity that has been lost. For some reason, despite the thrilling (.. if the oddball) idea of ​​astral protrusions causing a spirit to kill people from within, the film never never takes off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (.. and the sound), while at times it is mood and effective, it is often quite scary. Pacing is a problem, even as history mules along. The casting is quite slim, especially in the lead, his performance is erratic at best. It does not help that there are few characters (... except Paul's wife) we could lessen about, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not just the most lovable person in the world. It can be quite difficult and moody, his unfulfilled career is a reason for such behavior. Black should have been a more prominent figure in the film, but remains largely in the background, talked about in dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely gets a chance to entertain us with histrionics, which is a shame.
