Have some really good music and performances; Kid Creole and Coconuts, James White and Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but apart from this there is not much more to it. The dialogue, especially the story (by Saul Williams), is actually pretty good, but the performances are all pretty gentle or quite bad, no matter how many hipsters are thrown in; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter being the leading role) still do not have enough cultural credibility to keep this movie from being a news item. It goes to the Jack Kerouac style's spontaneity, but has no insight to keep it moving, which is where the band's performances come in. I think it's pretty balanced in that respect between good music and bad acting, and I enjoyed it, but I expected more. Although it has an adventure ending.
