I can't believe anyone actually paid to get this movie done. Stupid, unrealistic and stereotyped. Right from the start of the massive 747, the pilot withdrew the gases to increase speed. Then you have 5 armed people with half to fully automatic weapons who burn without as much as a ball breaking walls in the pressure cabin of 38,000 feet. Then once in the stomach of the plane, a swinging ball hits a fuel line, and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. The action was just angry and forced. There just didn't seem to be any direction. I've seen some pretty horrible B movies in my life, but with the names that were in this movie, I was very disappointed.
