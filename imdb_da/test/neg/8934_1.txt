This movie is too silly for words. Though you consider it a parody of film making, if you consider it to be a complete camp than you are wasting your time watching it - because you've seen it a hundred times before. But maybe you're a big fan of loud screaming girl voices, you still love Barbie and Ken, and you can stand this typical 80's electric guitar background noise ... Well than you get a chance.
