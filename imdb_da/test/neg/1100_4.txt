Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare find? a movie that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few genre films to be made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for making various B-class action movies and thrillers, some with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny & her two daughters come Sarah & Emma in Pennsylvania's city of Addytown to move into a large house owned by Karen's late husband after finding a miner's work in its effects. When they arrive, they find that the house is very old and needs repair. But the condition of the house is the least of their problems as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances, and Karen is confronted with the area's owner and ordered to move out. When night falls, Tunnys finds the cause of the paint: a group of zombie children killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago come out to kill everything that goes in the woods. Using a grizzled neighbor, Karen tries to end the curse before her and her children become the next victims. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD, which expects a movie with meat-eating zombies, but was let down by one thing: The movie is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick, with the dead children performing A curse mocking the forest takes revenge on something moving at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed, the children can only be pampered by victims of animals and are rejected by blood divisions on doors in the same way as vampires are rejected by Garlic and Mirrors - Should These Children Be No Zombies?). The reason as such would not be a problem and would actually be entertaining, but the biggest problem is that the producers adapted a script for the purpose of making a zombie film, only to fall flat on their faces with this effort. <br /> <br /> As such, a movie like this would be okay as a ghost story, but because of a bad script it will be nothing more than a routine routine. The film's greatest strength is to act, with the casting giving better performances than the film deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who does his role quite well ?? It's a shame that she destroys her repertoire with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombies script).
