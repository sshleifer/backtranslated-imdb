Maybe I missed something, but I found GOYA's GHOSTS to be a dull costume melodrama. With regard to history, it tried to tell that I found it a confusing mish-moss that went out in all directions. And maybe it should have been made by a Spanish director with the relevant language subtitles rather than in unconvincingly accented English. I cannot judge the historical truth of history, but it seemed to move along with a similar "artist's model's tragic fate" plot line as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. Was the film a comment on the Inquisition's religious injustices, false piety, torture now and then, or what? I never thought I could figure it out. Natalie Portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical. And in the end, the movie was crowned with the final melodrama of a disheveled Bardem's head and body hanging on the edge of the cart that went into the sunset ?? with Ines and Goya follow along backwards ?????? Can't Milos Forman do better than that?
