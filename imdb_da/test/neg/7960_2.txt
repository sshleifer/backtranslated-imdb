Water shows the situation of Indian widows in the late 1930s, eventually saying that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics in the end, referring to Gandhi several times in the film before finally having a scene depicting him and not doing anything extra normally innovative or new in the movie. Yes, the cinematography is pretty impressive, but it can't be the soul of any movie for me. <br /> <br /> India has had more problems than many other nations, but it has got rid of many of these issues as a whole. What if a film about racism is made in America for a particular year ending with 'x number of Americans still experiencing racism today'. <br /> <br /> a) How would it be relevant, and b) How would it be so extraordinary to be pictured in the cinema. <br /> <br /> A view I read from a Deepa Mehta interview was that this film is interpreted as a voice for the marginalized anywhere. From reviews I read every where, the common thing I hear is how the director did a good job and was brave to bring a problem to the world. The film is more about a specific problem that a society faces (and has become free from reforms as a whole). <br /> <br /> I can't see any land crushing the movie. In addition, the film lacked the soul and switched between Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young civilian actress, portrayed the Chuiyya role excellently, and that was the only thing that impressed me about the movie.
