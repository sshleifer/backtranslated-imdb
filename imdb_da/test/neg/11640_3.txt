Our History: Two American marine deep-sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our proof: Extremely dull entertainment at its best, without plot in sight. Jim Brown is totally wasted, assuming his help in producing this 70's war turkey. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who gave special thanks to their contributions! BOMBS AWAY !!!
