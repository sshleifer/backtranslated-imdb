This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen; It makes Plan 9 from outer space look wonderful. The actor is wood, the plot stupid and SFX non-existent. The only good thing about it is that it is not a long movie. The landscape is sometimes pretty beautiful, provided you like trees if it helps anyone!
