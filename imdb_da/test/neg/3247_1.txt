An insane attack on viewers senses. This is a mish-mash of various Hindi and English movies - badly done. The name is transferred from a 70's multi-star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts. The story is taken from the 70s Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy stares - "Nagin" and visual effects taken (a terrible experiment) from The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> Seen in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college kids !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koirala is the victim who fails a fatal attack on her by two students who a collective effort by our heros. As it turns out, Manisha is a Cobra (Nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her former life buddy is now a super powerful-all-and-any-form assumption (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge her offense and murder. Then start the crazy killing spree, where the devoted lover begins to sing each man in the group with increasing forces and tricks with consecutive trials. The effects are extremely cheap, with computer-generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stops that complete the farce. <br /> <br /> Transferring from Nagin includes Raj Babbar, who plays a Catholic priest who gives our boys temporary relief with a more "religiously correct" multi-religion cover (the original Nagin only had an "About"). Sunny Deol plays Manisha's love interest in her present life and the ultimate rescuer against the powerful Munish Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you do not fancy cheap tensions.
