Am I the only person who saw and remembered Amadeus. Each scene in "Copying" has its counterpart in Milos Forman, Amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by fringed strings, to Anna's entrance through the dark hallway of the man with the key to the very end of the dialogue with Anna at Beethoven's feet. leave Salieri before the dying Mozart. Does anyone else remember the dialogue in that script: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "Common Time". ..... "We start with strings ..." and saw it "copy". Remember Cynthia Nixon leans against a doorstep, tears fall into the fringed face - the same scene, just replacing her with Beethoven's nephew. Even the skatological humor (fit jokes) is the same. We even have a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet cookies, reminiscent of Salieri in the party room. Does anyone else remember? !!!! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna cries to God "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And besides, we have a youth script with an opening show that looks like the sign identifiers you would find in a children's story. "I am Mr Beethoven. I am the composer ...." <br /> <br /> And what is the purpose of the bridge builder? Other than equating the technical against the artistic ... a comparison that is not at all developed - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to Beethove, who was a master of the technical. <br /> <br /> There is only one big scene - the game of the ninth. First, the music, which in itself brings you to tears. But then there is the very erotic interaction between Anna, the Copist holding time and Beethoven conducting, which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But please - the rest of the movie - Where's the collective collective memory? You've seen all this before .... and better!
