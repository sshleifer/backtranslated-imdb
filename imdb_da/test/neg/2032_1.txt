This was the most uninteresting horror flick I've seen to date. The pastor is glowingly forgotten after approx. 1 minute. The action is horrible. The scary thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! What did the film festival pockets think when they gave this waste a "best movie" notation? The only reasons I didn't turn this movie off was to see what NOT to do like the movie maker, and if the paper-thin plot line really could continue as it was. I was not disappointed with the latter. There wasn't even a little bit of nudity or do to keep the kiddies interested! I also thought it was sticky to use approx. 3 minutes "Resident Evil 2" in the movie ... Should it be filler? because it was the most amazing and most interesting part of the movie.
