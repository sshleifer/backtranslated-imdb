This is just the same old crap that is spearheaded by amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - gee maybe that's why it's a straight-to-video wanna-be movie! <br /> <br /> I guess it's my fault for actually spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What a waste. I usually like B-movies, some of them are actually quite good - but it's just too ridiculous and stupid to even be fun. The losers who made this junk deserve to be put out of service for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that of course doesn't even deserve to be on film! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely no talent! Stupid plot, horrible play (especially the drums - what sicko would actually find it sexy?!), Lame writing (if there was even a script - seems like the kind of bull **** that's just made on the spot). What is stunning about this movie is its complete lack of anything well done at all. <br /> <br /> How much attention to detail would it take to ensure that each frame of a movie would be so far below any reasonable standards? I don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie on purpose, and it is unthinkable that unlucky ones could produce such consistently terrible results. <br /> <br /> At least avoid this stink bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
