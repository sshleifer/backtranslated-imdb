I do not understand at all why this film got such good grades from critics - I have seen tens of documentaries (on television) about the wine world, which was much better when (if) you see it, please think of two very annoying aspects of mondovino: first, the movie is just awful and horrible and disturbing: for me it looked as if the guy behind the camera just received the material and played with it: lots of zooms (without any purpose other than pressing the button in / out ) For example - I almost stopped to see it because of it! Secondly, the interviewer (the director I believe) is not really relevant: he looks and poses questions like a boy's specialist, not as a journalist, although the general idea and themes would have been interesting, too bad conclusion: overrated documentary, perhaps only for men that doesn't know anything about wine => not recommended at all (2/10)
