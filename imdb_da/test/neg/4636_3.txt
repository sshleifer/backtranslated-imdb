Here's the example number 87,358 of Hollywood's anti-biblical bias, so typical of them. <br /> <br /> Early, Ray Liotta has made a wife and women are being interviewed for the housekeeper position. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned look (dress, fashion, speech) that immediately sets strict rules, saying that "there will be two-hour Bible study ever." <br /> <br /> Of course, this is saying making it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on anyone, especially a child. Once again, the Bible is similar to speculated, medieval people. That woman will of course be dismissed immediately. Of course, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is employed and voil√† saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawn.
