SPOILER !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm .... I just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi hadn't made any horrors so I checked into it. I saw the "mind ripper" I checked on my Tivo for it. There was an air date on Sci Fi. So I was put. I got my pop corn ready came in and put on the couch and what the hell is this? A freakin daring guy in blue sweat pants ran around yelling! Nothing is scary about this movie at all! If something is fun! Funny how low the budget is, fun, how predictable it is, fun how bad the play is and fun how much money it does. Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor, but this movie is stupid. It's so stupid. They killed him in the end, and then they go on this plane and the "monster" is on it. They shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls far to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The Killers Ending, Its Still Alive! WOOHHH! Daunting! woooohhhh! Sucky fat sacks of crap waste in 2 hours. Bottom Line: You have a place to go and you have to kill some time. Mind Ripper is not the proposal. I'd rather sit naked in the snow than see this movie once. <br /> <br /> OVERALL GRADE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
