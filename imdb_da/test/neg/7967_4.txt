This is unique in the films of Hitchcocks that I have seen because I didn't really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found it quite predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newlywed couple. He's the kind of "gracious rogue" character you've seen in many movies without being lovable as far as I'm concerned! In fact, at best, it was a barely credible relationship, and at times it seemed particularly fake and incredible. <br /> <br /> Not being able to hold a job and trying to live a lavish lifestyle, Grant has led to borrowing money that he can't pay back. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her for the money she is insured for; and probably what his late father was worth. <br /> <br /> On average and quite uninteresting all the time, but as usual you can see the influence on movies that have come at a later date.
