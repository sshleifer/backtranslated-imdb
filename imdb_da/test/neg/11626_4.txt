Mickey Rourke (who once was a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows a school bus full of kids so angry with his actions, decides to leave the IRA and runs in London <br /> < br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie is quite disturbing as the lives of young children end in a fireball. Things like this happened during the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in Northern Ireland, giving a prayer for the dead a sharp realism. But as soon as Fallon decides that he will give up violence (What? He is a terrorist and he has never blown up innocent crimes before?) Realism disappears, and clichés and ridiculous plot twists take place. Martin is employed in London underworld (does not have their own hit men?) To commit a hit while wearing an IRA "uniform" (Never knew provos had uniform) at a cemetery in broad daylight (Wouldn't an IRA man use a bomb placed under a car?) Where he is spotted by a priest who recognizes him while he was in SAS. Hands up, who do I think lies? I am not and we are halfway through the running time and there are still more clichés to come. <br /> <br /> It all sounds very silly, and that's what you expect from a novel by Jack Higgins? Everything is clichéd, constructed and stereotypical, and the bits that are not, are simply bizarre. The critics beat this movie when it came out, especially they said it could have some potential if the movie had Bob Hoskins who played gangster Jack Meehan, and Alan Bates, who played the SAS soldier, became a priest and once had the critics been right. They should also note that the movie might have been less gloomy if Fallon was played by someone who was able to make an Irish accent. Rourke can be hunky and macho (Oh gawd another movie with an IRA uberhunk), but accents are not his strong point more than character act is. To give you an idea of ​​how disappointing the fine for DYINGEN is the director ended up lifting what is always a bad sign. As a footnote, the original release of the FINE FOR DEATH in the UK was delayed for months due to "The Enniskillen bombing". In November 1987, the preliminary IRA exploded a bomb in the center of the Enniskillen, where a memorial parade was held commemorating Britain's war death. Eleven (11) people were killed and scored more wounded. It wasn't an accident and no one left the IRA because of it
