Let me first start by saying this movie SOUNDED very interesting: A serial killer who copies the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers all the time). Sounds cool, doesn't it? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. And that's not an exaggeration. I have seen many very, very bad movies. This one takes the cake. And I was even prepared for a bad movie before I went into it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the author should have studied some law enforcement procedures: If you have the name of the killer, have his entire life's history, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place to look? Hmm. . . optionally. . . his house? What?! NONE! It's a noble idea, Anthony! How could you suggest something so obvious and leveled instead of going to a bowling alley? * spoilers end * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good, but the play is bad, or vice versa. . . but it just had everything wrong with what you could find. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest pet error was how the police / FBI acted. For example: Black FBI Agent: "Okay, threatened woman, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I walk in and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer will be." Sounds good to you? "Moronic Female FBI Agent:" Yes, that sounds okay to me. Go ahead. I will certainly not focus on my surroundings or at least control the perimeter. "Black FBI Agent:" Excellent, that's what I would do! "Honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn, how you should not act ... or if you are a human being and want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: A half point just to get a movie produced and in stores. /> <br /> -AP3-
