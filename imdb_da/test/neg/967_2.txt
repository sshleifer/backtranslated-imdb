For all purposes and purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because having Deniro in the throw adds instant credibility and makes you watch the movie. I had also made a mistake by watching 48 hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason Eddie Murphy still thought fun. Well he is not. In fact, it almost seems like he's been neutralized. When I watched this movie, I was surprised that Deniro decided that this was a good enough script to borrow his name as well. No chemistry between him and Murphy at all. Terrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think should be good cannot be much worse than this. Not too long after sitting through the arsenal that was Showtime, I happened to see National Security with Martin Lawrence. The movie had its fun parts, but wasn't that great. But it was still 20 times better than Showtime. Please if your Deniro fan doesn't see this movie !!
