This is a horrible movie from almost every point of view. Since much has already been pointed out in previous reviews, let me just focus on "Serbs" and "Delta Force" boys in this movie. 1) The uniforms that "Serbs" carry are not Serbian. And helmets are also wrong. 2) The actors playing "Serbs" do not speak Serbian, not even a language close to Serbian, as opposed to "behind enemy lines", where the Czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least some credibility to the film. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-eyed "Serbian general" looks and acts like a moron, shooting his gun when American soldiers call his name: <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Give up!" <br /> <br /> - Gray-eyed moronic general: (burns his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Come out!" - GBMG: (burning his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! You're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (burning his AK47) <br /> <br / > - Prop guy: "Sorry, Mr. Gray-bearded moron general, see we're out of sight and I sent the boy to buy something more, but he's not back yet ..." <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) When did the army answer AK47s to Delta Force? I suppose they could not find enough working environments in Bulgaria, but there were lots of old AK47s and advanced subjects;) Maybe they should have gone for some airsofts, they are cheaper and would not have hurt the film's credibility anyway. .. 5) In the scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger on the trigger all the time. No sense person with any weapon training or just common sense would ever do it. I suppose the actor expected his coolness to increase, the longer he kept the gun that way. <br /> <br /> This movie is such an insult to common sense ..
