It is probably a cultural thing --- somehow the native of this country has been conditional on finding these things fun. I have experienced this phenomenon first hand during an open-air cinema event where this movie was shown before the function. Most of the native audience laughed, and no, it was not in a sanatorium or a late childhood clinic. It was in a good area and the audience consisted mainly of educated adults. <br /> <br /> So it must be possible to somehow find this entertaining, but honestly to goodness, I have no idea what it requires --- maybe it is in the air or water, prolonged exposure which causes this condition. Something must lead to it, of course, the only thing I can say is that I am absolutely sure what does not cause it: the film itself. There are no jokes in it. It's brain dead, silly, obscene, unfunny, lame. In short, it's a waste of time. Anyone Tom and Jerry are more fun, even though funerals are more fun. <br /> <br /> Only if you have been fortunate enough to never have seen any of Stooges' beliefs: There are three guys who behave, run and even speak like retarded infants that cause all kinds of unfunny mayhem, without plot, no real purpose and no real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a crowd watching this waste in this country can be quite disturbing because you want to be a party with a bunch of potheads, and you are the only one who doesn't has smoked something. <br /> <br /> Unless you are willing to rouse yourself to do this or be equipped with whatever it is that makes people think about seeing three ugly old men behave like fun fun , my advice on this is: Stay way. Far away.
