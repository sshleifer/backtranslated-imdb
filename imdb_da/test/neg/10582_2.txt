Superhero Movie (2008) is the latest in the long line of "parody" movie films that I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the genre's death, but I know it's not awful enough to put the last stitch in the coffin. <br /> <br /> If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go, then Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately, the Spartans were actually miles under the barrel, and this movie does little. Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs. It's got Drake Bell (Kid's from Disney's Drake and Josh), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and a few others scattered everywhere. Even though it has the power to light a 40 watt bulb, the movie doesn't use any humor. This movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which are dedicated to following the Spiderman plot and not a single joke is fun. I didn't laugh or smash the whole time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Don't even think about it. For love of cinema, just skip it, and maybe they won't come out with someone else. <br /> <br /> Who am I doing fun? They will probably come out with another in the fall.
