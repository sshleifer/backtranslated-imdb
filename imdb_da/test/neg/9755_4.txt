Step Up is a fair dance movie about some children who get their big break. The movie is average in every way with a little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with a accomplished partner and a teacher who sees something special. The play was fine, but the dialogue and the director had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. Nevertheless, you still feel good about the outcome of the movie. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B + movie with moderate continuity errors and dialogue abuses. The landscape was good and the signs were true to life. It's worth seeing if you like that kind of movie.
