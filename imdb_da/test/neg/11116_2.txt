I didn't like this movie for so many reasons, I can't even say everything. I thought it was badly made just because of the whole story. I mean who thinks they caught the chupacabra and it broke loose on a cruise ship. LAME!!! It was okay for a lama just for video movie but not worth spending money on it. I can't believe anyone actually gave this movie a ten. But I guess there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1, just because it was about the chupacabra, and it had the guy from the lord of the rings. If you want to watch this movie, I would stay home and wait for it to come on the sci-fi channel. Don't waste your money watching this movie. Believe me.
