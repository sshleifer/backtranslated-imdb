This evil little movie is horrible. My low rating for that comes for two main reasons. The first is that it is a snus movie for animals, and I find that the whole concept is so sour, it becomes my stomach. Filmed over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. This movie is complete and complete exploitation made for cash on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Historical interest concurrently, this is something to look at if one finds itself in the grip of morbid fascination. Row number two? Look at the way the camera is created. It is placed in the best possible position to fully capture the full effect: Long march forward for the elephant, perfect picture of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically scary view of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before finally falling together. Sickening. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are not in doubt. No one is perfect, but when you realize that this movie gave A a chance for him to drum early film competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted, and B) he filmed the performance to demonstrate DC's greater efficiency as opposed to for AC, you can't do without wondering if the researcher in him was a little too dispassionate and cold. Any number of Peter Cushing's mad scientists would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and rebellious.
