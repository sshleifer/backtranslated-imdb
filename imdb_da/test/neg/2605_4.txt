This could have been good. The voice headers are just right and fit the characters of a T. A small problem, however; The appearance of the characters, mostly the support or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on all faces only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks a little strange to see a really great guest's voice coming out of a lifeless shape like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a voice-over for this show, and it seemed odd to be fun. <br /> <br /> There are a few other issues, one of which is the family plot. The Simpsons did a lot better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got into. Here we get too much annoying redirects as if someone has a strange imagination, and then we have to find fun but of For some reason the delivery is a bit gone. As you probably can tell, it is difficult for me to put a finger on what is wrong with this show because it is basically no more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "Married to children". <br /> <br /> If I was to point out what's wrong with this, it is probably repetition. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character, but neither of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is kind of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best of this show and it is the most stereotypical part of the show. So what more can I say. There isn't exactly something wrong with this show, but in the long run, one has to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons have done for almost two decades.
