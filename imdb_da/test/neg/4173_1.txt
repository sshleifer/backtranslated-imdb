What can be said about this? Really one of the most insane experiences in my life. Your brain will try to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation. I was left crushed by the experience of seeing this 'movie' and I took a good two hours to fully recover. This film is now associated with Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the horror movie of the horror film. I certainly do not believe this distinction in a good way. I mean this in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This film has no redeeming features. Everything is appalling. Artificial camera work gives us infinite us the ugliest attitude that is conceivable, ie. lots of corn, lots of mud. The story is beyond stupid. The script is ?? was there a script? The villain is highly unscary and has yellow wellington boots. The kids are annoying. The leading man is charism free. And it has arrogance to continue for 100 minutes. Completely without profit at any level, this is akin to torture. Normally, such a statement will be an exaggeration intended for comic effect. Not in this case. I will even say it again ?? this is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. Fortunately this was short. But when I came in, I decided to look at 'Making Of' featurette. I had to understand. Perhaps there would be a reasonable explanation for this cruelty. Was it an elaborate joke? I saw the first 2 minutes of 'Making Of' featurette and discovered that the author / director, to put it mildly, was something misunderstood. I also discovered it because I had taken the time to see the first two minutes of 'Making Of' featurette by Dark Harvest 2 that I was an idiot. Not a comfortable journey of self-discovery. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Very unused.
