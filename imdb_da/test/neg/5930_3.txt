This movie was ok as far as movies go. It could have been made as a crossover to secular films. However, it had little to do with the left behind books that it supposedly was based on. Large historic premises were removed and new large historic premises added. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was how Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers which he did not have at that time in the books. The Antichrist is not Satan, is not omniscient and not omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and faith were portrayed in strange, surrealistic ways that seemed to make the movie just stupid. <br /> <br /> Non-believers looking at this will have more ammunition to mock Christian faiths.
