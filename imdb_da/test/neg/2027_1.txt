I found this DVD in the store and figured out why not support some indy movies and watch a cool horror flick. Please save your time and money and forward it. The action, the script, virtually everything with this movie is underpair. There is really not much of a story and there is no sign development. I didn't find myself worried about what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened. Everyone is supposed to be a university age, but they all look like they are in the mid-thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who looks like she is pushing 40. In fact, the worst part of the movie is that every scene is shown in a headshot. There is no editing, no cut ins or close ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
