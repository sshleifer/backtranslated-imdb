This movie was so bad it was fun! For a while I thought I actually looked at a parody of a bad movie (a la "For Your Consideration"). The "Cliffhanger" scene at the end made me laugh until my insides were hurt. The scripture was horrible enough, but combined with Sean Young's horrible acting - especially while explaining the entire plot in detail (complete with flashbacks) while scaring off a rock - making it a truly classic bad movie worth seeing! The Fakey shots in this scene actually reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing was made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How were star actors attached? Were they low in their careers? Questions, questions.
