This is a horrible Hollywood remake of a classic British movie. All that made the original "Italian job" entertaining has been blown out of this partying wound in a movie "scripted" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly "directed" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (author of the original movie) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and television projects in the last 40 odd years. Although it is unclear about this stink, it is not a good thing. The humor is forced, the drama is exercised, all the characters are cookie-cutter-like crims (with the exception of Charlize Theron's incredible beautiful safe cracker / rally driver) and the plot only matches the original at the following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (the modern BMW versions, but Minis anyway) <br /> <br /> (2) Using names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the protagonists <br /> <br /> (3) Disrupting a city's traffic management system for to secure a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> Is that it? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, what you get is a gentle and unlikely American by-the-numbers heist movie where a gang of jolly pirate chums gets better off their evil associations. Believe me, it feels like a terrible long time before they do it. The saucepan does their best with what they get, but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the quirky nature of the original films and clear British tastes have survived feeding into the Hollywood hamburger. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking breast. It is strange that Noel Coward has not made an Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked his teeth at anyone involved in this light remake halfway down his throat. <br /> <br /> Italian Job? More like Italian Jobbie.
