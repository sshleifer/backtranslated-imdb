The appeal with this movie must be the artistic Euro style because there is absolutely no substance. A lot of things happen there seems to be a place ... but it never comes there. <br /> <br /> It is hard to come up with a full 10 lines of comments, because this movie is such a completely empty experience. There is lots of great photography of a cemetery, some real lame zombie effects, some flashing of what can surpass surreal humor and a weak, existential ending. These elements undermine each other. Exactly when you might enjoy the creepy mood, there is some stupidity with jumping heads or zombie sex. To keep from screaming with boredom, connect the minimal storyline - and it dissolves in ridiculously illogical. It's like someone took several half-baked B movies and threw them into a blender. What comes out is mostly a movie * about * meaningless - and * not * a good one. It will clearly impress the category of artificial fan, which sees emptiness as distinct from the depth. Everyone else should be comfortable with this boring mess.
