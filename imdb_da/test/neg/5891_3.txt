I honestly expected more from this movie. It could have been the problem. There wasn't even when the camera was still - ever. At close-ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get a headache. The cuts are so often and so fast that the viewer often finds himself wondering what has just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy end after being done so much useless, it is believed to understand what is going on, they are lost. For me, this was a basic horrible movie, destroyed by a camera man with ADHD, and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot.
