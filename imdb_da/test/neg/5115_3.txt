This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scott's, "Someone To Watch Over Me", which is a classic. It's the stars Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the bad guy from Fugitive. It is a quality film with good direction and fantastic plays. This film is the polar opposite. It's the same plot, just minus some good acting and adds TV movie direction. I must say that I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She is warm and their romance is credible on many levels. Unfortunately, this alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic Ridley Scott movie. Usually crappy TV movies have some redeeming quality that makes them at least observable. I believe for me, this movie's redeeming value is that Rob Lowe and the leading female have chemistry. It and I could see and compare the plot with another quality movie.
