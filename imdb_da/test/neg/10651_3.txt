Don't forget the serious logical gaps, never remember the sharp cliché character images, so remember the random writing, and you like this movie. The protagonist Alyssa should be endearing, the heroine you throw to be saved (or in this case save himself). But instead she just laughs and makes it wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Of course, her busy mother was only needed to further develop the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to tear your poor, innocent, young girl out of your understanding, with an ever-present bitter artistic director / villain. And cliché! Not only does she become anorexic, bulemic, a super-junkie and a pathological liar, but all within a few months. It's like the author read all the horror stories he could dig up the ball and decided to see how much he could do for two hours (with advertising). Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. This "uprising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulemia that happens is non-existent in all the dance schools I have participated in. In fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might get a better chance For a few pounds easier, most of the dancers in my classes would actually be considered less overweight. I am not saying that eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent that it was portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem this movie had was the way to print. Her on again out girlfriend probably had the entire half hour total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting signs were only props, decorations to advance the story. In light of the right dialogue, this would have been a very complicated study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a woman's show, and Kimberly McCullough doesn't have the chutzpah to pull it off. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this movie would be a supposed "insight" into what really goes behind a closed doors in a ballet company. For a dancer, this is a very offensive film depicting ballerinas as stupid and parents as intrusive and poorly informed. These adjectives more accurately describe the people who got this in the air in the first place. 3.10
