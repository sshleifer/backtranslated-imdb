I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee's Burkes Robicheaux mysteries. When I read 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead' was filmed and Tommy Lee Jones led the lead, I was thrilled. Having seen it last night, I stop turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see more people shot or turned up. Don't make me wrong, I don't mind blood and gore - I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Maybe it was just that I had seen 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before I saw it. I know that Burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the 'In The Electric Mist', can be like the Cajun swamps he writes about, filled with things that have never been fully explained. In a book it's fine. In a movie, it's confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also glowing admirers of Dave Robicheaux, making it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince) I felt it was so waste of their talents together - they gave good performances in a movie that did not coincide. Now I say this, as I have only seen the USA DVD and hope that Tavernier's cut will make a huge difference. On the plus side: The soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes in the Robicheaux place were perfect - just as I imagined the bait shop to look. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, just as Walter Breaux was Launcher. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a uniform person at the start of the movie, and then whacking people with different instruments begins. All in all, I wanted them to have filmed more of 'Electric Mist and Confederate Dead' and released much of Robicheaux's investigation, explained Elrod's gifts and his ties to Dave, as well as Dave to the General. Then I would not feel today as I did last night when I knocked it off, "What just happened?"
