I wouldn't call myself a big fan of the ingenuity of the silliness, so maybe I'm not the best audience for this show. Although I am a critic, I have a feeling for what I personally like and dislike. This is the later. <p> Lack of humor is a great farewell when it comes to comedy; it can be fun and perky for about 4 minutes and then you start to get bored unless it's the badger animation from a few years ago (? ) This is the opposite, with a rigid script and all assaulted voice-overs it is just stupid and very very boring to be exposed to. Unfortunately, as it had a big market in front of itself and a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> Waste of time.
