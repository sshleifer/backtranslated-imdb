I found Super Troopers only mildly entertaining at best (seemed like a glorified Police Academy ripoff to me) and I rented this movie hoping it was better. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this movie is even worse. It doesn't feel like there's a lot going on in this movie or that it really gives us a reason to confuse any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The actor playing Felix is ​​completely uninspired, though possibly partly due to the dialogue he had to work with. In short, this movie just went wrong in so many places. I get the impression that since movies like Clerks seem independent filmmakers to think that they can make movies like this with long, leaping scenes of dialogue where characters try to be fun. But where dialogue in Clerks pushes the story forward, in this movie, it weighs hopelessly. The movies must have a decent action and dialogue balance, and it is as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to get tons of insidious, fun dialogue, it just doesn't always work. Especially if they are not so good at writing dialogue. I hate to say that, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and that movie was so low budget it was shot on video.
