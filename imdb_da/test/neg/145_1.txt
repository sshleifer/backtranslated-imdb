This movie is really a big piece of waste trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production. Basic History Overview (Stupid Robot Robot) ... very badly the play of unspecific pop idols ... and they are trying to "Giant" !! ! My goodness ... these miserable actors use wires to make them look like "good fighters" ... :( and I hate the arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !! ! I will never touch his movie again. FRAG this movie at all costs !!! I would give it a negative value out of ten ... not even worth 0/10.
