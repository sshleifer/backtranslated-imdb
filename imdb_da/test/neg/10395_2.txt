I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures were so scary and I don't usually see movies that are automatically released on DVD, but it looked so interesting and scary! I was very in the mood for a good scary movie, and for me, possession is one of the most embarrassing issues to look at or learn about. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both amazing films that made breakthroughs not only horror wise, but also history. <br /> <br /> Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from the Sheep goes automatically, so we can't even tell what kind of person she should start with. But a former wife beater turned the pastor on the case with a gardener ...? I know ... I know. Then they go into several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the pastor beat the sister and struck around with Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we come into a story with Isabelle's father and his questioning of his wife's allegiance to him. <br /> <br /> I mean, the story goes just in too many directions and was not well developed at all. Not to mention that exorcism did not seem to be authentic at all, and more of one just scaring your pants of the type of movie that I didn't like at all because I couldn't take it seriously. The one who instructed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to correct the story well, so I wouldn't really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
