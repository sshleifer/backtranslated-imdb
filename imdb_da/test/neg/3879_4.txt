Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time great time! I wonder that Govinda did this movie? Govinda ... dude ... m your big fan, you have to make real decisions now by choosing movies? I wonder he had any role in that movie. Govinda's role could be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... dud you rock! You've created space in everyone's heart all over the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree .... you deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good at his witty! generally there were few scenes where I laughed ... otherwise I just wondered "in hell did Priyadarshan make such a silly movie?" Anyways, let's wait and see upcoming movies.
