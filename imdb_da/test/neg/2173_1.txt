I usually do not write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie, but I was watching. It was like a terrible car wreck with blood flow all over the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so completely ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not fun, not even stupid / silly. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to show a shit on family gatherings. It is painful to see, but at least it is only a moment or two. Second String continued for over an hour. <br /> <br /> The one involved in making this movie should not work again. Writing, managing, acting and everything was just awful. The problem is that I can't describe how bad it was; You had to see it. And I'm sure this will never be shown again, so unless you saw it, you're out of luck. I think it was almost worth seeing just because it gave me some gratitude for every other "bad" movie I've seen throughout my life. And for each movie I see in the future that I can't stand, I want to think of myself, yes it was certainly not bad like the other string.
