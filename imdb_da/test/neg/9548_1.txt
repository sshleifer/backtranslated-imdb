* Criticism mentions spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely make user comments, but it's a movie, I have no trouble forging. This movie stinks and its mediocre rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such a mass. The bean collector is not at all the same caliber film as Silence of the Lambs or Seven was, despite what its advertising claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow - I actually left for about 10 minutes halfway through and came back on the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Joly's character debates Denzel on cutting off like 'hands'. The movie is not scary at all, but tries to compensate for this with a love subplot, though sexy Angelina Joly's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course, what you get is something that is comparable to the relationship between the mentor-student relationship, as seen in the Brillian Epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, although this lacks all effectiveness and I personally direct for the villain to kill Denzel off to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crazy film, I was half expecting a plot twist or some sort of spectacular situation that would end up at the end to give the film some credit, like mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream. Anyone with a 4th grade education can see the end, how will be solved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's rear window). Klichen about getting the killer to explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that I had spit latte over the screen. Esoterically, I even think that the killer's intention was completely lost when Denzel happily regains his loss of the wordful "chess game" and gets with his pet project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and true dynamic concepts (as I am), you will not appreciate this movie. If you haven't participated in a single movie in your life and would like to catch every Hollywood clich√© ever borne (the late night knocking on the window from someone other than the killer, the ridiculous serial killer to investigate the relationship, the terrible one) Woman trying to get past in a man-dominated workforce aka SOTL), watch this movie .... but even then it is too slow and you will be bored.
