Okay, be nice to be short. This movie was not just bad, it was very very bad, with line4s being "if you deal with the devil you expect to get on your shoes", you know your in hideous movie scene. After watching this movie I wanted to kill myself and the whole family, it gave me such a great sense of self-suffering that I would murder. Don't watch this movie. I will kill again. But when I do, it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for getting action sequences and bad shirts. Fortunately, there is a flipside, it's the first action movie to have a three door ford. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it ends up being waste on its roof :( <br /> Ps: Worse than Marksman
