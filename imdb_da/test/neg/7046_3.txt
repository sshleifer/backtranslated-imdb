It's really a shame. There was so much controversy about this picture (in other words, the infamous affair between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), as this made a lot of attention to a very forgotten movie. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. And on top of that, the movie is filled to the brim with amateur actors who barely speak English. I would really have preferred subtitles - it would have made the experience less exhausting. Back to the rat play. The Neo-realist movement was great in Italy at the time this film was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (like De Sica's Umberto D., the Kids see us and Miracle in Milan) because they got so much out of the non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they act like normal people. Trying to be actors and coming out very badly - like kids in a school game. <br /> <br /> By the way, ... if you hope the movie has a good ending (making your time worth the movie worth it), don't bother. The reason was just totally uninvolving and silly - so much so that I really found out that I could have looked less like the characters. Like the island they all inhabit, the film is deserted and without color or life.
