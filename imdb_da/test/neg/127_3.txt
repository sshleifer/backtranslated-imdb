I love sci-fi and am willing to put up a lot. Sci-fi movies / TV are usually underfunded, undervalued and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is for good TV sci-fi, since Babylon 5 is for Star Trek (the original). Stupid prostheses, cheap pop sets, stylized dialogues, CG that do not fit the background, and painful one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those out there who think Babylon 5 is a good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clich√©d and uninspiring.) While American viewers like emotions and character development, sci-fi a genre that does not take you seriously (cf. Star Trek). It can handle important problems, but not as a serious philosophy. It's really hard to worry about the characters here, as they're not simply foolish, just lacking a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wood and predictable, often painful to see. Earth makers know it's a nonsense, as they always have to say "Gene Roddenberry's Earth ..." otherwise people wouldn't continue to see. The carcass's ashes must turn in their orbit, as this boring, inexpensive, poorly edited (see it without the advertising break really brings this home) trudging Trabant off a show lumbers in space. Spoiler. Then kill a protagonist. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas again.
