Every time I see this movie, blood comes out of my eyes. Yes, you read it right: I've seen this miserable, more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis calls in a script and surrenders the directives, Rodney Dangerfield (wise) went away from the project because they would not allow him to think with the script, Bill Murray showed excellent judgment and was not part of it, and a doll was pushed forward as the player's role player who deserved much better. <br /> <br /> I can't help thinking of Dyan Cannon in this and wondering why she's always laughing and smiling. The only conclusion I can draw is that she is actually pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. She must have watched as the film came together and reveled in the incredible pain that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry about movie gigs that would have this movie inflicted on them. She may also have been very full. That's what I need to be right now to wash the evil taste of this complete and complete mistake out of the cave. If I'm lucky, it will be washed forever. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times. I blame many of them in childhood and are a very boring and obscure boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensitivity. Maybe dolls are just fun when you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is more fun now ... guess I was just boring. Caddyshack 2 is the rare kind of movie that is so extraordinarily disappointing at so many levels that you convince yourself after the final credit that it couldn't have been as bad as all that. It was. It is. It will only get worse over time. <br /> <br /> My reasons for going back to this movie mercifully become fewer. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene is not bad and brought out of my only chuckle. We see him a couple of times, but it gets as tired as the rest of the movie and comes down with unfortunate speed from the eerie entertaining to the vapid wasteland. Randy Quaid disapproves well and this movie owes him great time, because if there was reason to watch this movie as something other than a torture tactic, he was. Maybe it's the trick in the movie. It probably has potentially conflicting qualities that people see in it, is horrified at what they have done for themselves, but later because the choices were so slim, one can only remember what really gave them entertainment. Years later they invariably look at it again and the cycle is repeated. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is very much to blame for this movie, but in fairness I am not sure he deserves it. He really tries out there, but it is impossible not to notice that he is using the entire movie to make a Rodney Dangerfield imitation. That's who the movie was written for, but I'm not sure he could have saved it. In the end, it fails harmlessly through terrible direction, poor editing (should we count the continuity errors?) And a rehashing of the same story with none of the angry humor or heart that made the first movie experience. <br /> <br /> Turns kicks and screams up to three out of ten instead of two of Randy Quaid's bulldog determination. It's not even bad enough to laugh at. I have definitely seen worse, but trust your memory - this is a dog. If you've never seen it, you've made excellent life choices and I welcome your outstanding judgment.
