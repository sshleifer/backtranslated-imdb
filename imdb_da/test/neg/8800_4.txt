"The Man From Utah" opens with a song cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback. This is how we are introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), going into town and looking for work. When helping Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting, the Marshal offers him an undercover job as a substitute to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the recruitment of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), which also happens with the head of the rodeo committee. Serious contenders for the supremacy of Barton's top male Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) are severely ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even back in these 1930s Lone Star Westerns, John Wayne had a charismatic presence suggesting future star quality. If nothing else, then Wayne so young in these movies is a real treat. The movie itself cuts into a fast fifty-minute pace, much of it preoccupied with stock rodeo recordings of yelling, bulldog and Indian parade and dancing. In the decisive rodeo event, Weston avoids disaster by discovering a poisoned needle inserted in the hall of "Dynamite", a formerly unbroken bronco, to which he must leave Cheyenne. The end is not surprising when Barton's bad boys disappear to win the rodeo events and go to the thirty thousand dollars pot of prize money deposited in the local bank. But the Marshal and Weston are there to foil their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen in films like "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone", Wayne's character closes the movie in a rivet with a beautiful young lady, this time the judge's daughter Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young) pined for him throughout the movie.
