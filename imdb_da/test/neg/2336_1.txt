How does David Lynch do that? Unlike the legions of thick-black-framed glasses-types and pretentious film critics who praise his name, I just can't see how this guy is being paid to make such a trip. How can Lynch snooze superior footage from a flawed TV pilot to an inappropriate, badly acted mess and have critics rave about it and actually include it on Best Lists of the Year? <br /> <br /> I'm confused. If you're looking for a good movie noir, rent "Bound" instead. If you're looking for a good "puzzle" movie, try "Memento". But beware of this exaggerated stink unless your idea of ​​a fun night throws away 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard earned money.
