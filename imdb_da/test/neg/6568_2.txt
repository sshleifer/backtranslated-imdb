Although I'm not a fan of the "Star Trek" movie or the universe of shows and books, I still find pleasure in some of the movies with the old cast and in the case of "First Contact", even the new one threw a bit. This one, however, was a little sad to see ... it seemed so much, but not so many levels managed to be one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very far from apparently combining three or four stories into an ultimate Trek adventure, but it ends up with an unfunny when it tries to be, not tense when it will be and not acted packed as it tries to root out inconsistencies. The whole movie to take a phrase from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special since I've seen episodes of Next Generation that are just as good, that is, it's fine for a TV show, but not a big movie picture. The reason is ridiculous as the gang initially tries to stop Spock's brother, so he joins him on his quest to find God, yes you read it correctly. The Klingons make a pronounced look that will actually create the much better undiscovered Country movie. All in all, you know it's bad when the best part of the movie is Kirk, Bones and Spock, sings rows of your boat. Spock was not really singing, but asked the lyrics.
