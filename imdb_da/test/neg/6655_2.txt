They give you the setup so you live to death with a constant cat and mouse hunt. The main characters are involved in a constant stand-off where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I would like to see the police force that would let one of their police pull out the A. Garcia piece. It's like a local policeman, Charlie Manson goes out of prison to get a cup of coffee. Stay true!
