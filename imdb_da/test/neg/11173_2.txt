This is only the fourth effort I have seen from this director (which I met and found quite brilliant at the Italian Film Festival in the Italian Film Festival in 2004) and possibly also the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTER (1989) that preceded it, this is an excellent example from the Euro-Cult era's ending end - primarily because it shows the depths of the former refreshing style this time! <br /> <br /> In fact, we get a plot that turns around - I'm not talking, folks - a killer phone! Exactly but bland Charlotte Lewis - in his third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - is a model that seems to have just ended an affair; She expects her architect to call her back, but every time the phone rings, everything she gets is statically accompanied by voices from the other side (or something like that). She turns to a new tenant in her apartment block, who comfortably knows about an authority on paranormal activity (William Berger) - which hilariously explains that the negative energy released, under the family's arguments, can manifest itself through household appliances into a deadly force (I swear I don't do this)! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... are ... lows of the movie: the grumpy bartender from whose shudder the heroin calls a few times (it seems that the chain of events can only be destroyed by having Lewis again through his steps, EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) style!), The unprecedented series of prominent appearance phones on display, the apparatus of heroes photographer's friend sneaks at her before the murder, the sarcastic policeman who greets Lewis to report the strange events ("And what is the toaster, I wonder?"), the violent rape killed by a barrage of coins shooting out of a phone book and Berger's own bloody death (with the phone affecting the pacemaker he is equipped with and causing the doctor's heart to explode)! <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is quite confusing, and apparently is finally seen all the 'lost souls' in a crowd of pigeons and flying out of the window of the 'occupied' office (a uniform service!). For what it is worth, the score - by ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti no less - is effective enough, despite the fact that dated heavy metal tracks on the audio track are included.
