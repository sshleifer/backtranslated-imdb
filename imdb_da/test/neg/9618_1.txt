The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was very poorly executed. The mastering engineer must have been either full, asleep or not even in the room while it was being done. It looks like it was mastered from approx. a tenth generation copy and about half way through the movie, the audio synchronization disappears. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the sound. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, save your money. I remember watching this movie at the theater in 1973. Also the VHS copy of this movie entitled "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining several minutes of the movie is "missing". Where is the original camera negative?
