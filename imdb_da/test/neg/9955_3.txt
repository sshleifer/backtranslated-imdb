There are so many gaps in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Of course he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised he ended up in the genre. This is typical, "I want to create monsters that can be used to fight as an army." By transferring wolf blood (or is it coyote) to his hired hand, he turns him into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as the Frankenstein monster, plays the friendly and beloved hired man who is the victim of trust in the evil doctor. Initially, the researcher can check when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But as the invisible man, he suddenly starts morphing on his own and becomes a responsibility. There is a little love story about the daughter and a reporter with a kind of loud voice (Golly Miss Brooks). She will leave, but her father, the doctor, will not allow it. He is also run by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he needs satisfaction. The way he plots to scare or kill them is quite far-fetched and depends a lot on Petro and the boys are waiting to be attacked. It's not a really good movie. The strong point is the atmosphere of the forest, which people and monsters lurk around the Spanish moss. Once again, the townspeople are a bunch of morons who seem to have escaped from a poor western. One thing that was with me was that a little girl is the first victim and it seems unusual for a movie in this era. There is also a pipe that smokes old lady who knows about werewolves, but no one listens to her.
