One of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I tried to look at this, I had the flu and I was pretty open to any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately, it was too much. How can so many fully-grown actors be in a movie? This movie makes porn look like European art film. Cast just speaks their lines without emotion; Special thanks to Charlie Snow's (Baldwin) soon-to-ex-wife who speaks of her divorce as the rest of us talk about the weather. Just awful (and fun). <br /> <br /> With lots of spirits and friends, this can just do it as background entertainment and get laughs like Ed Wood movies. The plot is a joke and a sound track from some naughty soap operas. Hopefully no one paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br />
