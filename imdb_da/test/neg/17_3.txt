May be the biggest disappointment I will see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who did not like Park's Oldboy, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance "is among the best movies I've seen in the 2000s. Therefore, I was really pleased to see this, especially as it received such positive reviews. Instead, I found film klich√©d and broke a bit if there was any new reason for the vampire genre. And although I can appreciate a bit of crazy humor in movies like this, I felt that Park did it in very inconvenient times. Others have compared / opposed this to "let the right one in" and I have to say that "Let the right one in" was far better than this and was a fresh take on the vampire genre. Unfortunately, the park's features were tired.
