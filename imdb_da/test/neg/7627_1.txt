Forgive me, but this work of director Peter Hall is terrible. If you can't come to us with the plot, why not kill a person's cat or a dog. It certainly reaches the audience. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for a plot of a movie. And believe me, I saw it before she opened the package. How predictable you can get. Take a cute animal and kill it in a cruel way. I've never been a fan of De Mornay, and this show tells me why. Oddly and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, I found her rather stupid and certainly boring. I liked Banderas, but felt bad that he had to play opposite De Mornay. He has done much better in other films, "Philadelphia", where he had some honesty in his dialogue. In this chestnut he did his best to keep his character genuine. But the authors, Green & Rush, did a great job of preventing this with their trite history and irrevocable dialogue. Let's not be exposed to this kind of entertainment. Some of us are not fooled by corny plots, bludgeoning animals and generally lengthy dialogue. Seeing her get away with it made me furious.
