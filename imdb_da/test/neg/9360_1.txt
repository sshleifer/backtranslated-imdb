I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore. I think a lot of Mormons flooded the site and voted for it. This is not an artistic film, it is Mormon's propaganda. There is nothing wrong with it, but the plot's outline and the way it is described are completely misleading. If you are a Christian Bible or a Mormon, watch this movie, you will love it and think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, don't bother, the story is so constructed, random things happen that really don't follow in a coherent way. This guy tries to commit suicide because he sleeps with his neighbor. Are you kidding? What a pussy! Anyways it's a horrible movie.
