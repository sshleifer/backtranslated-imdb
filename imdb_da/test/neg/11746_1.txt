Okay, first of all, who in their real mind would recreate Hitchcock and secondly, who would make it shot? I admit that I had not intended to ever see this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and it just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I saw it because my boyfriend wanted to compare it to the original, and we both agreed less than five minutes into this shit that it was terrible. First, as mentioned, they shot it for shots. Where is originality? Why re-record a movie that is almost perfect, EXACTLY the way it was first made? Why resume such a movie at first? If you want to rework something, replay something that doesn't work and does it better! <br /> <br /> Second, they used exactly the same script from the 1960 version. The dialogue no longer works. It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch did not write the script you could have rewritten. <br /> <br /> This movie had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitating the original actors. The actor who played the car's salesman thought he just played John Anderson's performance as a car dealer in the original. All the actors thought the only direction they were given was the characters of the original film. Vince Vaughn may have been a little more frightened than Anthony Perkins, but in that connection you lose the sympathy that you have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion's dress went too far and lost the innocence of the character, as I think Tony Perkins caught so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying, and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. Her lines came out as someone desperate rather than just young and fun as Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the movie was that Gus Van Sant could open the movie with the shot that Hitch had imagined. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot over Phoenix, but could not at that time so he had to settle for a series of shots across each other. This film met the vision of a helicopter shot in the hotel's window. Then, the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful movie, you should see this but under no circumstances watch before you see the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been green-lit. Stick to the master's film, not the imitation.
