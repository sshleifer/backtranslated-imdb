Ok, I'm usually pretty open minded about movies. I can usually see a good page on a movie that has been totally pandered by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I won't waste too much energy telling you what's happening, but think of Bill, and Ted meets the worst Police Academy movie out of them all and you wonâ€™t be far away. What really made me hear about this movie was the stupid, purile racism that was evident everywhere. The general theme of latino / black guys = cool, white guys = lame is a bit entertaining for the first few jokes, but when the same joke has been repeated for the 500th (not an exaggeration by the way) it becomes both tiring and offensive. <br /> <br /> I spent months waiting for Karma's laws to come back to John Leguizamo for this movie. I had almost given up hope as "My VH1 Awards" was screened live in the UK. What followed was Mr Leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage. You have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him. Ahem. Ha! Ha! Ha!
