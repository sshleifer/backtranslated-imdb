Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about an uptight cook played by Zeta-Jones, who ends up wearing her niece when her sister is killed in a car accident. While she is taking care of family relationships, she is replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> Ufunny maudlin story without chemistry between the managers (she's a dead fish, but he's okay, but not much of anything). When I looked at this, I wondered why anyone would want to see this, as Zeta-Jones' character is so unlikely. Come on, she is so obsessed with cooking and being the best she does is to cook for her therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I will not use any of the many sayings that come to mind. I couldn't finish it.
