The show is at least partially faked (it's not reality, just pretends to be reality), which makes me think that at least someone without the face blurred out is a fake episode. Evidence in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there, can be seen as his boat is approaching. <br /> <br /> Actors playing "ambulance officers" did not remove their shirt or exposed wounds anyway, so they work on it, which would never happen. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and didn't drive up to the Emergency entrance (which doesn't make sense unless it's false and they wouldn't be allowed to go there)
