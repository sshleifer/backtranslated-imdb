Now I had the chance to watch this movie the other day. I didn't know what to expect since I never saw the trailer and such ... but what I simply discovered by seeing the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I have ever had the accident to see. <Br /> <br /> I wish I could give it this movie a 0 rating. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as it went to the party scene, I would just get into the coma, it was really badly done. The actors didn't have any direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews that say it's good if you have a small child to entertain for 90 minutes etc ... but really why should we expose children to this type movie ? At best, it has bad humor, rude and raw comedy and focuses on bad special effects to fill 80% of its time. I'm sure a few people in Hollywood will be out in the street after this movie bomb. <br /> <br /> Also, how can 39 people give this movie a 10. I think getting real someone giving this movie a 10 either has some mental problem and or works for the film industry. This movie should average 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10 because of the people who ranked it 10. Really sad.
