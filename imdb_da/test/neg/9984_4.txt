Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics such as 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (The style of film production was out of favor in the late 70s). Rather, it looks like a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, it does shorten the 150 minute version. I've never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it seems to be closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a video nasty. As one would expect of a movie produced by the 'Penthouse' publisher, there is a lot of naked flesh to watch, and the film contains lovingly catalogs of Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What may be unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely linked to the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as a woman on display and clearly homoerotic overtones to many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by a uniform obsession with violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with a stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film must be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a gory must be called 'Gore'). Characters are killed or mutilated in a number of sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. <br /> <br /> Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their confused lifestyle, so the film's focus on sex and violence is not necessarily historically incorrect. However, I wonder if such a concentration is needed to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both "Roman Empire's Fall" and "Gladiator" were put under Commodus government, an emperor, as cruel and legal as Caligula. In no case did the filmmakers find it necessary to transform their films into a mix of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both films are artistically far superior to 'Caligula'. <Br /> <br /> The action in the movie is not very bad, with a few exceptions like the terrible tree Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes an appropriate crazy Caligula. (Appropriate, that is, in conjunction with this film. The real Caligula was undoubtedly both cruel and eccentric, but historians have discussed whether he was actually mentally ill). The big mystery is exactly why so many prominent British actors should have agreed to participate in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only lady in the British Empire with a past as a porn star), it was probably associated with her rather regrettable tendency to switch between highbrow and the sleazy, but the sky alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud believed , they're doing. Unlike some other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always watch the movie at home, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of Nerva's role, a decent and honest senator of the old school. Unfortunately, any attempt at dignity in the context of this movie is like a gem on a dunghill. <br /> <br /> Guccione was clearly in his ambition to make this movie something of a cult classic of decadence. (About Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for the film to be open to questions). However, the film does not succeed at any other level, either as an art cinema or as a study of dictatorship. Even seen as eroticism is the second rate. 4.10
