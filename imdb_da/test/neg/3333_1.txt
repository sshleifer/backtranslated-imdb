A ridiculous movie, a horrible editing job, the worst act, ridiculous play, a story that is totally incomprehensible ... If God were to decide whether movies should continue to be done, judging by this, the whole world film industry would now be dead .. A wonderful movie showing that the cinema should not be made by people who "think" they can make movies. <br /> <br /> I'm still wondering who are the two gipsy girls that appear in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us ... <br /> <br />
