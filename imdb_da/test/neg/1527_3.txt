The topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban sprawl, public transport, oil and gas depletion, energy dependency, alternative energy sources, etc. The problem is that this is a clean and shameless propaganda piece. A viewpoint is presented, then hammered on the viewer over and over again. You see that the same handful of "experts" repeatedly do their thing. The supposed "narrator" begins to sound like a news reporter, but eventually he even discards the film's dogma. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the film is not so bleak and doomed about oil depletion, but the feeling that the people of the film are actually desirable for a postal oil community and all that involves. They paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the independent local village model; Go to work, shop locally, grow our own food and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. For them, the post oil community seems to be a grand vision for a better world. It would definitely spell the end of globalization, and even better, the end of Walmart. I want to give them some credit to apply the actual math by revealing the weaknesses of several overarching alternative sources of energy, including ethanol and hydrogen. I gave it 3 stars because I appreciated the old recording and premise.
