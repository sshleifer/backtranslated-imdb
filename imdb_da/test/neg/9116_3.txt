Personally, I have seen it because of Lea Thompson's appearance, and I didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly I kept it in the eye. Let's see it - it's just one of saga-like stories and is not very original or entertaining, but weird it just keeps you on the TV. My opinion of the will of their own would be much better if there wasn't a point I just didn't get. <br /> <br /> There is a lovely and truly touching scene where Lea Thompson's character runs in the street holding baby in her arms, the snow falling, she is cold, scared, and has no place to live, she doesn't know what they must do next time. And then approx. 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same child without warning to take the career she dreamed of. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand - I can't see how it's possible that she would do something like that, it was the opposite of everything she did so far in her life, since all She did was aimed at the child's survival. After this character flip I just couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie.
