I understand that Roger Corman loves to make things cheap, but it's just sad. I bought this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after seeing the original Carnosaur. I was blown away It was the same damned movie, with just some Corbin Bernese splashed in! It reminded me of all the 80's ninja movies that took old Kung Fu movies and spliced ​​into a bunch of white ninjas who drove wagon wheels with the word "ninja" written on their headbands (if you haven't seen them, then check "Ninja Terminator", "The Thundering Ninja", "Black Dragon" and "Ninja Warriors"). Thanks to Roger Corman; You just made me waste a dollar.
