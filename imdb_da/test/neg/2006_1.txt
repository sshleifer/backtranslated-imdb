Hi if people thought ed wood was a bad instructor then they have not seen this movie. I think there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast. Shoddy special effects. I think I can't believe this movie came from a Hollywood study. A high school drama club could probably come out with a better product. I think they had Erika Eleniak, who is beautiful Casper van Dien and under rated actor. Their agents must be shot to ask them to log on to this dribble, they do not read the writings. I still can't believe that small lists were a survivor in the movie. I always kept my head on why he and not a descendant of Van Helsing were the last man standing. I am a fan of vampire movies, and it is by far the worst thing they should do, so it will never see the light of day.
