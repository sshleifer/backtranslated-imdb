It is important to remember the real meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a true story" when you see Pride. It's like "You can save up to 50%" which can quite literally be translated into "You can't save more than 50%." It sounds good until you realize that the bottom of "up to" is "zero". Similarly, "inspired by a true story" means that someone heard a story, and that made them think about it. The only certainty is that the real story and the one you are seeing is not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There is a real Jim Ellis who started coaching the swimming team at the Philadelphia Department of Recreation in the early 1970s, but I have the feeling that the real Jim Ellis must not have been able to hide some feelings of disappointment in the way the movie appeared. Obviously, it takes wild freedoms with the story of his life, and I can only see him respond to his friends' strange looks, wondering why the film is so much different from the man they know. One thing that he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by Terrence Howard, one of our finest actors starring with Bernie Mac, who, despite the lack of an original and strong story, still provides a profound and moving performance. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the 1970s Philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and the trained and professional Jim Ellis, who is also a successful swimmer, finds it difficult to find one valuable teaching position until finally referred to a waiver of recreation center, which he is tasked with clearing up before his demolition. We can certainly understand his sense of belittlement. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Elston, the maintenance man (Bernie Mac), he is a disillusioned grump sitting in his office surrounded by piles of junk touching the ceiling and watching television at daytime on an old dusty television . Needless to say, when Jim turns out to clean the place and clean it out, Elston is not really kind to him. He knew his rec center was closed, and all his anger over it transferred quite smoothly to Jim. <br /> <br /> Given its past as the college swims, Jim takes a special interest in the pool, which he cleans and fills and brings to the top. A group of black teens who play basketball just outside the box, take interest in the pool when their basket rims are taken away, and the heat stays swell, and soon the group has an evolving swim team on their hands as they enter a citywide swim meet . Calling them underdogs, of course, would be an understatement. They are disorganized, unprofessional, inadequately educated and have no idea how to behave in a swim. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, of course. The movie is your standard underdog sporting story, so the first athletic excursion is totally insignificant as something other than a learning experience, a catalyst to run their much harder and more focused training that will lead to the final athletic excursion that issue. Now, the only thing a sports movie is about is that the protagonist (s) don't have to win at the movie's climax, we only need to understand the meaning and importance of their action. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie has the entire character development of an old Seagal movie. The good people are the good ones because they just have to be, and the bad ones are the ugly white swimmers who laugh and frighten and make racist jokes in our team. Oh, and there's a scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys under the water in the middle of a race. I didn't know it was really possible to kick someone underwater as such, but you get the idea of ​​how deep character development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of children Jim Ellis beat out of the street, doing nothing about their lives and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers, but We do not really know who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real statements made by the movie are that the efforts and the organization lead to success and racism is poor. Both of these are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone, it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary. Racism was so much more powerful in America in the 1970s that it felt like a huge loss that the movie dealt directly with that problem, but didn't really say anything about it. It's a kind of good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much it should have said is much bigger than what it said, the emotional feeling becomes a sad disappointment.
