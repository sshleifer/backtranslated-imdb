I've seen this movie over and over since it first came out. I was fifteen and even then I knew it was cheesy. It had such great potential and I constantly transform the script into my head. Capoeira destroyed what could have been a good drama. I loved the fact that it was shot on the spot. Too bad the signs were underdeveloped. It is as if they wrote a first draft of a script, then made the movie immediately. By fifteen I could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogue seemed to come out of nothing and you were left with many unanswered questions. And was it just me, or did it think Lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena has grown into a kind of woman!" And the way he always touched her. Wanted an interesting plot twist, Elena works for her drug trafficking cousin, who is also a perv. Too bad they missed the mark on this one.
