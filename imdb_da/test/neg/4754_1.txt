The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you have to forgive it because it is nicely violent. No, you shouldn't. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but how I can "destroy" this rat movie, I have no idea. Although you are a dead hard Alien / Pred fan that I wait for the DVD. It is not worth a 3.99 rental either, but you will be much less inclined to really hate this movie if you pay it than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession at a theater. <br /> <br /> In theater I saw AVPr there were exactly two laughs, both of a girl sitting next to me. Apart from that, there was total silence throughout. No ooohs, or "it was bad ass!" Nothing. Imagine being a patient on a desk and just getting stunned. Now you know what you want to feel in the theater after the AVP's opening scene. <br /> <br /> What was the budget for this movie? Like World of Warcraft, MI 3 and other f / x-driven movies, the director seems much more involved in what CGI people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. Spielberg has tried and failed on this several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Sure the movies make money, but should they? World of War and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent script, Tom Cruise et al, and the SS itself, but were still terrible. I'm sure the AVP wasted 90% of their budget on the CG and had no choice but to hire any actor who would say yes, even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors randomly. <br /> <br /> There is no excitement developed in any scene, so we are never close to being surprised. Who cares about who gets killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when lil aliens do their bodily output, we all know that the blood is acidic. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection and even AVP, the directors use the fact that aliens can think, hide, and can trap. This instructor decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots to develop characters that you would actually see either live or be killed. At this rate, you will never worry about who lives or dies, not a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters only serve one purpose in this movie to die. The opening scenes state that the movie should be a predictable joke. The character development scenes blend clich√©s, bad humor, and bad acting and dumb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they are killed as long as they die in never before seen ways. But they don't. The director tried to do something different from those that preceded him in the Alien franchise, but only managed to discard the good parts of the first movies, human protagonists, and steal the rest from other recent sci-fi movies. <br /> There is no original use of either the Alien or Pred characters. In fact, Pred has little trouble killing foreigners by the dozen, although the last film led us to believe that Pred honored foreigners as such a deadly enemy that they used the killing of a Rite of Passage. AlienPred is never really developed as a terrible creature. Its ability to inject parasites into a host is torn from several different films. Lately, it was probably Hellboy, where Samiel's dismembered-heavy injected eggs in Hellboy or Doom, where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues after they spit a victim's neck. <br /> Simply put, we have no reason to care about anything in this movie. There is violence, but it is not shock or surprise and is nothing that has not been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. CG is OK, and both foreigners are made to see and move as they have in film past. But since the characters never develop and the play is so bad, we hope they all die. The little girl was probably the best actor of the pile, but unfortunately we are not ready to care about whether children, women or others live or die. We just want the movie to end. Eventually, it does, but not before another stolen line from Resident Evil 2 has a key goal of Gunnison's way of eradicating "infection". And not yet another stupid scene to open the door for further successors, but does it? In a movie filled with bad scenes, the worst may have been saved lately. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but everything is about to repeat: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, creepy action, decent f / x wasted due to the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I don't mind going to an indie movie and being disappointed. The actors and directors and the crew are likely to get their career working on a shoestring budget. For a movie with this type of budget and hype I feel cheated along with disappointed. This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening stage to closing credits. Sad to say that an example of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 so once not so good.
