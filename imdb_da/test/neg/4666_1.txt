I can't remember when I've seen a worse movie. The action was exceeded, the dialogue trite to the point of being painful to listen to, the special effects second-rate and the overall story ridiculous. I never wanted to go on a movie anymore and if I had been alone it was what I had done about 30 minutes in it and saved me almost another two expanding hours of nausea-inducing dialogue and a plot with more holes than a Swiss cheese "the size of texas." I just can't overemphasize what a miserable experience sat through this colossal waste of perfectly good celluloid was. <br /> <br />
