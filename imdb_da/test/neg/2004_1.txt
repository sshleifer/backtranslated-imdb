I will not repeat what so many others have said about this movie; I will try to add a few new points. Coolio-as-vampire piece is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the Blondie song "No Exit" where he assumes the role of a rapping vampire (it actually works as a musical concept and is actually a great song) . Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more beautiful. And what really goes for a Brad Pitt movie for anything other than eye cans? Same here, though this is poorly filmed (check out "Starship Troopers" instead). And of course Udo Kier, after playing Dracula in Morrissey / Warhol movies, has a little more than a cameo. Enjoy it if you can.
