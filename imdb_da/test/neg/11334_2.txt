!!! Spoiler alert !!! <br /> <br /> Pointe, however, did not think that this movie had an end to destroy ... I only began to see it in the middle after Matt had entered Sarah's body, but then I am fascinated by the plot's bizarreness, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and couldn't see how Matt wld ends up being happy. What about his fiancee? At one point it looked as if he would come up with his best friend, certainly icky and wrong ... and then the whole "also no matter what" thing doesn't seem like a touching buddy-buddy phrase, it's just ridiculous ... Was he also not likely to come back to life? And yet how can he live like a woman? and then came the movie just above it by finishing and not explaining anything at all !!!!! What is it about ??? I was so cross, wasted an entire hour in my life for no reason! :) but was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, so swings and roundabouts
