This was a crazy, miserably acted movie based on sublimated male fantasies. A shame that it was based in Texas, an otherwise excellent state. I would recommend this movie to anyone, and wish it never got into my consciousness as I am now so irritated that I spilled my brain cells, even paying the least attention.
