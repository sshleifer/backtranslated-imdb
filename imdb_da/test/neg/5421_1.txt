Oh boy! I really waste Manhunt in Space. I think this flop deserved rates worse than Manhunt. It goes nowhere and the fungal growth was more exciting than this tripe. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanta. She's so misunderstood. Smug Rocky stiffens around and fortunately there is no mention of Winky about his "gay nightlife". There is much more to talk about, a really awful (to see) space weddings on the rocks and crappy space cut-outs. Then there's Bobby. You decide who is more annoying: Bobby or Winkster? Personally, I would jettison them out of an airlock in a black hole, not until they first exposed them to kill meat that eats foreign mutants. <br /> <br /> At least there is Vena. She's just a cosmic girl!
