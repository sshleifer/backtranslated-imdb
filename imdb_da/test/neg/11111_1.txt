Oh my God ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist". Special Note: A Horror B movie must have at least one sex scene. Don't even expect a hot girl in this. With the unpredictable mistake I must start with the complete bash. First of all, if you are going to make a Horror monster movie, you need to spend a lot of the budget to create a "cool" monster outfit. The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. There is no way Chupacabras (yes it is spelled) looks threatening in the movie. There is an actor in a Halloween outfit thank you! it looks so cheap it makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Second, the gore effects are the spinal cord for anyone directly into the video monster Horror movie. Again, the producers decided not to use for decent gore effects. The blood looks wrong! Take a look at the guy being cut in half. It's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts about ten seconds. The end is a very bad scene that does not leave you satisfied. <br /> <br /> The action is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kinds of movies; but in this movie it is beyond terrible. A cast nobody without any experience makes fun of himself for about 85 minutes. Special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair trying to convince SWAT members that he is ill. The cough he fakes is more than ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor ever in a B-Horror movie, no fun. Also, Captain Pe√±a delivers a horrible performance in the first ten minutes of the girl. <br /> <br /> The true story behind Chupacabras is not even told. All you are told is that the monster sucks the goat's blood. Why bother with this piece of shit? Plesae, don't even see it yourself if you have the chance. Not even if it is aired on cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support low-budget Horror movies because at least they involved trying to do something "different" than Hollywood, but that doesn't mean Horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage.
