I watched this movie when it came out. Let me see now - this guy who had previously divorced Mount Fuji, manages to fund the financing and hire staff to document what sounds like a bold and bold act --- standing at the highest peak of the world. Well - and here comes the SPOILER - what happens, see, after a large crew member has managed to help him get close to the top - and a life is lost in the bargain - he gets on his skis, manages to put it down a very very short way, after which his PARACHUTE OPENS ... and that's it. And instead of burning the footage to hide this incredibly anti-slime end to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. SPOILER ENDS I admire the great courage and effort it must have taken the movie staff to get some of the amazing shots they got. ANOTHER SPOILS - Oh yes, one of Sherpas is killed by falling into a crack. The narrator who quotes the "guardian" tells randomly that, according to his Sherpa religion, since this man's body cannot be restored, his soul will move the world forever and never know rest. Worth it, the narrator tells. he answers - because it served the purpose of letting this clown "ski down to Everest." I can't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid. This is one to miss at all costs.
