I watched this movie and became more and more sad about the stupid plot that went nowhere when suddenly the story takes a surrealistic turn to worse and has an actor playing himself. Oh how I guffawed. Because it's so much fun, isn't it? We know that Julia Roberts plays Tess's character, and here they are in the film, joke that Tess's character looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone who publishes Julia. How well she does, we never know because 99.999% of the audience doesn't know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine doesn't count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis turns up! Apparently he is Julia Robert's best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how would I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts themselves know each other? I am especially interested in the personal life of the actors - I just pay my money and expect them to do the work they are paid to do. In any case, they start to crack jokes about the plot twist in the movie, where Willis (rather convincingly) plays a psychiatrist ... the one with that little child in it ... do you know that one? I don't, I've forgotten what it's called. Willis even commented on how well that film did at the cashier's office - how modest you were to Mr Willis! The problem is that these scenes are not only meaningless and terribly horrible self-pleasing, it also reminds us of the viewers that we are simply looking at a bunch of actors who roam and pay big sums of money for very little effort. You see, when I see a movie, I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I'm watching actors - I want to believe in the story I am looking at. When you begin to drag the scene down midway, you simply destroy the illusion of me. You know that a television series has jumped in the shark when it begins to introduce celebrities, play itself (get up and stand counted The Simpsons, Friends, etc.), but this is the first time I've seen a movie Jump over the shark. I usually keep away from movies as such (for example, scary movies, the naked gun, etc.). The problem is, I never thought Oceana's 11 movies would go in that direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So with the suspension of disbelief being thrown out of the window and the plot now dormant in the movie then the most wicked joke of everyone in the audience cracks - the hoist actually went far back in history and the last 90 minutes or so The film was meaningless. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actress friends stand up, point to the audience and say, "Ha haaa ... you've all been ... thank you for your money!" Then they give us the one-finger salute. <br /> <br /> Right back to you. Actually, I didn't pay to watch this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How do they have apples? Now it's a plot twist.
