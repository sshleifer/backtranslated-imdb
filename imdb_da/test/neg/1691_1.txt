Classic author C.S. Lewis once wrote that no children's story is worth reading, seeing, etc., if only children can enjoy it. I would say that this film is easy to hold up as the defense of his argument. About five or six years ago I loved it, traced it only three or four years later and found it to be wet, poorly animated, dully and confusingly written, and with distressed repetitive and horrible songs (I see you, hey-cockalorum) that Shows a production that is aimed at merry pity and whim, but which results in a nasty, two, frustrating mess. <br /> <br /> Show with all this to your child, but I'd highly recommend that you don't buy a copy or try to sit on the screen. If you want something put in the same era but with true charm and white, go for 'Oliver Twist' or the BBC's brilliant adaptation of 'The Box of Delights'.
