The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen the allot. The action is horrible, the plot is horrible, the idea is horrible, and no research was done, what ever is! Okay, I admit that "Air Bud" was a pretty good movie, but not "Soccer Dog". This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play football? Even for 10-year-olds, kicking the ball hard enough to slow the stupid dog in half will not be a problem! It's terrible, don't watch this movie.
