When I watched this movie, I think I was a freshman in high school, and I still want to charge Master P for an hour and 20 minutes or so from my life that I will never come back. <br /> <br /> The guy who has already been created is quite right. Master P is a wannabe mobster. Like all other rappers in this country, he looked at millions of rap CDs for young, imposing white children in this country. It is commonly known that the mob was not a black thing, and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. Unfair as it may be rappers can't deal with. This movie paints Master P as a mobster named Nino? The script is horrible with the actor who matches. Completely unbelievable. During the search I came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called "The Black Sopranos" !!!! <br /> <br /> Let's save it and stick to Nickalodeon. You're not a white mobster, you're not even a good actor, master P, stick to your music for the one listening to it these days ...
