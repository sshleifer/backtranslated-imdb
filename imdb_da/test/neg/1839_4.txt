This relatively unclear Hong Kong "minipiece" is the perfect desert movie for the video age that looks toms (at least the first half is). Every setup, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look up at a girl's drive, stare at her breasts, stare at her bottom and learn from her tight steps. What it is to establish is the protagonist's perverted proclivities, of course (!) <br /> <br /> Genre stalwart Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man afflicted with erotic daydreams and monstrous fantasies. Everyone involves sharply dressed, sexy Chinese ladies with nothing but sexual origin on their minds. The plot is thickened by a homicid subplot, voodoo doll and a small rape and plunder. <br /> <br /> Some of the sex scenes are pretty hot and gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced in the other half feel half-baked and plot development is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the manufacturer of garish waste Wong Jing was in a terrible hurry to get this in and out of the theaters. <br /> <br /> The arty title sequence did not fool on this jaded punter.
