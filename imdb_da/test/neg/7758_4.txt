1960s kid show with ex-vaudevillians playing handy men for rent. As you can expect, they are a disaster in everything they do. During the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for 15-minute time slot advertising), they do things like creating a fence between warring neighbors, helping a magician on stage and dealing with a found trunk and wallet. /> I never grew up over this show (which seems to have been shot in New York). I thought I'd run heard of or seen a majority of children's shows from the period either by having seen them as a child or seen them on nostalgia conventions. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD, I had been totally unaware of its existence. <br /> <br /> The show plays like the three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello made by people leaving the routine. (In fact, one of the couples claims to have created the legendary "slow I turned ..." routine that Abbott and Costello perfected). It's not bad, but it's really not good either, as everything works out. The time is often off (although it may be due to poor direction) and the jokes were reused year before the show first ran. Odds have you seen it all before. On the plus side, this is the kind of thing that would be perfect for introducing very young children to the magical vaudeville style comedy, but it will be to try for parents to pass through even with the short episodes. <br /> <br /> Only for nostalgia junkies. Everyone else should look to see an Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges original.
