I can't believe how stupid this movie really is. The story (written by Keira Knightley's mother) is what destroys the movie to the limit. It is just boring, absurd and makes absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> This movie hit so badly for most of it, especially in the beginning. The story just continued and continues about their daily flirting with each other, often times as a trio. in this movie you have an annoying deadly couple (the poet and his wife) who are complete queens from the start. wife sleeps with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a perver who thrives on cheap angry and women. wife, who waaayyyyyy too quickly become friends with her former childhood carer (the game of keira) suddenly becomes jealous, knowing well that the two were lovers when they were children. something doesn't seem right here .... i mean, come on ... come with the program lady! what you expect. The bottom line is: Former lovers meet again with new wife who encloses it, becomes so envious, so formerly married women and her husband becomes jealous, bombarding the crazy, drunk couple's home, crazy man calls the police and they end up going the right of a man's attempt at murder charges. it is summed up in a nutshell ... this movie had its moments like quality and good play by cillian murphy, but apart from that, i can't believe i saw it ... i complained about it under the movie and some family members who looked at me, fell asleep. I decided to give it a try and I should have attached to my first instincts.
