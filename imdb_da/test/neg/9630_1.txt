There are no saving graces in this terrible, stagey, boring snooze party that brings in mind "Ransom of Red Chief"! <br /> <br /> Although there are some great stars in this movie, the play is almost uniformly horrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, who is usually a retired kind of guy, is hammered up with compulsory feeling. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so top-notch as to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is terribly dissatisfied and horrible. <br /> <br /> The son is such a repulsive little abrupt, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively small role the butler has. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too hard on the actors, after all, all they did was read the lines that were given to them in the script. Oh, the manuscript, the toughest piece of twisted boy who wants to draw on your heartbeats, but just turns your stomach.
