It takes forever for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based movie to finally get out of the starting block. Ca. Half an hour is spent on unnecessary introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant, small personal issues that can enchant housewives and apathetic retirees in dreary dramas, but this must be the horror genre (or I thought naively). Mutt fails to see all the terrible things that Leonard Maltin, the infamous / hopeless and always laughing film critic, would disagree with: he considers Cujo to be "really scary". (I often have to ask myself if Maltin is really thick - or just likes to make favors for his Hollywood friends ...) It is both illogical and inconsistent that Wallace survives an attack with only one leg injury. And of course her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror movie clich√©s; Trust the King to use it for minimal effect. The prerequisite is carefree, too banal, even for a horror movie: a rabid boy attacks a family. Is that all? This kind of thing barely constitutes a 3-minute sub-part plot in your average zombie movie. I think that even Cujo must have discovered that he was the lead in a turkey. Mutts have horrible agents ... But what I really don't understand is how people can actually throw themselves in the "Cujo" book and read it from cover to cover? These SK fans must be immortal: that is the only explanation, ie. why they treat time as such a meaningless product. <br /> <br /> Bodycount: 3.
