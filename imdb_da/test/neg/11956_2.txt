This is an excellent example of a very bad B movie. There are worse movies than this (Titanic for example), but it certainly shares the pile of steaming crap movies. OK, it was apparently shot in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so paralyzed. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and is even more boring than him! I didn't even think it was possible! In fact, he and the maid of the film are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER! It is not just what is acting waaaaaaaaay over dramatically, yes it was, of course, the writing that was terrible, combining for a deadly one-two battle into a terribly utterly incomprehensible drama. The bird scare, let's talk about him. The whistle you hear every time he is around is stupid and obviously dubbed. Now his costume, I can't get over it - it's a guy wearing jumping sacks and a stupid mask! I'm simply dumbfounded, maybe if your 3 year old with brain damage you would be afraid of him / it. <br /> <br /> One of the characters that the token black guy actually used the line: "This can be a chance to earn my red wings" when referring to trying to score with one of the girls in his period. Wow, yes, that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to. <br /> <br /> At first, when the gently dressed girl runs through the corn, why is it roped off? I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be clear, just one of the many obvious errors in this whole 'movie'. Another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (that's right), everything on the beach and one dorkaziod stands up to singing a song and playing the guitar for everyone, and so clearly called it fun. Fortunately, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy's chest when he finishes singing. All in all, doing so is good, it is one of those movies when you praise these people for being killed by the killer. OK, there is a scene where the two guys bury one of their friends in the sand, then get up, whip out their penis and urinate over the guy in the sand. Who does this? Really, imagine it "Hey, let's bury joe in the sand, then get up and take our genitals out as it is, and piss on him." In fact, this is the gay eroticism of this movie, what the hell? A good part of the start of this movie is the jocks standing there in underwear in the wardrobe and corn field while killing. What the hell is that about? Traditionally, in movies and in reality, the jocks do not get the girls and the nerds. It really does not make sense, since all geeks think of, are girls and sex, and apparently everyone jocks being sports and being around each other in their underwear, I can't get it. <br /> <br /> Lets came to the meat. As one who saw this movie with me, it said, "I've never been so disgusted with heterosexual sex in my life" and that's true. If you like hot A cup action, or nasty old female boobs, then this movie is for you. I swear they have found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and that is who they get to make the naked scene ?? Then the ugly old woman nurse shows her jumps a few times, and man, I just wouldn't see it. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm talking about the continuity of the timeline to this movie, that's really just bizarre. It starts during the day, so they all go to the corn field and within 2 minutes it is immediately dark in the middle of the night as they drive out and say they go to the beach - it is instant again and apparently they stay on the beach until night again, and until day the next day. So basically these events are in the movie in 4 days without any of the characters needing to sleep or something, it's really weird. After the main killings have taken place, it flashes forward to '3 weeks later' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! The surviving people literally pop some champaign! And that was when I realized that the budget didn't go to the script, instruct or act, it all went to the freakin bottle of champaign. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now if you don't want the end spoiled for you, it's really fun. OK, so the ending takes place in a church, and scarecrow puts his soul into the diabetes child's body, then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy, and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in the star war! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So in some way in the middle of the fight, the scarecrow's souls fight into the guttenberg jr. guy, and then with the last amount of will he has of himself, he adorns on a cross in the church! It is fantastic! Some blood, but what's even better that the cross is of course pap! You can see the bottom moving away from the ground! Wow, yes it has fun watching.
