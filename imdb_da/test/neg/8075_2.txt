Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no complaints, right? So why give Stooges only 96 minutes? I don't ask for a PBS mini-series, but would a two party have killed anyone? The movie steamed over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. I want to give a salute to the star performances ... they had a hard work because they didn't really look like Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I took a tape out of American movie classics who had the right deal on it and laughed myself silly. The movie was pretty hard emotionally, especially after Curly's stroke and Moe has to keep the business going. When Curley started crying, I lost it ... As I said, the movie was good but could have been and should have been much, much better. Maybe it's appropriate ... Stooges was ripped off when they lived and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
