Unfortunately, this movie was horrible. Clich√©d, hackneyed, silent dialogue and actress make it almost unmatched. <br /> <br /> The sensitive finale is ridiculous lame. <br /> <br /> There is reason why Judge Reinhold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York and are not Jewish, more of the jokes will be uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I also found the need to get the unconscious lesbian daughter to end up insulting at the end. <br /> <br /> I just can't understand how this movie was so popular in movie festivals. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen for some time.
