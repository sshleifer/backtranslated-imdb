MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is an OK time killer. It has a uniformly attractive throw, the action is rarely boring. There are many killings. And the production values ​​are not bad. But in the end, it plays as a standard television episode from the 1970s with some nudity thrown in. The film is the end product of a "writer" trying to make a purely commercial film. There is very little depth here and the movie spends too much time with chases and action scenes. Apart from the scene on the beach with the old man, MMBM is almost devoid of any frightening or excitement or fear. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> It can be seen even if it does not leave a lasting impression.
