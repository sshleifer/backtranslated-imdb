I know if I was a low budget film producer, I would probably check this page to find out what people are saying about it. So I really hope the filmmakers actually read this! I think you should find a way to repay me for one and a half of life, I just wasted seeing this waste. Please stop making movies about something you are probably fantasizing about. Just stop making movies together ... you're one of the reasons why it's so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big. Make the world a service and get a job a McDonalds or something so you can do something productive with your life! I want to call blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this movie in their store.
