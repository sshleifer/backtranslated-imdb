Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal mindset KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guess here. A giant CGI komodo dragon - it looks like a dog minus fur - takes a humongous CGI king cobra, with a bunch of wooden frames and others trapped between them. The wooden frames get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to an off-limits federal island. An experiment from a mad scientist in growing very large vegetables has become an attempt to grow very large critters, thanks to our nutty military. Now all that is left on the island is the very large critters and the mad scientist's small, well-made daughter. The group enters her at the old plantation laboratory, monsters arrive, and the hunt is on. If you see enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel flicks, you recognize some of the sets and locations of many other movies. Action is non-existent, just like the plot. At least you can enjoy watching the badly animated combo / dog stomp on the intended victims just before you dry them up. Cobra just beats and swallows. No imagination at all.
