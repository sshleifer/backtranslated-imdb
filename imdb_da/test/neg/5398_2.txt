This can include *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Where to start on this particular empty wasteland? Well, it would have been good if they actually had a plot. Acting talent, decent dialogue, excitement, humor, hi, even free sex would have helped this flick. Unfortunately, there were only a lot of gore (even that was not done well), shooting of automatic weapons and deficiencies. There was no need to attach the basic premise that an Indian damned to protect the body strain he murdered was being tracked by a Federal Special Ops team dressed in civvies (?). Most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of behavior in a Horror movie that differs from the group so you can be chosen one by one. You think this team would know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappear without a trace. When they finally realize that they are picked, they make one of several stands and only burn their weapons to hit the trees a lot. Tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money. <br /> <br /> When they do not shoot trees, they track this spirit that does not leave traces (who knows how to trace it) and spouting a lot of macho BS. By the way, do I mention that most of this team are women? Interesting to listen to them speaks hard. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can find better movies in the buyer at Kmart.
