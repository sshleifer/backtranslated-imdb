ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin off and not much more of the original Nickalodeon RUGRAT's comic strip, which featured the babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and later Kimi (Chuckie's sister) and Dill (Tommy's brother) . I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. It had excellent humor, good stories and the show's creators, Klasky & Csupo, were, of course, very original and creative with the concept of adventure of babies. The new show ALL GROWN UP tries to regain the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found the "completely grown" Chuckie just annoying and all "pre-teen-acting-mature / try-to-popular" used for (unfortunately) * all * of the characters bad and leached. There are still some fun scenes and jokes in the new series, and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby band of RUGRATS look ten years from their age in the original show. Overall, this show is 'fair' and only watchable if a) you are a deaf fan of RUGRATS, b) have never seen the original show c) you are a pre-teen who has nothing to do or d) you bored so that your somehow forced to see this show. This show is not that good. It does not compare with the older RUGRAT's episodes in quality, humor and anything else.
