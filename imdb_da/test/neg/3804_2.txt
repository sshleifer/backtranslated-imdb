... but apart from that, there is virtually no redeeming social value for this successor to the original Poseidon Adventure. Where the hell are all people from the original, including the rescue crew? Michael Caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (though he later crashes with Jaws 4 down the road). Slim Pickens is just as embarrassing as a Texas stereotype, and in general, one has to wonder: "Why did they bother?" Irwin Allen's last staff to redeem in the craze of the disaster, I assume.
