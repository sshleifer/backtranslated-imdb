This movie was quite painful for me to see. I understand that indie movies do not have the same resources as other mainstream movies. But there are basic elements in film making that you typically want to observe. First you have to jump down. There are many in the film's opening 15 minutes. There are shots where it appears that two separate shots of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is a sign that says a half line from a roof and the rest of the line is from another roof. Second, the dialogue. I understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Since this movie is very specific to its location, the dialogue must also be spoken in a particular tone (example: set a movie in Boston, but people use West Coast Hose with a Chicago accent). Even in understanding this, it is still difficult to sit through some of the lines that these actors present. It's just the two most lively issues I experienced with this movie. There were a few others. I don't mean to sound like a tough critic who doesn't know anything. I have many years of experience in the film (even more importantly the low-budget indie film) industry. I also understand that with many directors there is often a method for their madness. I have not been able to find the method used in this movie. It makes it difficult when I try to determine if I see this movie as an example of outstanding style in film making, or just another low budget, poorly composed movie. I honestly hope it is not the latter. If anyone has an idea of ​​why things are done in a particular way, or have their own thoughts / views on this movie, I'd like to hear them. Hopefully I can understand this movie more, and my current opinion can be changed.
