Let me first say that I really want to like this movie. Most of the time the actors and actors saw their parts and did quite well in their roles, but the film lacked any real plot. It seemed so wrapped up in seemingly "crazy" that no interesting story ever shone through. Also, the camera's work was often sloppy, trying snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. Most of the time was lap, which meant looking cool, even confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some of the characters were just stupid. The crazy beautiful boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OKAY. Overall, a fat smelly 1/10. Not worth your time.
