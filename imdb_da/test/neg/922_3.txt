Great ensemble cast but unfortunately, a lot of undeveloped ideas make the movie move. You do not feel satisfied at the end after waiting for some sort of conclusion, closure or at least an ironic twist. <br /> <br /> It had the well-known "Curb" feeling without dare saying it, Larry as annoyingly polar opposite. The music was there, "the show of nothing" scenes show up, but with no ordinary thread or excitement - it falls like a solo project that runs out of budget. Spoilers: The movie title speaks of cheese, but she prefers rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He just prefers any junk food, regardless of the seller by date. Maybe I want someone to eat 'cheese dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit, at least bound some scenes together. <br /> <br /> Marty: It's just not fun and exaggerated. People don't care about a show in a show. A coffee book table on coffee books was more fun. <br /> <br /> Unless you are big fans of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. It doesn't even have to be with anyone.
