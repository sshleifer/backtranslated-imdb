Like most people, I couldn't wait to see this Ocean's 11 sequel, but it really stinks I must say. It stinks because there is simply no good manuscript, it was just cheap. I hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made (or will do) to the tsunami in Asia, so this movie will have at least a good reason to exist. It's so bad that I can't write a decent comment about it myself, but .... I still advise the creators of this thing to make "Ocean's 13". Ocean's 13 will be around the same thieves trying to steal a manuscript well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign (perhaps Russian) scriptwriter who knows all the tricks of writing a copy of this well-hidden manuscript so they can replace the original they have to steal. Or they have to find at least 13 people to write a decent script for a movie where not only Julia Roberts plays himself, but also all the other stars of the Ocean's movies. 13 People because it is the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character.
