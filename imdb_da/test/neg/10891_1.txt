There are movies that are so bad they are good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop, which just never should have been made because they are just terrible. Bad acts, unlikely signs, predictable plot, and a seemingly supernatural twist that do not add to the story are all important failures. Some half-decent special effects are about the only thing worth noting. <br /> <br /> I can't even write myself a plot because everything I really want to do here warns you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this movie at all. It is 1.5 hours in your life you will never come back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
