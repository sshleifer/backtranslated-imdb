.. that separates good, memorable movies from movies like this. It is not entertaining, touching, fun, interesting and sometimes feels like a small sub-human. The principles are as if they are secondary in the worse way when they were related to each other and the audience. <br /> <br /> Starting out conventionally enough. Real children get a new car for the exam, but the dean says he cannot get the car after the ceremony. However, happiness goes on and stops in the afternoon on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels. Wise-asses waitress / girlfriend of head yokel. Chockingly they play chicken until they accidentally burn down in the dinner, they left three minutes earlier (aren't all diners five feet from the gas station?). They told them to pay the price in court, so the only reason to get this 'fish out of water' to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys should help rebuild dinner. Worse than the rich child in living with the family of the un-rich child .. in the room above the ceiling. The "room above the ceiling" has saved many a person in need of a bed .. Real child inexplicably treated well by the boyfriend who never mentions him that he nearly killed her. This does not sound good with his girlfriend and is never fully explained. You don't know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls for Kelley (Chris Klein) or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee is completely unacceptable, and Josh does not record much of an impression. The character with the most life is the judge who puts Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the dinner. She gets at least one funny note, which is more than anyone else does. Everyone is so amusing and humorous that you will feel a little herring if you think of smile while the movie is on. <br /> <br /> The end is a way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. I don't like throwing a movie that a little girl somewhere in the world can really love, but since I'm not one, I have to. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is not medieval, and although it is not forced, its innocence and homespun, corny dialogue comes from a good place. 10.4.
