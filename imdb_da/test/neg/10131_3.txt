The case is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s, starring to the then spouse of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as reluctant lovers. She has polio and leads an inclined existence as a pop songwriter. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and completely merged with her. Their affair, as it is, is doomed from the start and she knows it, but still goes along with it. Two things to look at if you are caught watching this: Woods Jane Fonda hairdresser, who never musses, no matter what, and a tune, she sings early in this terrible flick. She sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's classic padding between advertisements. It is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who makes Wood's singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery. Also keep an eye on all peasant tops and dresses. For comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with tightly cut hair and sporting a number of classic suits.
