I watched this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer, I was expecting a very stylish marshal art movie with lots of action and maybe a little plot to think about along the way. I was very disappointed as it seems that once you have seen the trailer, there is nothing else worth looking at (if you expect it is as described above). My boyfriend at that time gave up halfway through and while I continued to look in the hope that something interesting could happen ... did nothing. I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours in your life that you don't really worry about losing.
