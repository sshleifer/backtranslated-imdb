In this follow-up to The Naked Civil Servant, we see the last years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play that part?), And it is a role he moves to disappear. For me, Hurt is Crisp, and I have always found it very difficult to take the man himself, because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His body is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long friend and confidant. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, beyond the performances, the film has a little to recommend it. To be sure of the movie, the details get right. Filmed in and around the New York movie, the movie looks and feels like New York and the surrounding area, but dramatically the kind of inert. It is sharp to talk to people who are witty and are trying to express themselves with the world as it is (he ended up regretting some badly-worded AIDS words) and dealing with the weaknesses that the old age encountered. The Quentin man is always interesting, but his life as portrayed is really not. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the movie. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just wanted him to be better served by this movie about his life.
