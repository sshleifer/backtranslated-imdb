Lina McLaidlaw is a bright, lonely young woman who unexpectedly falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly qualified bachelor with a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost at the same time, Lina is exposed to Johnnie's dependence on lying, playing and getting into debt. Despite her mistakes, she cannot resist her charming way until she begins to suspect that he can have murderous thoughts against her ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, well-crafted with an attractive cast , a good script and possibly the only lousiest end in movie history. Okay, it may be too long, but not too much. Many movies change the end of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.), but the last two scenes of this are not only capable of being terribly paralyzed, but also making the entire previous plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and morality lacking - and what she knows about him - killing her. It should end (as it does in Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley's book before the facts) with him trying to murder her. The reason for this is not that the studio forced Hitch to revive the end, one of the first examples of the godly process of previewing the audience test. Hitch made sense and did what he was told (it was only his third movie in Hollywood), knowing that if he played the game, he would later or later get creative control over his films, shown by his masterpieces of 50s. But it still leaves us with a turkey of an end. It's a big shame because it's really a very good movie with an exciting theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife as well? The script is excellent, with many off-guard moments (like when Lina's father dies and Johnnie assumes she is crying about it), a fine doomed Grant performance (which never played a villain again) and fine photography throughout the culmination of famous glass-of-milk shot. Fontaine won an Oscar for this achievement, although I personally prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her former rival role in Rebecca. I would like to rate this movie higher, but I really can't forgive the ending; This is what happens when movies are made for money, not love, which I guess is the curious theme of the movie itself. Take a quick look at Hitchcock's cameo as a man sending a letter.
