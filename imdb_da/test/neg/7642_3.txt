I'm surprised at the number of people who have rated this post as their favorite "Chan" (so they didn't ever "... at the Opera" or "... at Treasure Island?" --- the latter ironically written by John Larkin, who dropped the ball here). This plot is a train wreck and overloaded with meaningless signs. First, viewers are obliged to remember Steve McBirney's sweden details (played by reverent thug and HUAC squealer Marc Lawrence) in 1929's murderous spree. Let's not forget that he escaped a capital murder on the courtyard with a lone policeman on his tail. There is also a victim who was fished out of a river 11 years earlier that no one ever seems worried about. Then, the suspension of disbelief is required when all the signs appear to be trapped in the wax museum (though inspector O'Matthews manages to carry his bold, wet rear end in through a window). Why is Joan Valerie (as Creams assistant) in this movie? She can't even handle pliers properly --- I'm aware that Chan suffers from the same boo-boo but yeesh, he's 66 years here - (and has less than 10 lines --- and her sign motivation is too weak for ever to be sufficient "splained (excuse me when I'm at a rant I write as Ricky Ricardo). Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) character is written as an avid widowed moron, apparently available only to the vapid romantic interest of horndog attorney Tom Agnew (played by the fret-faced Ted Osborne) Why is Willie Fern a sign? Why couldn't McBirney's henchmen pull the switch at 8:20 (not a spoiler, okay?!) One wonders how with IQ of lint he manages to dress yourself or why he hasn't walked in front of a bus years ago Toler himself gets a little more acting than usual (a plus) and the right kudos go to put designer Thomas Little and cinematographer Virgil Miller who created a really eerie atmosphere ... but this post has less logic than a Ritz Brothers movie. I'm so boggled by how a toothpick can be used as a blower gun.
