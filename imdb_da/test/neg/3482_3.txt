I'm surprised by the great comments here for this OK surf movie. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school to the barnyard for beach antics and is not really plausible. The idea that the lead child learns to ride a table So good in a concrete wave pool that he beats the real surfers by their game in the real sea, is just stupid. In Australia, where most urban teens surf, this movie was laughed at by the audience taking everything with a sea salt corn. Made in the 80s, but with the heart of the 60s, it's fun to see and see and sound good, but it's not a classical class at all. Even the actors did not leave this. We are seriously in LIQUID BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANK BINGO country here. Oz stars like Occy and BIG Wednesday hero Gerry Lopez is designed to add head nodding recognition to our farm boy's wave power, but it only made the audience in the cinema's guffaw. It is for 10 year olds who do not ask much. It is not even in the hands of God, and it was silly as well.
