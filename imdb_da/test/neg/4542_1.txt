Well, I like to see bad horror B-Movies because I find it interesting to see stupidity and the inability of creators to shoot seriously good movies. (I always compare these movies with - for example - some Spielberg's works and again and again do not understand the big difference in what I see.) I like Ed Woods movie because it's so unfortunate it is very funny. But people !!! "The Chilling" is not fun and is not even "interesting". It is extremely dreary horror movie without anything that even makes bad movies visible. There is no action, no manuscript, no direction, no tension and not even blood. It is extremely scary amateur movie. It is definitely the WORST movie I had ever seen (and I had seen a lot of "worst movie" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1.10
