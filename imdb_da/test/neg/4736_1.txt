I'm not even willing to vote a single star for this crap, but IMDb doesn't have zero as a rating option ... worst movie I've ever seen .. History of the movie 1. Predator ship crashes on the ground 2. A stranger and some face frames are released and they start killing people. 3. A predator comes to earth and he begins to kill foreigners and humans. 4. Then a human ray drops a bomb and kills people, aliens and predators. 5. Some people find the predator's shoulder gun. 6. The final directors should consider repaying money back to viewers. If you still want to watch this movie, download from some torrent sites and thank me for saving you money. All the film has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth, you see only dark shadows even in action scenes. too much violence. I didn't expect it from a fox movie
