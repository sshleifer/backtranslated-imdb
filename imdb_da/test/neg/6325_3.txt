If you read the plot overview for "Mad Max", you just destroyed the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You also found out that "Mad Max" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which would be useful because otherwise you have no idea what is happening. The film, made in 1979, really tries hard to be Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971), only that movie, in all its wonder, actually makes sense and leaves an influence. This movie does neither end nor end up being a car / bike-filled drum that goes down like any vehicle in the movie. <br /> <br /> The first thing wrong with "Mad Max" is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge story when no vigilante seems to revenge for the last 20 minutes. If the first hour was condensed for 20-30 minutes and then the last 20 added and then another hour added after that, "Mad Max would be a cool action movie with a big vigilant protagonist. Instead, Mel Gibson should wait and act as a sissy for 2/3 of the movie and then suddenly an epiphany to seek revenge.I have not yet seen the sequel "Road Warrior" and I have to admit that I am excited about it only because I want to know what he is doing next. The first movie was mostly a waste of time, George Miller does some wonderful action things here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something terrible like a burnt hand or what do you have completely Destroyed these moments, it's a horrible clich√© of B-movie technology, there is absolutely no thematic value or subtle criticism of the community in this movie no. Only one point, but the free violence of random, strange cyclists says nothing about value. Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled by Alex of "Clockwork" only ugly and completely unimposing. The PG violence just doesn't allow the violence in this gang to settle down and get a reaction from the viewer, it just choked it about something. <br /> <br /> I give credit for the amount of stuff that movie staff jumped up and crashed into, and Miller does a good job so you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best, and after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I just walk over my fingers "Road Warrior" will meet the expectations of where this movie ends, otherwise it is more time wasted. ~ Steven C <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
