I just watched this movie on DVD late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words, the creators planned to make comedy not drama. In the end, however, I realized that Tony Giglio was serious about this movie. It's a shame because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the play is poor and lifeless, history is a fishy tale! Bad Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character in the movie is probably his worst achievement! What to say to Jason Statham - lacking all kinds of skills to develop the role of an imaginary fiction ... For these reasons I vote: 3/10
