This may be one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it - action, direction, script, filmography - is terrible. The alien (a human being in a sparkling suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant "galaxy", but did not disturb to get a dictionary to check his terms. A better title for the movie would be "It came from the plot control plot." The reason is too stupid and almost non-existent. People get all the magic MacGuffins that are in line with a heavy series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. Any thought over time is ignored. Now it's a few days after meeting the foreigner, so BAM! Suddenly, there are only a few hours left to zero hours. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You will make you stupid for seeing it. The ending is particularly silly and should have been accompanied by someone who goes "Ta-Da !!!!" as a scriptwriter, just pulling something random out of his ass. I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so badly that you get cancer that sees it. If you can see the last 10 minutes without throwing yourself ("the enemies of freedom" - honestly) laughing, you're retarded.
