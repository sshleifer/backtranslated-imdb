I saw a screening of this movie last night. I had high expectations going into it but was absolutely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So all that aspect of the movie goes. The first half hour is fun. Don't make me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour it takes a trip to the worst. It will be less of a comedy and more of a thriller / drama / love story ... which is meaningless. The film goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughs scattered here and there, but the consistently fun part is in the beginning and only the beginning. At one point, the biggest cheering I heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd shouted 'Boooo' during a very confusing emotional scene. Williams gives a good performance, just like his comic style. Walken also delivers a strong supportive role that he can only do. I think the one character that goes underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, it is fun to see him tone it down for a PG-13 rating. Overall, I wouldn't pay to watch the movie. Afterall I saw it for free and even I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid and it is completely downhill from there. Not really suitable for a category, the film realizes halfway through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special. 4.5 / 10
