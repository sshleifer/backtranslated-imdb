I guess when people say this is beautifully busy, they talk about approaching frogs and cooking meals. It certainly does not refer to the set that seems to be composed of about 3 rooms without any foreign shots at all. The whole thing is being filmed too close. <br /> <br /> I got sick of the little boy holding up the Miu or pouring hot wax over ants ... also Vietnamese are constantly using their hands? Kind of roughly looks at the way this film depicts it. A close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more. So finally come part two ... a chick flick for Vietnamese girls with the perfect beautiful rich man who spends all day on the piano (he is grown). The beautiful girl steals him as the forbidden green mango fruit. Deep. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few fine close-ups, this movie is a dud. It's a kind of soap opera with out dialogue. It's cloyed. How is it beautiful ?? The set looks completely fake. <br /> <br /> No doesn't make the mistake I made and rent it because someone recommended it. I had expected beautiful shots from Vietnam's coastal mountains or something when I heard it was a visual gem. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I like foreign films themselves prefer them. But this movie is stupid and boring. It will leave you annoyed that something like this won a bunch of prizes.
