Old Ed was active back in the late 1950s. He was arrested on November 16, 1957. PR-24 Police Baton was invented in 1974. Nevertheless, the police in the movie are all with PR 24. Back it would have been a standard "Billy club" not the side-managed PR 24. Sheeze if you will make movies do your research and get it right. It also does not mention Ed's use of the bodies. He tanned most of the skins and made various articles, including a lampshade, a belt and several masks. He also had a large selection of "shrunken heads", which several local children knew, as he was often babysitting for them. He was found incompetent and committed to Central State Hospital for the criminally insane.
