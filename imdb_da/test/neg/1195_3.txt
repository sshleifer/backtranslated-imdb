Had the league been unknown, making this script, the backers would have just turned around and said "no - you don't have the money - it's terrible". As a fan of the Gentlemen League, this is their poorest outing to date. Not very fun, not very entertaining, there are few laughs loudly. They exist, but they are few and far between. I felt the format was tired and really draws. The film refers to the authors who are bored with the characters, and it shows. As for being a movie. I felt that Xmas special had better production value; The FX is generally rather poor and it is obvious that they did not film in the original Royston Vasey (they filmed this on the cheap in Ireland). The musical score is weak and the dialogue is horrible. Also, the accents of the characters were largely from their television equivalents. Tubs and Edward, very underused (again), just don't sound like themselves. Disappointing really, because I was hoping for something far more entertaining. This was really the league's equivalent of the 1970s comedies, where the cast went to Spain ...
