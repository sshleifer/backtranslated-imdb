As a fan of the old series, I have to say that at best this is a parody of a much loved series. First, the old series would at least try to follow a military structure. I know in this P.C. The world is not something to do, but hey, don't make it to the nursing children. In the old series, Beachead was a hard-talking soldier, now he is a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is the flying tank, ok it flies out of the cobra base and jumps off the copter and they are both ok ???? Let's see if the next one is not better, this could spell the end of G.I.joe.
