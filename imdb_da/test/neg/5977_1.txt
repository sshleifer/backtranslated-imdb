The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when viewed under the influence, but it is not at all good. A 15 minute sequence of Jack Black beautifully plays one of his songs and tripping on acid as he walks through the woods, not even hiding this movie. Every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things, except for the main girls I couldn't think of a movie where I had seen them before. I hate to bash movies, but I also hate to be able to find something decent in movies. The movie is sad, not very funny and had such potential with its amazing cast. If it was redone and written over it could be fantastic. If you want a good movie to see rocky, see Grandma's Boy, or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused, but this is not a movie seen at all.
