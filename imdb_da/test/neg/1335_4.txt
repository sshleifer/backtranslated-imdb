Well, I fell for it. I saw the box for this in the video store and mistook it for "Girlfight" which I had heard was amazing. In my own defense, the titles are the same, and they made the cover for the box again, so it looked almost identical. Nevertheless, of course, they traveled the entire front page packaging / promo to exploit the buzz / success of "Girlfight". I hit it and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straight-to-video flicks, and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie that looked like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main function. When I saw the first few minutes, and Maria Conchita Alonso appeared, I knew I had fallen for it. (Don't understand me, she's a talented actress, but I knew she wasn't in "Girlfight", the movie I had been under the false impression I rented). <br /> <br /> So, apart from me feeling kind of cheated and angry at myself for not looking closer, the movie was ok. The plot involves Belle, a young latino woman who is the daughter of a former master boxer. One of her close friends is a female boxer who - and I could see all of this coming so far before it was really a move - is severely wounded during a fight with a midfielder named "The Terminator", which looks like a female version. of a larger, more pumped up Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer himself and avenge his friend. She lives with her caring, supportive, yet protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who is just a policeman. Her love interest, also caring and supportive yet protective, is also a policeman who works with her father. Hmmm, they both have jobs that put their lives at risk in the duty ... wonder what to do? She starts to train and meets a relaxed leader who, of course, pretends to care about her, but just wants to exploit her. The actor the employee looks like a very hiring Cary Eweles and is so young he almost doesn't manage to have a mustache. His performance was also really, really bad. I don't even go into the plot because anyone who has seen Rocky or almost everyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end. <br /> <br /> This was not a horrible movie. Most of the actors were ok and the leading actress was very good. There were good, strong female Latino role models. The final battle scene made me be interested, even though I knew everything that was going to happen long before it did. The actor who played "The Terminator" did a good job of being unlikely enough that I really wanted Belle to kick her a $$ and anchored in Belle again, though there were absolutely no surprises. My favorite moment (maybe the only moment when I wasn't angry with myself to rent the movie by mistake) was when Belle hit his shabby leader after showing his true colors, shouting at him and then turning away To suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear, shows that she really is the one responsible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really, really bad, my biggest complaint. One of their attempts to be witty was someone who discussed boxing that said "size doesn't matter" and the woman answers hard, "now where have I heard it before?" Other lines that should have dramatic impact are "Doctors told me I must never go again!" "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "your mother would have been so proud of you". I could go on and on again. Nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or movie-of-the-week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too much - the filmmakers made an effort and I volunteered all the way ... but only because there was nothing else to see while I was working. You can do worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters), but you can do a lot, much better.
