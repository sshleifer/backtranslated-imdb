I bought this thing that was used on a video game store's clearance bin. I wanted to get the guilty feeling of seeing something I've been warned too intense to look at; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad to see a "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox doesn't work because it's so campy and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show the "shocking" staffs, chops, slices - you just see the succession. (They show a breast hook in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. The "cannibals" are, of course, poor people from Central and South America who were dressed as jungle parlors and told to trade. Of course, these people were on the whole picture to get some money, or food or both. Again ... just not convincing. But as everyone else has said, there is some real killing of animals going on here. That is the extent of realism. For me, it was more shocking than any gutting, chopping scalps or castration, and even then the animal deaths are not so crazy at all - maybe just sad.
