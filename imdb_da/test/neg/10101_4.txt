The first half of this movie had some promise, as it seemed that the film was a low-lying character psychodrama like MINUS MAN, but then the whole collapse collapsed in clich√© and the viewer slowly lost all interest. There is a decent cast here, but the movie is lifeless and the talent is completely wasted.
