Yes. A real stinker. I watched this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me this is a great "psychological" movie. This movie does everything to be not understandable. I was aware that I was in a stink after seeing the first 20 minutes. I waited since I expected to see something valuable, and most importantly, I paid for this movie. The wait was unbearable. After watching the movie, I talked to my friends and learned that in the intellectual environment (they call themselves under this title) in Turkey, this "movie" had been recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the stinkers category. I think a movie should be self-explanatory. This film is just the opposite. Stay away from this thing that calls itself a "movie". Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Price: 1 out of 10
