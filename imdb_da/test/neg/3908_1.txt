About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental store to get something to look at. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, and then we got it. When we got home and started to see it, we realized what an absolute piece of shit was! A beer can float in the room? A guy taking a dump on a toilet? A guy with a mechanical cock trying to wake a woman by saying "Whiz, whiz!"? WTF !!! The stupidest, stupidest, most retarded, horrible throne, together with a piece of waste, has ever been my eyes. My friend and I still refer to it as the worst movie we have ever seen. Only another movie has come close to its crappiness (and that would be the stupid Jackie Chan flick, "The Medalion"). If you ever see this piece of junk on the shelf of your video store, do the following: 1. Remove it from the shelves and snap it to the ground. 2. Stomp it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue to put it on fire in a contained facility (bathroom). 4. Finally, take it to your local waste treatment plant immediately so that it can be treated properly. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM "SPACE TRUCKERS" !!!!!!!!
