I found this movie in the flea market too cheap. I was so psyched because I thought it was a skateboard movie. I came home and put it on, the preview rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the skateboard were fantastic. At that moment I realized it was a post-apocalyptic movie, but I still had great hopes for it. This movie was horrible. One of my friends was stoned out of his mind when we looked at it, and even he thought it was terrible and a waste of being tall. I kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was absolutely horrible. I do not know if during the apocalypse all the good music and all the music that is only a kind of brittleness is destroyed, and everyone's memory of how to play it, is clean, but I think I would rather die than having to endure that shit. Also what the hell was there with the TV studio? I can only assume that this movie was adapted from an old Greek game with name and title, but some players are not meant to be adapted to a futuristic sci-fi setting. Or at least not of the people involved in this movie. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only suggest bringing a handgun and ending yourself before the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself, everyone will understand why.
