Rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still is (more or less) acceptable? Bloodline is a pretty short (which is a good thing in this case) escapade that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted it to be made and how it spelled a spell on the whole bloodline of the man who eventually created it. We are introduced to 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in the 18th century Paris, one in the present and the last in a future galaxy far far away ?? The opinions on this story may differ greatly, otherwise you think it is very idiotic and removed or original and dared. The original atmosphere and setting of Clive Barker has completely disappeared, but the morbid surrounding remnants and multiple sequences are still very creepy and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains a lot of exquisite slaughter, and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is still an extra horror value. Pinhead ?? accompanied by a pet puppy this time ?? Still knowing how to kill otherwise wrong, he speaks too much, and his evil speech tends to get boring fast. The best aspects of this production are the newly introduced `cenobites' and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Although not very memorable, Bloodline is the last watchable Hellraiser movie. After this successor, the series went completely downhill. So far, there have been 2 more successors (2 others are still in progress) and none of them are worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered from a lot of production problems, and the director ultimately preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee ??, which means he won't be remembered as director of it. Who could blame him?
