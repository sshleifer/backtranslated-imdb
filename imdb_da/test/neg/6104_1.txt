The movie opens with a scene that simply couldn't be. A man wakes up and while his wife goes to bed, he begins his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. The morning blessings are recited, but only the Gitai finds controversial. The rest is conveniently omitted. so while he is in the cellar and a tallis kissing his wife good morning !! This is not a precise portrayal of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone a chassis house. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying the chassidic life. He is interested in adding to his ever-growing list of melodramatic and empty films. Mickey (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his Jewish wedding was ridiculous as it did not even approach the atmosphere of a chassidic wedding. I have many problems with the chassidic lifestyle, but I do not need Amos Gittai's comment on these issues. He wanted you to think that chassidim are all close comformists with severe depression. I cannot agree with the chassidic lifestyle, but I recognize that the chassidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubbornness and is therefore unable to depict a precise deposit of the chassidic life. Apart from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of the chassidic life, Gitai also fails in other aspects. The plot is filled with holes, the dialogue is loaded with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive, and the play, while at times it was too often filled with the melodrama. The movie pulls again and again and the end is not worth sticking around for. See if you should, but be warned. If you want to learn about the chassidic life, go to the communities and talk to chassidim. Don't trust Gittai's movie!
