Why repeat the original "attack"? In my opinion, "Assault" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It had all the elements that good Carpenter movies contain. External threat to a small group of individuals. People take the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember that the guns in Carpenter's original didn't make any sound, which is so much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this is remake. Concentrates on "the protagonist's psychology" and on his relationship with protagonist II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie is being replaced by a fairly conventional conspiracy / corruption background. "Remakers" just understood the main type of the original. And thus produced something quite common.
