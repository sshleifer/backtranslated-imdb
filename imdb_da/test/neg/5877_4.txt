You can see that if the girl is not directed by her brother, it is the best thing he can do. And sad to say, his best just doesn't cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very bizarre horror movie, it's a real blast to see if you're in the right mood. In the wrong mood, it has been known to make people shed a lot in their loved ones, so please look with caution. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard stars (Does anything really star Clint Howard himself?) As "malicious" "psychotic" "bizarre" (yes, all in quotes, he's not quite any of these, but he comes close to) the ice-maker who tortures the local children with bombers who are really melting and ice-cream that has cut people and dogs in them. Ick. Yet the plot is really just an excuse to show off ... well, the ... um, yes it's a plot. Oh wait, I know! It's an excuse to show everyone loses the actors cameos! There is Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) As the police that trace the elusive man o 'ice. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket consultant. <br /> <br /> Even better than some of the bizarre goofs in the movie. I really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a bold actor to play the unhappy "fat" kid in the group, they just make one child wear upholstery under his clothes. And the whole premise that someone would push ice from an ice cream man. Who buys ice cream from the ice cream maker? Then there is the whole psychiatric ward scene, where Jan Michael Vincent's play ranges from mildly interested to bored over the state of consciousness. It is the policemen who also clear the ice man's place for track, but manage to fill the gloss over the ice car (where the various bodies and the like are kept of course). Well, good luck next time troops. <br /> <br /> Howard himself overcomes as he makes sure people over two cities can see and hear him. It's just stupid. And fun to laugh in the fine tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You want a good laugh with the right sense of mood. I love the one. <br /> <br />
