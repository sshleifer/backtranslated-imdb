If you value your life in any way, shape or form, you will make yourself a courtesy and pass this seemingly "interesting" movie on DVD rack. I know what you're thinking, "I saw the previve, and it looked good!" But the buyer watches, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced her to put it out. Oh how I regret this decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the movie starts cheerfully in a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are lured to an old Mayan ruin by a fellow resort-goer. On arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but ignorant of their greeting. As if this is not vicious, the travel group throws away from large plant growth and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife a perfect route to their destination. I think it would not be much of a movie if they took rational decision making and turned around right now, but it wasn't so much in a movie. After some hiking sixsome (the resort goer brought a friend) stumbled across the ruins and at one time their doubts were removed by its beauty and history. That is, until frantic tribal people come out of the jungle armed with a vengeance for no particular reason and shout in an inexplicable language. Since when are brutal verbal assaults stunned by calm, condescending language - don't ask me - but nevertheless, the thrust nevertheless tries, to no avail, of course. Suddenly, the sixth track member, Dimitri, is dotted with several Mayan arrowheads, and the whole hell goes loose. A shot hits the job, and the horrified travelers quickly retreat to the ruin. <br /> <br /> Now, if there was ever a plot for this movie, it ended here. The introduction took a maximum of 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie. On top of the ruins, it now discovers square that they are stranded by murderous locals and continues to make countless good decisions, one of which is to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the ruin of the ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and then caught in the ruins, and the two girlfriends are seriously injured and are trying to save him. The rest of the film continues plotlessly without any real horror, only only blood and do as shown when a girl's yanks plant grows in her out, gushing blood flows and then again when someone's leg is cut off just to have the same spot from the inside. The girl stifles him later. <br /> <My only satisfaction in this movie was observing the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, growing more and more frazzled and distressed and sitting long enough to ensure that almost all castes die a horrible, cruel death. Their simulated pain seems to be an appropriate compensation for the time that sucks that movie. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the story tells that the ruin is an ancient house of dangerous spirits with a vicious, flattering plant to ward off and consume unfortunate visitors. Unfortunately, I didn't get such a warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants, and the only evil thing about this movie that I really am horrified of is the scriptwriter.
