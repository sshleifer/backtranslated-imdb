Predictable, unmotivated meaningless caricatures. Sharp actors did what they could. Actors clearly indicated that they were embarrassed to do so. Not an emotional connection. REAL SEQUENCE FROM FILM "Who do you call?" (sic) "Police" (sic) "You can't do that, Stevie. Hang up the phone" (sic) "Jesse got a sh-t load o 'drug you can't go with the police" (sic) "I am Not so sure to steal money from criminals is a crime. Although they arrest him at least, he will be alive "(sic)" Listen to me, Stevie, this is not being dealt with properly, Jesse must end up being dead. Now the f-in phone was hanging. "(Sic) Best friend starts putting up guns Brother," Hey, what are you doing? " No answer. "Hi, I got a family to worry about." (Keep in mind that his child is right here and see it all here). So more and more exhibitions <br /> <br /> Notice how in the above order, in no time says the police on the second line "Hi? Hey? Uh, we can hear everything you say. We'll send someone over there now." <br /> <br /> All embarrassment. Oops.
