Yes, the lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid. And this soap opera doesn't laugh when they make Perry King, apparently a well-known physician, unable to look around him. Does your trust in doctors, huh? How can anyone not see what's going on? Is he so stupid? And the wicked wife, with a face like a horse, walks around and kills his entire family without a trace. How does she acquire all drugs? It is not explained. How does she go out as a secretary in a hospital without any credentials? I guess the director, Don FauntLeRoy is asking us to just believe it. I did not do it. I kept shouting at the screen of King's stupidity with just in front of his face. If wife was so attractive, maybe, maybe just, I would accept it. But she's not even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell you she has a face on a horse. I didn't want to cross the street for her, but our perfect man does and quickly. After everyone in the cast was knocked off, I was not happy with the upcoming pledge given to our villain. She deserved more than she got. William Moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately knows his outcomes from day one. Pleasure to at least see a beautiful face in this clinker. That by Lesley Anne Down. She gives the movie a 2 count only on the relief of seeing someone download in this mess. Perry King deserved his fate. What an idiot.
