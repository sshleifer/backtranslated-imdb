If this is the best in the Finnish cinema at the moment, I would say that the big treasures used in support of "culture" have been playing here in a terrible way. Paha Maa is the worst example of trying to make a Finnish "European film" to large audiences. I'm sure they wanted it to be all state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time. The result is crap. <br /> <br /> To make it brief: - The story is pretentious, naive and not credible. The same goes for the characters. I can imagine that they are brainstorming to make a movie where "everything would be to turn to *** and people would be hurt and feel, you know really bad inside because Finnish people are so infamous depressed too and their self-It is so bad ", which brings us to ... <br /> <br /> - The movie is full of clichés, mostly about" the Finnish mentality ". The way it treats people's problems and their causes can be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull psychology self-help book. ("We feel so bad inside!") I am sure they also saw some Kaurismäki finding out what it is about his movie that people like, misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring, depressing history of people who go through all sorts of things for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. It's a screaming shame they threw in Tolstoy here. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And not to be. <br /> <br /> - I think the worst mistake, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is very unoriginal. It is also frustrating to see infinite sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it. I can go through this kind of mind ** ck if the movie is fun or ends up being a thorough joke, or better yet, something sublime as in eg. von trier breaks the waves There were none in Paha Maa. In fact, I started to laugh at some point because the events were again too predictable, over-top and incredible. Who does this? And who likes it? I hope they pretend.
