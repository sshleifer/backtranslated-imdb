I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" that ended in film history, but of course I was wrong. I had no disillusionment that this movie should be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than expected. The worst part is that the obvious end is so ridiculous and awful that you can't believe it until it actually happens.
