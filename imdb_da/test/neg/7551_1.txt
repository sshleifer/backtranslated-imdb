Possibly the worst movie within the genre in existence. It was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragic pathetic. I don't think anyone could have achieved something more terrible and annoying if they were specifically requested. It is toilet room at the very poorest, I wanted to avoid seeing the trailer myself. I only went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you are bound to love this. The one who wrote it was either strained or severely horrified. I'm still confused about how to honestly believe in such a statement. I rarely leave the cinema, it really requires a movie to have that effect on me: it did so in just 30 minutes.
