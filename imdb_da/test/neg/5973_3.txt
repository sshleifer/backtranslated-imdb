The title of this documentary is very misleading. In no time under the documentary film they show how the introduction of the Nile aboriginal fish into Lake Victoria has caused the problems with the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film tries to place the problems in Tanzania for an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems stem from a parasitic external force. The documentary goes very slowly without any narrative, what ever. Instead, it relies on small flashes of text between no related segments to display bitwise information that does nothing to add or expand the topic. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental impact of the Nile aboriginal fish. One is a small segment about 10 seconds in which they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he mentions 50 years ago that the Nile perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. The film producer makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. The second attempt is when, within this documentary, they appear to show another documentary discussing the environmental impact introduced by the Nile perch, and again, no real attempt has been made to expand how equally devastating the problem has been . <br /> <br /> The subject of this documentary has nothing to do with the aboriginal issue itself and more about the problems that most African countries face. The film tries to connect the introduction of the aboriginal fish with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person reads well with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania, but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish. It would have been good if the filmmakers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it was adversely affected by the introduction of the fish, but they do not. The fact is that many of the people they interviewed say that the fish have given jobs and opportunities for many. Yes things are bad within the city of Mwanza, but they are by far the worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentaries to connect fish with famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First, Tanzania is a very large country, and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Indeed, many of the individuals' interviews say they can go to Mwanza, the fishing village on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to link anything that they point to the Nile perch. It plays on people's feelings by displaying images of the destruction of poverty, famine and AIDS, which do nothing to show you how some of this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to the Aboriginal fish. The fact is that most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and Christianity than the environmental effects of the aboriginal fish themselves.
