The reason for this movie is very thin and there is not much to do. Val Kilmer - I don't know why he agreed to make this movie - playing a minor role as a gang leader. In short, the movie is boring to see. A guy who looks like an archeology / religious professor examines a subterranean area in Moscow that has some history of railway construction and Bolshevik revolution. A church tragedy in that story makes the exploration "spiritual" and spirits of a malicious intent to haunt the underground ruins. A friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of Russian guides. The entire film is based on this plot and contains much repeated underground footage and some camera effects; much like those seen in "Day Watch", "Night Watch" etc.
