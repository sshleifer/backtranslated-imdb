This is really abysmal. I just got a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after hearing good things about it, and I have to say that this was just as incredibly unfunny and bad, it will leave you numb and mystified how it ever became done. /> <br /> I mean, what was that? Is this the typical late 70's humor? I do not think. This is just so bad, and believe me, I also don't mean "so bad, it's good" either. This is a collection of extremely scary sketches as if you were watching cable TV. Sure enough, this was an HBO program, and believing that this could have been considered groundbreaking is scary. There is a pretty girl in it and there are some old NHL recordings of NY Islander's hockey team, which is fun to see though I'm a lifelong NY Rangers fan. But they spoil it themselves when they try to get some humor out of two hockey players scuffling on the ice, as if they "dances" and even worse, turn the videotape off of two hockey players struggling to make it look as if they have sex oh how fun! In a little bit of wisdom there is an interview a hockey player named "Chico" who looks like NY Islander goalkeeper Chico Resch, but they even blow this by having him wearing a Rangers jersey! Well, maybe it was intentional who knows. The bottom line is, "Disco Beaver" is just so obviously awful, so incredibly bad, you will definitely feel cheated when you see this and waste almost an hour of your life. You'll wonder what might have created the creators of this garbage that they had some fun here, and you'll also wonder why these sketches can't even get close to the worst Saturday Night Night slop. Incredible. Just incredible.
