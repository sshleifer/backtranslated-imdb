I disagree with many people here. but I really didn't find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read claimed. It was undoubtedly a moving story, and the partition background gave the opportunity for an epic. but the movie was a disappointment. especially for neon who have seen 'gadar'. Although the lead is played by sunshine animals and the incessant songs, I have to say that gadgets are the better of the two. The story is pretty much the same. The partition could not create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that should have an influence. about looking at the croc's crown's accent and the little picture that in itself was not an easy job. The characters just didn't seem too real. not that I criticize the action by any of the guidelines. It just didn't work. The atmosphere was well prepared, but the film really lacked substance. not that I am dead hard rambo fan, but some action cud have seen the movie through or some sign development. It all seemed like a hurry to the goal. and the end is only added to the viewers' dissatisfaction. Nonetheless, I must say that at least it was a good effort in seemingly unknown territory by the director. And if you haven't seen the streets, then you are beating it yourself.
