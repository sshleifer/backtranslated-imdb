When I first heard about this movie, I was eager to rent it and thought (mistakenly) that it was one of those bad-fun movies and that I was a treat. I was mistaken. <br /> <br /> Initially, the pace is agonizingly, mind-numbingly slow. The pace doesn't even begin to pick up until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The reason was dull and the end was unnoticed and confusing. For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap tensions, look elsewhere. This film gives cheesiness in spades, but lacks much in "excitement," cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Try "Child's Play" instead.
