George Cukor's women remain one of the glittering gems of 1939, Hollywood's most golden of golden years. The movie broke and kicked and it was the absence of men was a subtle touch, hardly noticed because of the fine entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City, in front of Scissors. Big crowds busy along Avenue ... but something is off. The shot reveals only well-dressed (attractive and young) women. Creator than I am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later on a great fashion show. Which NYC fashion show does not have at least 5 gay men? The rule of "no men" is struck down in our throats and creates a strange world, without balance and distracting. Enter Meg Ryan, who has first been dug in her garden with a ridiculous get-up complete with his retro curls and flailing arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. Later in the film she morphs into an older Jennifer Aniston look and holds her arms on her sides. This seems intentional as saying "Look! I can still be relevant!" Ryan's character is downloaded with a federation of miss-matched friends (insert the Sex and City comparison here), as if it were real life, would banish each other. Annette Bening plays the power of the bitch, who during the film realizes that her life's dream doesn't really make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power of lesbian, all-minded without the need for any of the men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice for the bad girl to say the least. She looks fake, seems fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat. Someone here commented that she saw trans-sex was spot on. Other different stars show up, rearranging the furniture on this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have named their price, stuck their tongues firmly in their cheeks and pulled out something very wise and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks too much about that kind of exploitation. Instead, we get this thing that lumbers together suddenly without sparkle. Whole parts of the dialogue from the original are lifted and dropped into a scene with terrible results. At one point Ryan exclaims something like this: "This is not a 1930s movie!" No, it's not.
