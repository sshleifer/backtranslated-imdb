The one who followed this stupid idea of ​​acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a hood that covers almost half of its face all the time? Only hope it is first and last also for God's sake! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but awful statements of words such as Tanhaiyya, which completely kills the beauty of the expressions so commonly used for love songs. Why doesn't Himesh smile? Simple because he does not use close up toothpaste! Now this friend of him who speaks him anywhere, and this number one lawyer in the city, who has to cheat himself and try to seduce Himesh, by all the beautiful German people she might have met earlier, maybe The male attorneys of this part of the world can curse their destiny to be destined to handle the rigid, uninteresting party every day! The action scenes are so much fun shot as the event planner attacked by the thief, cars driving over the cars, etc. The bride's father seems to be very busy getting rid of his daughter by marrying her that he flies back and forth. Most hypocrite, he praises HR for distributing love among the world's people as if they were licking, and on the back, he gave a cool lecture to his daughter at these show businessmen. When Himesh has become innocent, he again dumps the invisible dump the other guy, as if it is a game of musical chair! I couldn't see the poor guy's face myself, did you? Hansika in the role of Ria, looks like she needs eye control, for eye strain! The Fellow of a Friend's Role is Good, who has acted naturally and should be in better movies, such as Sharman Joshi. Child artist in Trishu's short appearance is sweet, but wasted. It seems that today's young generation has been in distress as they prefer this kind of lure to lyrics and musical scores, and associating gossip with it, for example, if I just sing, the ghost would come. This is a strange taste in music and quite fun. I am surprised how such classic poets as Gulzar have chosen Himesh for all the peoples to give music. There is history in the Panchtantra that a collar attaches so many feathers to a peacock, to look beautiful and appeal to the birds; but the feathers eventually fall and the real dark collar is revealed! Hope Himesh takes a hint and refrains from making such pointless things and wasting precious money that he has earned by taxing his short nose so much! His friend tells him if your nose is cut, how would you sing? Thanks for showing us Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable price by renting the DVD! and correct the spelling mistakes, will you? an extra e in movie, and no e in love! There is also a famous number from the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, where Mallika Sherawat wiggles again, but this time with Himesh, flashes on her and comfortable, Ria, his so-called true love and his new bride are not present! Now it was very wise, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie that you've made smart to justify Sherawat's presence. But doesn't she look a little washed down?
