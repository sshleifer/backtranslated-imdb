I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved some of the dialogue in the Tribunal - which turned out to be the best showcase for the director's up-to-date methodology - but this movie eventually disappoints. Even when seen solely as a metaphor of the oppressive / repressed dynamics that was and prevails in the relationship between the US government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks blows and credibility, and ultimately I left My watch and hoped for a clear end would already happen. <br /> <br /> And for the record: despite fierce rumors to the contrary, this movie has never been banned in the United States (I can't comment on the rumors of British censorship, but I am suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its first film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government had some influence on this decision; But the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather cautious and advertising-driven way of doing business. As for the present, you can get your very own copy of the DVD delivered to your door via Amazon within a few days.
