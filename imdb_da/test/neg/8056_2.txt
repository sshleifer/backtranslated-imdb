I'm probably one of the few people to defend and even enjoy "Fresh", the project that puts Todd Verow on the card if it is actually where he is. I appreciated that someone had the courage to go on Dennis Cooper and not back from the material; Verow rolls right in it. Judging by what he has done since then, he is suitable for that kind of material and must probably stick to it. "Vacationland", a "teenage coming out" movie, is so misled in so many ways that it becomes unintentional comedy, and I'm disappointed to report it. <br /> <br /> First, our hero, high school senior "Joe" is too old in appearance to play 18. When we later meet a man who was to be Joe's teacher, it is confusing as it Sweaty face guy looks much younger than the student he teaches. Joe's mother looks younger than he does, and neither does it seem older. Second, he saw Joe's opening scenes as he either played or actually experienced mental challenges. To his credit he got better when the movie continued, and I figured he was "young" but it just didn't work - it was weird. It is 15 minutes before something is revealed about who, what and where these people are and why we should care about. The second scene in the film is an extended business in a men's toilet room, which, given where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; The subplot with the teacher does not go at all at all, even as a "passage for passage" to our "young" hero ... for a moment Joe tries nervously to the hand of the bathroom sex (a scene so erotic it really makes you wonder what someone looks in practice), next time he is an expert in sexual extortion and violent double crossing. This is followed by an expanded scene with the character that we will learn later, "Andrew", and it's all about what we learn about him, except that he seems to be gay, but not out yet. There is very crammed in to 1:44 maturity (which is about 20 minutes too long - I can't imagine how it played with Joe's emotionally long and pointless deleted scenes); an underplot cut from "god and monsters" with an old cartridge spitting rhetoric, allows nothing to be played by an actor who obviously cannot remember his lines (he is conveniently shipped in a way like Dickens might have been on a slow week); a mix-n-match almost four-way between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay-bashing toilet tramp, a wild sailor in the form of a nellie queen (and has not the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of "hooker with the heart of gold" as the most tired stereotype?) only impaired; extortion, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording. <br /> <br /> What you DO NOT find in this movie is any device that creates masterpieces; we are expected to imagine that we are at an airport, merchant office and classroom, as all scenes at these sites are close-ups and poorly-edited soundscapes to convey the idea of ​​sites that production must not have been able to afford. One thing they could bring forth seems to have been a real gay bar; Whether it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor, Maine, since the bar never has any patrons in it. Another good chuckle came when the actors were shouting for dance music that apparently did not come from the speakers, but were just more of the droning loop music in the "scored". <br /> <br /> Drawings and characters come and go, feelings are unreadable, and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "movie talk," meaning no one actually speaks this way. Since we do not get any information about these signs, it is impossible to care about what is happening to them; It looks as if Joe et al. look out of the air one day and can simply cease to exist when the credits roll (definitely the character of Joe's sister, a wannabee Jennifer Gray, who is Bohemian crazy, just seems to "stop" we never know where she is in LA or what her problem is ... but again ... does it matter?). Visually, the film seems to be very good at times, more a testament to new developments in hi-def video than anything, I suppose. Editing is quite lumpy though (there was a big edit; Joe makes up naked and says, "I would like to play sports, but ..." and we cut to a shot that revealed his "butt ..." ha ha). The composition is also weird at times (I thought I saw SCTV's parody of "Persona" when the boys talked to bed and visually, it looked like their noses were sitting together for the whole scene!). <br /> <br /> A sense Verow really stays in a position to make a "naughtier" or a coarser movie as he usually does, and perhaps he shouldn't have stopped (the foamed toothpaste / sex fantasy worked fine, I thought, even though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the film) ... he produces and manages this "sensitive coming of age" story like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed movies without gore ... porn movies without sex in them. I got some unintentional laughs out of this and it wasn't boring, nor was it very good.
