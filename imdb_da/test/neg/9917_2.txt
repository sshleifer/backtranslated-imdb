I sat at home and turned channels as I skipped what might sound like an interesting movie. I like the Destruction type movie and decided to watch it. I don't know why, but I ended up seeing it all 2 hours. We've seen this type of movie, I don't know how many times. Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozens of films dealing with global destruction of some kind. The best on my list so far is Deep Impact, which was more credible than this one. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) Cheap special effects like something out of the old computer. 2) No background information or explanation of weather patterns. If you want to make a movie about the weather, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on Chicago ... no more experts back in the field? 4) Where are some interesting signs? I really don't care about anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt there was no character development. 5) No thought-provoking moment what so ever and actually erroneous theme. And that's just the first part of the movie. I bet the conclusion will show us few scenes of destruction and a search and rescue operation like it has been done many times before. And judging by the special effects in the film's first part, I can only imagine what we can expect. Of course, the main characters at the end will survive, and life will continue ... how original
