This movie does not know what it will be: is it fun with action movies in general? Is it satirical? Should it be a black comedy? This really is one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There I said what everyone else thinks. It is bad enough that she is such a horrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she does not even qualify as a mediocre b-movie actress. Her screechy voice, strange manicures and bad comic timing dot this movie from start to finish until you just put your head in a wing and finish the pain. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. You will be glad you did.
