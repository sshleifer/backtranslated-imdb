Definitely the worst experience I've ever been through. I think my eyes began to bleed. I actually got sick the night after seeing this. I'm not even considering a movie. Movies should be worthwhile and entertaining. This fails terribly. I couldn't do it throughout the movie, so because the end could be the biggest phenomenon in movie history, it gets a 1 for that little chance. Otherwise, it would be a flat 0. <br /> <br /> I can't see how National Lampoon, or even any organization, would sponsor this cruelty. Rental of this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes in my life. Just watch this, if you want to ever make another movie you will ever see, well. <br /> <br /> Without question, it's the worst movie I've ever seen.
