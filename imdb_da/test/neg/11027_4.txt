Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarre constructed movie about the hardship of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were packed together among different directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra sweet, some flounder, some melodramatic and some surprising noir. There is even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are most inconsistent when the movie as a whole is so irregular in tone, and the story isn't exactly credible. Only worth watching at movie students or fans of the actors - some smaller parts, like Judge Doolittle and the pristine pilot, are also playing very well.
