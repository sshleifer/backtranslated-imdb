Hi guys, this is my first review and I would have chosen the worst movie for review. Since I only looked 5 minutes of it, but trust me, you could see that this movie was not going. The action was regrettable, the camera's work and lighting looked like it was shot and driven by a pack of 10 year olds. No offense to 10 year olds. I just couldn't take anymore. I got out of my sofa, took The House of Adam DVD out of the DVD player and threw it in the trash. Maybe if you are a Colin Farrell fan, this movie may interest you because the character of the movie Anthony is a Colin Farrell that looks like one. But it is as far as it goes, he will certainly never have carbon-drawing abilities. I gave this movie a rating of 1 (horrible) only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers.
