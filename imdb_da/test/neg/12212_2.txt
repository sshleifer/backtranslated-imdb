James Marsh's King is a movie that mystifies me. I can't think of what it was supposed to be for. It's a story of a young man called Elvis, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who gets a glorious print after 3 years of naval service and then goes out to find his biological father and behaves dishonestly with him and his family. It's all pretty bad really. Elvis snakes his way into the family by seducing his 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). It is quite impossible to identify with anyone in this movie from here in England. Preacher father and jumping joyful Christian congregation; I couldn't figure out if the movie is meant to limit them to their thoughtless beliefs. Or is the goal the happy family, and we are supposed to believe that it is inevitable. OR just say some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction. It's low. We all know that bad things are happening; The interesting bit is to learn why, but this film shows just violence without ever tearing the mindset that has led to it. The "King" is such a lost opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; the warrior code the changing concepts of valor; honor killings in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this film doesn't add anything to the thought. But the Paul Projectionist suggested more than his modest role. The DVD projector showed all the movies in green hue, and the only way to fix this was to have it sent to Belgium. He did it through Christmas. I think these postal workers and repairers and Paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this grim movie. But you can see it differently?
