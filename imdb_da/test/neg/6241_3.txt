I would like this movie and there is certainly room for a psychologically driven movie that doesn't go for the cheap tensions. But to enjoy a movie you need a credible plot, some pacing and editing and a sense of involvement. In Clearing, it begins as an intriguing mystery, with a kidnapping and unknown motifs, for a slow, drakless meaningless exercise. Not so much happens and the so-called character-driven angles (as expressed by the director in his comment) really do not yield to much. Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best to engage and overcome Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings a little nuance to his character, as far as one can feel a little sympathetic to him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe has been typecast as a villain he has entered into Christopher Walkens Hall of Fame of Typecasting. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her character entry into the movie was short and constructed, and I wondered why they even bothered to introduce her character. By far the biggest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's comment, all I heard was how amazing a talent she is. I agree she is a great actress. So why wasn't she used properly? Only against the climax of this film, she has shown herself, but in that case the viewer has stopped breaking. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I liked parts of this movie, but as another reviewer wrote, again halfway in you know that the movie won't get much better.
