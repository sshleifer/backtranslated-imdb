A young woman named "T.N.T." In order to be a virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout with regard to starting, go to the most lawless part of Hong Kong in search of his missing brother Stag Jackson. When she learns that he has been murdered, she decides to bring the killer to court in a way that she can only do. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, don't do it. Well, there really is nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting point for a martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller, which is what this purpose is to be. The wires also show up quite well with Jeanne Bell, who fits nicely into the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw does well as the ambitious, power-hungry Charlie. Where this fails is in the form of the fighting that it gives up. The battle scenes are completely and completely convincing and / or sometimes so completely over the top, it reaches out to ridicule, which does not at all help when the film's basic focus is a Kung Fu action hero. Also, the poor lighting, the actors' sporting accents make them difficult to understand, the confusing camera work and the sometimes bad sound doesn't help this obvious low budget effort either. This delivers in an area that can delight some fans, it gives lots of T in "T & A", in fact, almost all the fighting situations in the movie are continued by some kind of naked scene, and Jeanne Bell actually has an expanded combat situation where she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it fails to be something you want to see again, because the battle scenes are so pathetic, ridiculously bad.
