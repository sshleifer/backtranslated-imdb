I'm not going to lie and say I don't see the show - I do. BUT it has a lot and many errors. 1) Boarding School is perfect. The drama is at a minimum. Everyone is so nice to each other, you know. Let's give it a reality check. It is impossible that any school is perfect as a PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large dorm rooms. Mini fridges. If there was a school like that in real life, almost no one would be a virgin for one. Two, all that is so rich, and it's strange that no one has anything stolen yet. 2) Sign really unrealistic. First thing first, who in the right mind speaks as they do. They talk like a perfect teenager would. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich boy "hot" teenage boy. My question is why is not almost the girl in that school over him? He is rich and "hot" one day all the girls would be after him, even though he was a jerk. Chase is also the most stupid person ever. He is this shy teenager who claims to be in love with Zoey, and overreacts everything involving Zoey. She must be BLIND not to see him in love with her. <br /> <br /> Come on, Nick. I know you can do better than that. Please..
