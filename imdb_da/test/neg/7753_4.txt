I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I got it in spades. She was lovely in the romantic scenes; too bad Bill Paxton flies on autopilot for the whole bet. I almost lost my lunch when he popped his big fat white back out of his kite, so let's say "engage" with Julia. <br /> <br /> I realized Julia was very good at French while she saw her in 'Sabrina'. I watched 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia baptized her own dialogue. They used another. In any case, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film over a native French speaker with enough English to communicate with the American flier. Perhaps they wanted at least one known name for the UK / US market. To my unknown eye, Julia's functions could pass to Belgian. <br /> <br /> The whole movie had a weird nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War II. I could imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive in the occupation than the French or Norwegian. The most fierce battles all came in the Balkans, where Tito's Communist partisans made adjustments to the Germans. <br /> <br /> I noted in another review that 'dbdumonteil' thought Julia Ormond was American instead of the actual British nationality. Perhaps Julian's play was complete enough to stave off that impression. <br /> <br /> Having watched this movie several times, it suddenly started on me how the low season is, the movie is. It is set on Junuary 16, 1944, when the American plane crashes into Belgian farm. The trees seem to be in the middle of the fall, with many leaves and the weather is warm. People turn in light clothes and the grass is still green. There is not the slightest trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium ever. <br /> <br /> The very plot of the movie was a mess. Where to start? For everyone interested in the history of World War II, the film came over as farce. The reconnaissance plan used was a large 4-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft existed, but they would have required massive fighter escort to have any chance of survival. In fact, smaller and faster aircraft were available and would have been far more suitable for the job. The vital codebooks in the movie would never have been carried on the plane. The crew did not need this information to complete their mission, while compromise with this information would have been a huge loss of intelligence. Even assuming the film, the first things to be removed from the plane will be the codebooks. They would have been on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of German troops at the crash site. The Daussois home, where 'Major Brice' took refuge, was a farm where no one had the least interest in agriculture. Food at this time would have been very scarce in Belgium. The Germans would have required significant amounts of locally produced food to support their forces. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American flier. There would have been no fuel available to run it anyway. The plot twist in which Henri Daussois looks into the American out of jealousy is pathetic. He would have had to reveal everything he knew about the resistance to be allowed to live. He would have had to act as a double agent to frustrate any effective resistance. The woman with the secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> 'Major Brice' was caught in civilian clothes towards the end of the movie. It made him a spy under the law of war and responsible for execution without defense. He would not have surrendered to meeting negotiations without hindrance to the Geneva Convention. Better to force them to kill him and save his friends if possible. I have not read the novel on which this film is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows an unfortunate lack of development in the novel. Whatever the novel, screenwriters could easily have made a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better movie.
