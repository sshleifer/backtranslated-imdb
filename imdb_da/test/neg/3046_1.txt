This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad, it made me shoot myself in the forehead. I hated this movie. First, the plot went nowhere, and something shocking about this movie was seen in a 30-second teaser trailer. Secondly, everyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was also a bad movie and totally unworthy of a remake. By far the best part of the movie is the house that takes place in. It doesn't say much for the actual movie. There were parts in the movie when the music is very exciting, and you are positive that someone is around the corner and it turns out to be the girl or the cat, but when someone is actually around the corner, it is impossible to be straight so scared because you were expecting the whole movie. So save yourself the money, save yourself time, save yourself headaches and just watch the trailer. There is absolutely no point in watching this movie, not in the theater, not on DVD, not on television, never.
