The filmmakers went well out of their way to find ONLY the following demographics: Palestinians who look like peace-loving, solution-enhancing good will, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children) who are especially disadvantageous of security fences and Israelis who do not believe in security fences, strongly sympathize with the alleged effect on the Palestinians and consider it unnecessarily divisive and / or waste of money. Oh yes, they put in a member of the Israeli government that supports the fence, but they do what they can to portray him as inhuman and creepy and ask him very leading questions that are real statements (eg "The wall is bad for the environment ... it destroys everything "). <br /> <br /> I have no problem with any (good, most) of this being presented in the movie. However, I strongly disagree with the people they interview, their statements are valid enough for a documentary. But there are at least two sides to the issue of Israel's security fence, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that it has a general positive influence, this "documentary" gives not express a uniform person. They even go as far as interviewing an Israeli Jew claiming that "all Israelis support the fence" and are so insane and then refuse to interview even such a "crazy" Israeli. Oh, and even the tone of the movie by interviewing a couple of young Israeli children (really exceptions to the rule - I've been there) laughing at / around their Arab neighbors from all over the fences. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that explores a problem and presents a wide range of facts, opinions, and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. This is an unobstructed PROPAGANDA FILM, which very clearly offers a battery of support to only one side of a highly controversial, emotionally and politically charged problem. It's no more a documentary than Fahrenheit 9/11.
