What a crazy movie! The protagonist of this movie was born and raised in Canada, but he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also do all the chicks in Canada dress that are closed? It is at least the way it is in this movie. All females are dressed as strippers. Don't waste your time with this! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wondering why Bollywood is going through a decline? It's because of movies like this. I miss the good old days when the Hindu movies were actually entertaining! I couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood should stop trying to replicate Hollywood's style because it just doesn't work. They need to adhere to their roots because that is what makes Indian movies entertaining.
