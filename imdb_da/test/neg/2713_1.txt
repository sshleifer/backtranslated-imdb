This should be one of those if not the worst movies I've ever seen. After seeing this piece, I felt as though I was writing to Madonna and claiming compensation for my time, but now I feel I should write Madonna and demand a large 80's album (considering she can't record a good album to save her life longer) in return for this disaster. <br /> <br /> On the film itself, which can be summarized as this: <br /> <br /> It consists of Madonna jumping around like a spoiled teenager who lost her way. She tries to impress this absolute shower by an actor playing the "lawyer" in the movie. But the best part was the end. I stared with my jaw on the ground on television as the credits rolled by thinking of myself, "That's it? That's the end? What a piece of sh * t!". If Madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this movie, this movie would ruin his career individually. And the funniest thing in the whole situation was that I just looked at the foreground movie to see where they put the song "Who's That Girl". Well, guess where they put it? ............................ .......at the end!
