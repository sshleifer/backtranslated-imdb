A show about an incredibly stupid, man-child and his sharp, warm wife. 99% of the land is about Doug does something incredibly stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tells his wife she emasculates him and then it is up to the father-in-law (Arthur: the typecast character from Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation. <br /> <br /> And the authors dare say it was influenced by "Honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the drawings are drawn from real-life situations unless you live in a cave, you know it's not true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's just put it this way. If Kevin James had been thin, the show would have been canceled from the pilot. If you are 12 or you love fat jokes. Be my guest, watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies). <br /> <br /> I noticed some posters compared to this travesty to much superior shows like friends, Seinfeld and everyone loved Raymond - I still wonder how anyone could do it
