4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo I can't wait 2 come on dis show and roll up as the club n make it really 905 style sensible models n bottles, son! No, I'm just for fun. This is a sad show, created by and for the pleasure of sad men. Men who are so neutralized by the modern existence that they channel their frustration into the clubs, triggering fleeting self-validating prey on chickens hoping to get their little Viennese touched to try to throw the sting of loneliness and make them feel itself if just for one night, as if their place on the board of the sausage party in Toronto is a little less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read some comments on this, saying that this show represents Canadian television that finally goes up to level with American TV or something else. Well, that is no purpose at all. It's like, yes! Pat yourself in the back, Canada - you've finally blown the elusive formula for such groundbreaking American content as "Studs," "Change of Heart," "Elimidate," and "The Fifth Wheel". See, the real brainchild here is tackling "... meets Candid Camera" on the pitch. Geni. And there is nothing that stretches on the thin line between fratboy companionship and latent homosexuality as a group of adult men who bind each other on a hidden camera and admire each other's "games" up in the club. The man-love on the screen here is so tangible, they should really consider redesigning the "Keys to the Steam Bath". <br /> <br /> On a page note how interesting that the people who gave this show so glowing reviews seem to have registered an IMDb account for the express purpose of doing so (I think I'm guilty of using the same means to do the opposite here.) My personal favorite is the one enthusiastic proofreader who claims to hail from "the United States" who skips it "Now it is clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television. " <br /> <br /> Smooth. <br /> <br /> But why disturb yourself online buzz? You Can't Be Canceled - You're Comedy Network in Canada, Baby! The view public will continue to ignore your show for years to come. In all likelihood, you will just be fine, comfortably coincide with the sumptuous mediocrity with the majority of the Comedy network's original programming.
