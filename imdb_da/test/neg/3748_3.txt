First of all, if you want to make a good movie, do not tie your entire exhibition in the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be confused for almost two hours, only to have Margas's father explain everything to Alex very late in the film. To make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided that it was not enough to get the basic mystery resolved, but added in a completely unnecessary murder we didn't know about (involving Alex's father!). There are some serious motivation issues with signs too. Margas father's choice does not seem to make sense when the film is over. Why did he just kill Philip's father and finish it? Instead, a complicated plot to explain the truth is perceived, but one that ensures that everyone will be in physical danger for many years (including the completely innocent photographer being murdered by Philip's father's dangers). Although Alex is a doctor (who is believed to be relatively light), he chooses to flee the police, where he not only threatens his own life, but those he involves in a spooky pile on the highway. Why was Margo's friend so eager to keep his promise to Margo when all the guys hit Alex's tab? And should we think that Margas father would rather kill himself than go to jail? What about his wife? Did she consider her wishes? These are some of the biggest problems. <br /> <br /> There are some unpleasant details like: Why was her father there the night of his false death? How did he get hold of the junkie's body at such a short notice and get it back quickly to bury it with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems convinced to be part of the chaos, where he and his friends will kill Alex, regardless of the perceived debt he owes to Alex to save his son's life. What good would Margo's pictures do? They do not involve Philippe at all. And why would Margo get the key to being practical because she would be abductors to take? Have I missed some other things? Probably. Minor irritations of mine include the fact that although Alex is a doctor, he smokes as an enemy. Which makes his marathon run away from the police even more impressive. Also, when driving in the convertible with his lawyer, none of them also has a seat belt. How bright could they be?
