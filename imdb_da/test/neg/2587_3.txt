Debra Winger's 1987 "Black Widow" is much better. <br /> <br /> This is like a lame version and Jane Seymour usually does it better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is also pretty poor in this too. Just play his usual role as a boring rebellious child. Perhaps both of them were from Dr. Quinn managed to get us excited. <br /> <br /> If it's on, take a copy of "Black Widow".
