I was very pleased with this as I was a big fan of the book. But when it came out, I remember that it was one of the biggest waste of money and time I have ever spent at the cinema. In principle, the play, the sets and the music were excellent, and is the main reason why I rate this for a 4. <br /> <br /> In this version Sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as "not just evil but vulgar". <br /> <br /> There is too much of a Disneyfied ending for me; Sara's father returns from the dead, and everyone goes into Indian sunset. While the book has a happy (and critics can say just as unlikely) it doesn't stop letting you think, "Oh puh-leeze." <br /> <br /> The only thing that was true to the book was: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father is a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("Do you teach me the heart ? "/" No. I know you by heart. You are in my heart. ") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky and her 'adoption' Lottie (although this latter was not developed as much as it could have been) 4 Changing her room by adding different luxury items. That part was done brilliantly. 5. The core - a rich girl is suddenly thrown into poverty - is there, but it's all about it. People can say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Optionally. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​- ages 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a 'feel-good' family movie, then deliver it. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of a little princess (in fact, if you've read the book), don't play time with this. It's such a shame; With a roll like this, if they had at least the basic story, it could have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> I resented about 'reading the book' this and 'reading the book' as a little too much? Very likely. But if someone tries to adapt a book - especially such a classic - to a movie, then they should at least have done the same. Preferably more than once.
