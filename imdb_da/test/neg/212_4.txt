Disappointing heist movies actually, I actually expected a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going through the movie and it has few of these cat and mouse stuff going on, but it was just pretty stupid. And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer, if you actually saw the trailer for this, then you saw pretty much the whole movie because it's just predictable. So basically, it's about a few armored truck companies trying to steal the $ 42 million they suspect to transport until one of their members grows a conscience. I thought the movie would be better with the cast of well-known actors, but I was wrong. I mean, it's not necessarily a bad movie, but it just wasn't as good or has any depth. This is definitely a rental at best, just not really worth seeing in theaters. hoist <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
