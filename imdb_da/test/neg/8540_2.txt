Good old Jess Franco! The always reliable choice of director if you are looking for indispensable sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess has once again surpassed herself with this absolutely scary piece of jungle "adventure". Let's see, this movie is basically just an excuse to have the incredibly hot (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. In fact, it is a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a movie set naked in front of an entire crew member and especially before the eyes of perverted Franco! And it wasn't even the first time since the duo previously made "Linda" together. Anyways, just in case you wondered: YES, "Diamonds of Kilimanjaro" have a plot, albeit a very imbecilic. During the opening sequences, a plane carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child crash in the middle of an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because at some point in the film they never even try to consume human flesh. The unpleasant Scot declares himself the great white leader, and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and barely dressed white goddess. Several years later, an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and ?? More importantly - stealing some of the tribal legendary diamonds. This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie, but of course, Jess Franco couldn't be bothered. Why shoot jungle hunting sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily target your camera on a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle settings simply appear to be recorded in someone else's garden, and there is a massive amount of clumsy edited National Geographic wildlife footage to fill the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Kilimanjaros diamonds" as a brilliant, feminist and adult-oriented version of Tarzan. Yes, right, they just put that sentence there because Katja Bienert's character turns from one tree to another using a couple of times.
