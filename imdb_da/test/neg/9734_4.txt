Oh boy. Movies like this really bother me. If this movie is supposed to close the truth, I suppose Rommel knew Hitler some time before World War II started. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed from before. Now I can't imagine that Rommel would not have known anything about Hitler's government policies, so Rommel must share a great deal of guilt for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life finally a tragic one. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him? I can not do it. Nor can I buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war, the Allies would have had more trouble winning it. If several competent persons were responsible, WWII could never have started in the first place. From a film-viewing aspect, the film jumps from place to place, and most of it seems to be a story special with big-name actors playing the historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has a few good scenes with James Mason, and I liked that everyone spoke English without the ridiculous accents. But apart from that not very important.
