I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow-up to John Landi's classic comedy horror movie from 1981. I guess you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie, as history's bare bones steal elements from the one in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital, he closely survives a werewolf attack killing a colleague, he begins (Pardon the pun) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession he becomes a werewolf he has visited of accusations of his dead victims, etc. and reading the previous line I just discovered how much the story has in common with the original, that it seems much like it. The difference lies in how entertaining and entertaining the Landis movie is <br /> <br /> With this Paris-based movie, there are no scenes that really stand out. There is no naked man waking up in a zoo and wondering how to come home without money or clothing. There is no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves, and there is no spectacular climax. AAWIP is trying to be fun, but is there anything more embarrassing than unsuccessful humor? I think of the stage where Andy McDermott must convince someone that he has gum in his pocket and not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there is no poignancy involved in this questionable follow-up. You really feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie, here you just feel that Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through a literature's written movements. There are also a large number of plot holes visible. Is this the first time the Lunar Club has performed a massacre? If not, are there not large quantities equal to hearts torn out in the world's press? Why didn't the police get leaders? <br /> <br /> Everyone else has mentioned it and I will too - visually poor. Look at the bungee-jumping scene at The Eifell Tower, it is painfully obvious that it has been achieved through some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is made by some very cartoon-like CGI. I will not put Anthony Waller in the same seizure as Stephen Sommers as an instructor who completely destroys a movie because of an overloaded dependence on CGI (The main problem with AAWIP is the manuscript combined with a high degree of expectation from those who saw 1981 movie classic) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to wonder that the budget may not extend so far. But at the end of the day, it's a pretty bad horror movie that didn't have to be made, and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment
