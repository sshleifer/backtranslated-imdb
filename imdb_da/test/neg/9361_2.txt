A woman finds herself caught in a seemingly inexplicable rash of suicide. So again, are these really suicides? It looks like there's a ghost on it loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves with head or arms twisted this way or so, giving a very strange look. Recurring themed music plays from unexpected places to announce the ghost's arrival, and bizarre sound effects - resembling the sound of small twigs being snapped - always accompany this effortless spirit. Is there any of this known? Well, if you've seen a couple of Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, it should. Very heavy and effortless from "The Ring", "One Last Call" and a few other recent horror hits, this movie tries to carry an uninteresting and worn plot for a climax, but we've seen it all before. Avoid it unless you are desperate or have not seen other Asian horror movies for the past 10 years.
