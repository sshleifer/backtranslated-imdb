If you like bad SE, (some) bad acting and a total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. So a really cheap looking movie, but I liked it anyway. Why? Because I like those movies. I can't help but smile when I see these kinds of movies ....... What were the producers, actors, directors and SEs thinking when making this movie? Don't expect an "Abyss" or "Alien", just a (very) low budget horror / adventure movie. <br /> <br /> There is a good "splatter" moment when a guy's head is shot off, but for the most part the horror is pretty pretty. The final monster is also pretty cool. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes long so you can't go wrong there. Maybe you can pick it up at your local video store or watch it on TV. I'm sure you want to see it. <br /> <br /> Don't say you weren't warned .............
