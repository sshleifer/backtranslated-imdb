This game was terrible. I think they've worked too hard on visuals and didn't do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I think the pictures look amazing, but is the game really "fun"? NONE! I think it's like "hi let's jump from buildings" and everything I do stops and A / X. The game just isn't there and I don't agree with what Ubisoft did because they had this hot girl (the player of the game, Jade Raymond) and they were like "OK, we have this hot girl, let's pimp her" and if you go to game sites, you will not see the gameplay of Assassin's Creed, you want to see her face with a microphone, and it becomes like "We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies!" It's like man, close F * @ K UP, who cares?! Apparently ... many people do because they bought the game and like it ... I mean comparing this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that really does not abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and delivers in the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They could do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still great, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded great, and it's a game that deserves this year's game. NOT Assassin's Creed, man, it doesn't even deserve to be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. Hype around this game where it was like "oh it's the next generation of gaming" .... really? I do not think! So let me get this right here because I think the people think about this game, just like it because they are Jade fans, so I will tell you, JADE WILL NOT DO WITH YOU OR USE THAT OR LOVE THIS GAME! If you want a real game on PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune if you want a real game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games too) and if you want a real game just in all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know that this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, pressing two buttons to do all this cool stuff, is it really a fun game? The only reason other games make it more complicated is that after that it becomes more innovative and fun. And this game just isn't. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 A living hell!
