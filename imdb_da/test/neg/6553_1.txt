Sherman Hemsley was great in Jefferson's and especially everyone in the family. He was also very good at Amen, why on earth would he make this movie? This movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does the best he can, but it is terrible. This movie was the beginning of bankruptcy for Sherman Hemsley. I think he's a lot of fun, but it's a terrible horrible pointless ghost story. Stick with Ghostbusters.
