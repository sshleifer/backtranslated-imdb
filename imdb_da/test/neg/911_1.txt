Rob Lowe must have eaten the entire budget, but I can't fault him for running the money. Even he would agree there was nothing good about this movie. Filming, editing, direction, dialogue, set, makeup, writing, casting (especially the young girl and cheating child psychiatry), and the story all was just the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Send this one to any other rental option, or find yourself shouting out malicious comments on the TV. Dead Silent should be plotted forever.
