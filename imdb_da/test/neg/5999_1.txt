I just can't see what everyone sees in this movie. The action is just awful, the choice of music is, mildly setting it, peculiar, there are not enough fighting situations, the plot is non-existent, and what little entertainment one could get from this movie is destroyed by the annoying way some of the film is filmed and gives you a split head.
