I've watched this movie twice over the last six months (what I'm going through so you don't have to). The first view left me half crazy and babbling. The second view at 5am on a rainy morning was a little better. only screamed in pain once. <br /> <br /> Seems Pocona (The Aztec Mummy) had hots for a particular Aztec princess who was to "keep her girl". Of course they gave each other the store and were put to death for it. (Now it's serious!). But before they are the film, we try to put ourselves to death with a brilliant aztec ceremony. The singing will make your ears soft. In any case, there is usual reincarnation nonsense. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate and bracelet guarded by the slung slop, Pocona. At this time, Pocona looks like he's been on a 2000 year leg and is after the pampering of his grave. His desires and moans sound like he has a bad case of Montezuma's revenge (or he reads the manuscript of this movie). It will make your breath stink. An evil dr. Von Krupp appears to have Aztec's tax (possibly to fund plays and writing courses for caste and crew). His name is The Bat, because in his curse of Aztec Mummy he had a bat like cape, hat and something like a foam mask over his face. Well, it's better than the Laughing Fat Man. <br /> The benefit of the typical mad scientist wants to rule the world. He emphasizes this by rolling his eyes, laughing maniacally and chewing the landscape. He has paved an invincible robot. Similar to 'the bot was made of a trash can, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 Buick. This will make your eyes sound. A company even takes credit to make this canned! The mighty showdown between Pocona and Robot takes place in Mummy's new crypt that has been homeless previously. <br /> <br /> About half of this movie has been deleted from "La Aztec Momia", which was never released in the United States in its original form, but in a choppy cruelty by Jerry Warren (see my "Attack Of The Mayan Mummy ") and" The Defeat of the Aztec Mummy ". The robot is honestly stupid, like most characters. If that and the plot doesn't make you laugh with laughter, nothing will. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad it would have got one. But after seeing "Mayan Mummy" (which is a movie deserved to be burned) and seeing "Robot" again, it gets a 3. You have to see this without any expectations. Then it can be naively comfortable.
