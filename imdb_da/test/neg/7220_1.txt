This TV show is an idiotic waste of time if you want to learn <br /> <br /> the animals see the discovery channel. If you want to see <br /> <br /> nincompoops on TV, just watch MTV. MTV stands for music TV <br /> <br /> not nitwit D-list's preforming retarded sketches or bratty kids crying <br /> <br /> their hearts not to get a BMW for that 16th birthday. I know <br /> <br /> that if you like this show, I know you love viva la Bam and jackass huh? I think my IQ dropped ten points on this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two shows jackass and animal planet <br /> <br /> Some people find it a good combination. On the other hand, I think it's retarding. <br /> <br /> And if you notice much like jackass <br /> <br /> and viva la Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is horrible
