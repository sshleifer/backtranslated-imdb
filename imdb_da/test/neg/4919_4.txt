'A New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot on author John G. Jones premise on a subject taken from the Long Island House, which causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. But it is also the first Amityville page 'Possession' to tie directly to the real life events that started the whole series. This time, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is an incomparable mirror of a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him begin to die, which eventually leads to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville House - a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in Amityville II) murdered his entire night all night. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is not entirely coincidental, and he quickly learns the truth of his past a truth he has kept buried since childhood. This 7th tranche in the often worn franchise is a disappointment to me. Things began to pick up the stupid and uneven, but entertaining 'It's About Time', and considering how much this movie is trying to draw on its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. <br /> <br /> But three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville House with yet another explanation for malignant paranormal visitations carries me, at least. One of the biggest weaknesses in the Amityville franchise is the firm determination of each set of manufacturers to completely ignore all other episodes in the series. On the one hand, it is quite reasonable that they will not be bound to others' continuity, but at least they may recognize stories that have already been done and possibly * not repeat them over and over again *. <br /> <br /> There is also something that rather plodding on the way history unfolds, undoubtedly because of the inevitability that this repeat party brings. As you already know what will happen, it is carefully building up simply slow and dull. Or maybe it's just boring anyway. Director John Murlowski could probably have done more to increase the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply making it blink red and emit chattering 'evil' voices lacking any subtlety. There were times when characters seemed rather untouched by their other world skills. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? <br /> <br /> It's a shame because 'A new generation' has a more than capable of throwing. I had to stop watching this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She imprisoned my attention just as she always does, and if anything I was annoyed, her part was no more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was just charismatic and again underused. Partridge in the main role clearly fits in with the early 90's upper-carved lumber-necked t-shirt-jawed hero-type, and although I'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas need, it's not like anyone here is performing Ibsen. /> <br /> The kits are also worth noting from the dramatic illustration that fills Suki's room to the claustrophobic corridors highlighted in flashback / supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these rights is particularly important considering how certain sequences are repeated throughout the movie for simulated fragmented memories. Obviously, Murlowski is more a visual instructor rather than either an actor's instructor or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is supposed to be a horror movie. "A new generation" sees the same race that is being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it really was needed, and the whole effort fails to stand as high as it should. However, it must be recognized for its strong ties to the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. In fact, the ideal person for this is a person who has not seen any of the past 'The Possession' for whom the story will not be such a massive deja-vu trip.
