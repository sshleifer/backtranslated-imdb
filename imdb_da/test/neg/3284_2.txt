I cringed when I heard the first can of laughing tracks in the first few seconds of the show, yet I gave it a try. You know when a person offers a line that is just a little entertaining, and you hear an overtly false laughter exploding in eerie laughter that it's a show aimed at morons to tell "yes it's fun, go and laugh" . <Br /> <br /> Ugh. I couldn't hold this show as it revealed itself. I can't speak for everyone - in fact some people like the IDIOTIC show "Stacked" (which makes me throw up). I can imagine that those who like "Stacked" might also like this drive. Some people still get a kick out of the old "pull my finger" gag. For me, this show is almost as witty - and almost as original. <br /> <br /> The themes were old and tired. The witnesses were paralyzed and chopped. The characters were the ones we've seen everywhere before - and the worst of anyone you might imagine. So ... if you like things like burping words and neighbors who say "pull my finger" ... You really like this show. Otherwise ... pass it by. It's stupid - and not in a smart or original way. This is about as old and tired as any performance has ever been at its premiere.
