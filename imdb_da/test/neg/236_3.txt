Like a lot of movies involving small children, this starts "really sweet" and looks like ... and then it turns around after approx. half an hour. This is certainly the case here in This Time Travel Story (which I usually love), where an adult meets a child whom he really is in the age of eight years! Great premise and a great main actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... The child "Rusty" is a smart aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as "Russell" becomes abrasive with his constant shouting. It's entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> Young Breslin has become a very good children's actor involved in a number of films, including "The Cat In The Hat" for a more famous children's actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> All in all, a disappointing movie, especially with all the good news, got this movie when it was released.
