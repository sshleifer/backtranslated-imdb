This movie was shot using a digital camera and it shows. There were probably annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, also using a horrible score. As if that wasn't enough, the play was also terrible. Now in Hartley's movie, the play is always special, but here it was just BAD, especially of Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank goodness) can't say much. After all these external problems, it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not so good either. The witnesses are predictable and incredibly straightforward, and the events include only one incident to the next. The so-called life book with Armageddon inside is not much more than an excuse to see actors fighting to say their lines. All in all, this movie is a waste of time and money and effort. Thumbs down.
