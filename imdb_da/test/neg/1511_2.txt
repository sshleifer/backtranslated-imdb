(As a note I would like to say that I saw this movie in my annual church camp where the whole youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf a year later, if only for humor I am derived from a poor attempt to make an evangelical movie. <br /> <br /> Lay it Down is lacking in many movie fans' expectations on several different levels. Most of the problems lie within the impersonal play. Regardless of the beautiful cars in the movie or the truth of Christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie and witness tool, it hardly lives. <br /> <br /> Most good opinions of the films are supported by Christians who agree on the message. While it is easy for a Christian to agree with the points provided, the audience hardly witnesses life outside a clich√©. The battle situation between Ben and his brother is terribly baptized. And there are at least three blatant styles in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> I urge anyone to watch the movie once with the director's comment. It really helps you understand why the movie was written, how it was. The director's view of the secular society is practically the opposite of what would satisfy a filmmaker's needs: he shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, he admits, was hasty but "satisfying"; he thought the overused transitions and themes were effective; and was completely satisfied with the actor. <br /> <br /> He also added motifs that he was pretty proud of: -All (read: most) of names are significant. Ben Destin = "Be Destined", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car that makes donuts is symbolic of the circling nothing that is a life without Christ. - When Ben leaves Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross". <br /> <br /> I don't make any of them. He throws around such things in between and says, while street racers and the like "blow their brains out with weapons" and how "God is in control when you are born and when you die". Yes, it wasn't a writing field. He really says it. <br /> <br /> I have (small) forgiveness reserved for this movie. The "cool cars" and "good message" don't make jack to make this movie good. However, the film was made by a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1/1000 of "The Fast and the Furious's", and the deadline was unforgivable. With that in mind, I give it a score of 2/10, instead of 1/10 I think so high that it deserves it.
