Deformed, aged female scientist kills co-founder to steal cell rejuvenation formulas and reverse the aging process. She takes it and becomes the beautiful evil Satanic (Magda Konopka) who walks around, seduces and murders wealthy businessmen. She dresses very stylishly at the end of the 60s against clothes and manipulates them around her and looks a lot like the late Marisa Mell from the DIABOLIK movie. Coincidence <br /> <br /> But despite all this, it is amateurish and sloppy without the James Bond pop-art gadgetry that DIABOLIK had. Even Madrid and the Lake Geneva movie sites do nothing for it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada & Roberto Pregadio and it is not bad at all that lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar is used as a decoration. Perfect for one of the European Loungecore CDs that came out in the 90s. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD also uses a subterranean grain color print that is in poor shape, with an explanation in the beginning that says this was due to the age of the film. Bull! They either didn't interfere with finding a better source, or they couldn't find one at all. There are only a few still images of Magda, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Dull and poor around, this gets a 3 out of 10.
