I have tried to see this show on several occasions, and it turned out to be completely pale of humor every time. The reason to mention one thing is that it is based solely on ridicule that the Republicans have finished. In short, it is basically democratic party political positions spied as humor. <br /> <br /> All Mr Stewart makes it unclear about something the Republicans have done, and the audience is moving in forced laughter. <br /> <I guess the left is devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves according to how much they all hate Republicans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My beliefs: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
