This movie is horrible and horrible. It's not a low budget, it's a no budget movie that makes Ed Wood's movie look like art. The action is spooky, but sets and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has a bullet and combat scenes shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism that you would expect from an 80's Italian video nasty. No talent was used to make this movie. And the female love interest has a huge bhind-Italian taste perhaps. Even for 80's Italian standards, this movie is pretty awful, but I think it came out at a time when there were not so many movies available on video or viewers were not really discerning. This piece of crap has no entertainment value at all, and it's not even fun, just boring and extremely cheap. It is actually and offends the most stupid audience. I just wonder how an actor like Woody Strode ended up being a turkey like this one?
