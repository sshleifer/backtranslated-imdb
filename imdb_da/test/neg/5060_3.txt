After spending the six years previously written and produced, Luc Besson returns to the chairman of the board with Angel-A. I'm a big fan of Léon, and liked the prospect of a black and white French movie from the same chap. <br /> <br /> André is a liar and gambling addict due to money for almost every loan shark in Paris. Without repaying his debt and having a hard time staying over the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decides to kill himself. He happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman whom he decides to save. Determined to thank him, she begins to help him correct his own life. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some laughs that run smoothly. Visualsne is quite nice and works well with the sights of Paris. But it is. That's all the movie has got for it. And these two facets can't do anything to hold back the horrible movie that makes the movie free. Although I can't celebrate the main character (his inconsistencies are dense, though), the lonely one is horrible. An awful screen presence and bitterly annoying. The reason is ridiculously inconsistent though, and sometimes bizarre silly, especially the end; an end that completely blew the forgetful redemption created by the scenes immediately before it. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene I've experienced is that it is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic, and significantly too terrible to be "so bad, it's funny". The overall premise of the movie might have once held potential, but it is brutally massacred by the infinitely horrific execution of its ideas. The movie was really a task to look at, and one that made me scream on the screen all the way through. <br /> <br /> Massively and immensely flawed, Angel-A is just bad. Although the occasional fun dialogue manages to draw chortles at rare intervals, it is finally clear that this movie is no more than contradictory.
