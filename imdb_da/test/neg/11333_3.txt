I fail to understand why anyone would allow a subordinate director to float on celluloid. This film has already been made at least two other times that were better than this ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans could have been some good skating done by a professional cast skater, but it just doesn't happen. The closest thing the audience is watching good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a walk on the ice in a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and do not make any skates at all. There are not very real emotions shown and there is not really any reason to tune into this course Made-For-TV Movie. My advice: Rent the original.
