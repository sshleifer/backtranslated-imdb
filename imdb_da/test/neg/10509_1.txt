This movie actually made me cry. <br /> <br /> For starters the false teeth. Then you can see a good plastic or set of sets. To make it even more boring, all actions are followed by a strong flash of light. So the speakers: The sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, so too soft, never as good as in good movies. It also echoes so much that I think they had a microphone on the whole set. And to make matters worse, ever heard of stereo? If the camera changes, the sound will always remain centered. The actors speak as if they are reading from a board staged behind the camera. And to zoom into another scene, how terribly childish. <br /> <br /> The music is so poorly chosen that it never adds anything. It only destroys an unfortunate created tension. <br /> <br /> To end it, the scenes are fighting ... my 3 year old niece would make a better fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't even good at a laugh, it's just so bad ...
