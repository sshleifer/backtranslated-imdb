As Americans, we have come to expect bias as "couples for the course" when it comes to HORROR and unknown directors who run unknown actors acting for unknown authors. We really expect this to suck and when they are not sucking it becomes an overnight success. <br /> <br /> This is NOT an overnight success, nor is it a weekend or a month's success. This blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this: Go to this knowledge, it sucks, enjoy it for what it is, for what it is & if you have something better to do, keep it on the back WAY BACK burner. It is entertaining in the way of seeing the elderly on a busy street during rush hour, but don't expect much - they are almost never hit by a real car, it's just a lot of hoopla.
