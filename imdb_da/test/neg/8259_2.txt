What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a movie. The scripture is full of holes from the beginning to the end. Coherent, not coherent ... completely ridiculous. One of the most talented / beautiful actresses in the world (and I am talking about Nastasia Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse, she suspects coloring her hair halfway through the movie, but it's obvious she just has a cheap black wig bought from a dragon queen costume store. The best moments are given to an actor and his dog in the apartment who leads actress Peter Coyote live in. Fairuza Balk is photographed poorly to start. She looks like an overweight freshman who is spiked on many all-you-can-eat student cafeteria buffets. I looked forward to this movie. I wanted to like it, but I think I'd rather see Nastassja reading the phone book with her own hair.
