I was so disappointed with this movie. I am very familiar with the matter, having not only read Mark Fuhrman's book, but also the far superior "A wealth of evil: The true story of the murder of Martha Moxley in America's richest community" by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who sees MURDER IN GREENWICH must be aware that they see the Mark Fuhrman story, not the Martha Moxley story. This movie is no more than an ego tour for Fuhrman. Just see his character star around, as if he is the second coming (yes, even being emitted by women). The actors playing the kids look too old for their roles, and flashbacks to the 1970s are quite convincing. If anyone is up to this story, it is Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman went into it to make a name for himself. They and Martha deserve to have the true story told.
