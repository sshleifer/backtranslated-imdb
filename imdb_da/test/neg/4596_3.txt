Rented this from my local Blockbuster under the title SPECK - it can be the way to look if you still feel you need to look after this review. It's a serial killer Richard Speck movie, killing several nurses in Chicago in the 60s. When you watch the movie, you get the feeling that it follows the crimes in the letter. Unfortunately, it doesn't make a good movie. Another problem I had was the almost constant music that told us that this was a SCARY MOVIE and some scary stories that let us know what's motivating Speck. The action was average for this type of movie; To give credit where credit is due, the film is very beautifully photographed to my liking. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are interested in the subject, it may be worth your time.
