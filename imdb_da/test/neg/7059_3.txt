It didn't take too long after Halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by persistent mediocrity. As early as 1983, the genre was already fighting to release more than three decent deals per year. Years, and by '88, the stalk and the slash had become quite a lot of the scream movie's whip. At that time, large studios were all aware that repetition of the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction that left it to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that John Carpenter had created. Although there were still an impressive number of features that hit shelves in 88, most of them were low-produced and taken as a whole, they were extremely unpleasant. With that said there were a few gems among the rubble. Scott Spiegel's burglar in his unfit shape was a fantastic gross classic, while Evil Dead Trap showed that the bike was not completely empty of style and panache. William Lustig's Maniac Cop was successful enough to start a franchise and two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage turned out to be the last enchanting weather features in the scary category. It was the ongoing release of schlock as Berserker, Blood Lake and Rush Week, which cursed the slasher movie for eight years of obscurity. It finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of Wes Craven's Scream to provide the necessary revival. Since I hadn't heard of Demon Warrior before I came across the unexpected, I immediately assumed that it was part of the low pandemic waste that led to the slump in the slasher phase. But with that said the movie boasts an exciting premise that sits comfortably next to Scalps and Camping Del Terrore as another welcome addition to the native-American influenced catalog. <br /> <br /> A truck pulls up on a forest road and out two ridiculously dramatized rednecks. Hillbilly loggers are only on the screen for ten seconds, and they are murdered by an invisible danger. Then we meet a troupe of five young adults heading to the same place for a place of shotgun targeting on some of the local wildlife. The area is owned by Neil Willard and has been passed through three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the country from an Indian medicine man who was rumored to have left a curse on the property. According to legend, a Demon Warrior with an extreme hatred of humanity every ten years derives the forest harvest revenge upon those whom he considers responsible for the tribe of tribes. It wouldn't be much fun if these myths were a lie, as regular as clockwork shows a madman with a taste for blood. Will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer ??? Demon Warrior is best described as a major budgeted (but still wildly cheap) resume of Fred Olen Ray's Scalps. The bogey of both films is almost identical, and the director even throws a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. Things start promising with a crisp Friday's 13-year-old first-person filmography and a couple of rods composed of the subtleties of director Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway did a good job of photographing, and the tribal trump point provides a refreshing change from the more traditional late-eighties synthesizers. Syringes are equivalent to a few trustworthy management imprints, and there are even a few attempts at humor. The killer looked successful in demon dressing and involving an bow and arrow, as the main killer weapon was a fat touch from the director. Fred Olen Ray's infamous slasher was remarkable for his strong and credible disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite being produced twice, the Demon Warrior never gets close to the movie it so desperately emulates. Rumor has it that the majority of the actors were drafted from Texas Baylor University and were not even paid for their inclusion in the function, so of course it goes without saying that the drama is appropriate abysmal. I especially enjoyed the hilarious John Langione ?? an italian indian (don't ask) that portrays as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. Warrior started with some credible glimpse of the panache from the director, which actually made me believe this could be a welcome inclusion in the slasher index. Unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of hideous plays and one end picked directly from stupidsville seriously the original plan I had in mind for a rating. It's a shame that the dramas were then scraped from the bottom of the thespian barrel because the Demon Warrior sometimes showed flashes of potential. Patterson's movie is all a mixed bag of ideas ?? some of them were good, but mostly they were staggeringly mediocre. Because this was released at a time when the slash genre had become the water to avoid the scissors happy censors, there really is no way worth mentioning. Even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to Olen Ray's graphic depiction. Demon Warrior has the odd moment of credibility, but not often enough to justify a purchase. Not as bad as the aforementioned Berserker, Blood Lake et al, but not really that good either ??
