Evil never looked so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When a friend of mine chose this DVD up to a half price bookstore, I didn't know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth laughing, but I didn't understand how ridiculous it really would be. <br /> <br /> The first time I missed a part of the dialogue (if you could call it that) because we were too busy to poker fun on the movie. It looked like it was written in the film in less than a week and they didn't have the budget to go back and fix some of the minor bugs. Wait, did I say "less"? I meant the exact opposite. For example, the protagonist is credited as 'Ken', but several times throughout the film he is called 'John'. <br /> <br /> If the plot holes are not enough fun for you, take a play. No one seems too concerned about zombie raids in their state, including the mother of the main character who is missing for days while sitting in front of a fireplace reading a book. The limitations on the budget put on the film are just as fun. Maybe they didn't have permission for movies where they were, because during BIG MOTORCYCLE CHASE SCENE, the drivers follow all traffic rules. In fact, the zombies who had just killed twenty or so people stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot. I don't even do that, but then again I'm not a biker zombie. The end of the movie looks like they just run out of money. It all ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more ... At second thought it just ends as fast enough. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a good time with your friends, try this movie. It's a big accidental comedy.
