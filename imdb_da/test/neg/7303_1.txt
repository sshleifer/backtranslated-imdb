Ed Woods Classic 'Plan 9' has for many years been the worst movie ever made. Forget the Seven Roller Blades are infinitely worse. The cast is made up of famous people's brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. The reason along with budget and script are non-existent. Driving time is not made in the classic Ed Wood style with the use of stock footage. Instead, there is endless slow motion and repetitive action. And for Roller Blade Seven, not even seven of them! <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie just to know how bad filmmaking really can be. Provides independent filmmakers everywhere hope.
