I have read many reviews on IMDb (well, all five of them written at the time I write this) and I am surprised at the amount of praise built on The Brideless Groom, which is undoubtedly one of the smaller comedies by Stooges. I prefer the elderly, where it was Larry, Curly and Moe, although Shemp gets the credit for most of the fun scenes in the Sing a Song of Six Pants, another Stooges card that is only moderately fun but far better than Brideless Groom. In fact, there is a single slightly entertaining scene in the movie, "Don't-hit-a-lady" scene, which is hardly entertaining and is 15 minutes in the movie. Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. Shemp is a voice coach whose uncle has passed away and left him a $ 500,000 legacy, provided he is married within 48 hours, which is briefly enough to note, but when Shemp learns about it, he has only 7 hours back. This is a premise that had been done and redone before, but wasn't, I don't think, a massive cliché at the time this movie was made as it is now. There are a number of gags throughout the film, none of which are just close to the level of comedy, for which the three stooges are so commonly known. It seems that Stooges has hit the same problems that plagued so many of the Shirley Temple films ?? There is too little dependence on content and too much addiction just because they are there. <br /> <br /> The standard characteristics of Stooges are here, Moe is the middle, whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this movie, and slapstick sound effects (though with more exceptions than usual) are rather entertaining but are connected to their standard slots in this movie. The "hold hands you lovebirds" line is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. <br /> <br /> There is much talk among the others who have reviewed this film to this page that this is one of the best of Stooges shorts that you do not find a weak moment on how this are their best since the early 30s shorts. It's just not true. I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for landmark classics and for the giants of early comedy that the three stooges are certainly, but that respect is damaged when poor movies are praised more than they should be. The Brylløs groom deserves some respect because it is a Stooges movie, but for the very same reason it should have been better. The three stooges were just better than this.
