My Age: 13 Keats, played by Damon Wayans and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are the best friends and have been for a year. What Moses doesn't know is that Keats is really Jack Carter, an undercoat struggle waiting for the right time to bust Moses and Frank Colton, a great criminal in which Moses is involved. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a policeman, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he comes away after shooting Carter in the head who does not kill Carter. Moses is found by the police and is taken as evidence of Colton's misdemeanor. But when the police, including Carter, are escorting him across the country on a plane, all the other police are killed, and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter must remain alive and take in Moses. <br /> <br /> A pretty average action comedy, Bulletproof has a fair plot, but much of the movie is simply stupid. For a comedy I found most of the jokes completely unfunny. But as an action movie, it has a couple of relatively good action scenes. Not being a good fan of either Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found the play and therefore the characters far below par. The climax is not really good, and the film is so unrealistic. It's not quite bad, but not too good, and it's too short. Runs for less than 85 minutes, even though there was another 15 minutes left before it ended, but it was not and the movie was too short. Overall not a complete waste of time, but I still wouldn't recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: Intermediate Violence, Sexual References, Medium Level Rough Languages ​​<br /> <br /> Rating: 56 out of 100
