If there is a word I can attach to this movie, it is "embarrassment". It must be embarrassing for anyone involved with the movie to actually see it in a theater. Everything - the manuscript, the manuscript, the dialogues, the lyrics, the direction - the foam, miserable. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie when I was a kid. Would like it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superhero movie. It's a not-so-explored genre in Hindi cinema. The trial deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been busy making the film. Can't understand the reason behind the expulsion of foreigners like Hindi-speaking characters who can't even get the synchronization right (nothing to say about dubbing). The play is terrible. The editing even more. If you follow the dialogues carefully, you can record grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely change the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. <br /> <br /> The biggest embarrassment should be for the Censor table. There are a few nip-slip scenes in the movie, one of which is quite clear (so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing group missed it. And the censorship board also missed it. So much for the non-innocent exposure-on-screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Can't think about why Amitabh played the part. It could be because he was a good friend to Kapoors. But the role hardly has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one. There are a few heroic scenes, really worthy. But otherwise they are embarrassingly incredible (for example, arrow capturing .. it might have been better with CGI, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Precisely Dimple and Sonam set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor provide an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairy-tale villain (lets the villain laugh sometimes). On the whole is an interesting concept. Could have been much better.
