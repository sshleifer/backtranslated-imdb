This movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, a little extra paint and cardboard, a toy ship, a couple of friends who have acted in community theater and the wrong notion you can make a movie. The end result is an automated time waster that you want to skip unless you take it out of the DVD player and throw it through the window first. <br /> <br /> The action in the opening scene (especially by the rat Lee Morgan as 'Captain') and the toy ship "crashes" into the rocks before the credits are a good indicator of what you are in for (with the whole foam seeing it It seems that this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink, I think Boyette expected to save some money by washing the dishes at the same time). In terms of poor cinema, the fun that "Dungeon of Harrow" seems to have inspired (perhaps randomly) the deviation of "Manos: The Hands of Fate" seems. Yep, that's the same lame "I was the victim, and now I take the evil villain's place" ironic ending. The bigger the irony is that two inappropriate, talented filmmakers could make two equally miserable Texas-filmed horror movies and get away with it. <br /> <br /> Monotonous geeks Russ Harvey is a noble in a large family line (why they were big never being broached), bored us while they regretted his family reign and crests death before his ship even broke (we also treats a droning tale throughout the film). Unfortunately, we are not so lucky. His family's toy ship crashes into some foam in a sink, and he's washed ashore with his inflated captain and a woman conveniently deposited on a crazy Count's island. At the same time, the count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a Blackstone's Magic Kit outfit, attacks him with various dolls (spiders, snakes, bats ... all the evil things). The Count (William McNulty) overcomes worse than Shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical crazy ranting. I would be angry, too, if I were to be in this disaster. The woman is immediately killed by the Count's gruesome dogs, and the two jerks are trapped by his servant. The Count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he beats his servants around much (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy being tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and a nurse, the rotting leper -A wedding dress Countess in the dungeon (she digs Nerdy Noble and is the only effective & scary thing in the movie), a lot of spooky dialogue at a dining table, blubbery Captain is killed while making a pathetic escape (sledge to see a sledge battle one pack lions. . . It's too ugly for me. I've spent most of my time on the forward link. <br /> <br /> Yet, the gentleman and the nurse make an escape and believe they are rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yes, we must believe in a lake is the sea). They do not when nerdy hair was crying and he scared they would save away. Honestly, I think they simply took the opportunity to shake off this hideous movie while they had the chance. They go back to the castle, the nurse begins to tear as a countess (and your stomach at this time), and we end up getting the two ready to get down. . DUNGEON OF HARROW !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I love old, miserable horror movies, but they need some kind of entertainment value. I feel skinned even at the low low price of $ 5.99 for this biscuit. The Mystery Science Theater would have a hard time making this fun. I was taken by a couple of nutty reviewers who claimed this movie had atmosphere and some creepy moments. Wrong! Avoid this tripe at all costs, and don't even waste money if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere. This movie makes Corman's "The Terror" like a horror and atmosphere masterpiece.
