My father insisted that I watch this movie with him, and I regret wasting my time watching - I want the approximate one and a half hours back! The "funny" little movie relates to the elderly Don Ameche, who lives with his son, Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not only "forgetful" as he has been told but has dementia (it seems very much like Alzheimer's). And because Dad is so often "out for lunch," he comes in so many problems over and over - almost like the sweet babe from BABY'S DAY OUT. The problem, however, is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is all imagination and the baby is going to be fine. Plus, you don't laugh at the baby for having a deformity or illness. But in this case, you are encouraged to laugh at a man who slowly loses his mind - and where is humor in it? If this movie had been more successful, manufacturers would have made movies to make fun or people with cerebral palsy or carnivorous virus?!?! There are many people who should have been ashamed of making this movie.
