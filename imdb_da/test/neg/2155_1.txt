There is no need to attempt to describe in detail the overdue, excessively melodramatic plot involving civil war bitterness, a crooked city chief, and other complications. It's all bad. Stella Stevens, Andrew Prine, Bo Svenson, William Smith, Tim Thomerson and Lee Majors are all great actors who may not be big stars (or big stars anymore), but have always made fun movies. <br /> <br /> Here they are all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department. In fact, most of the action also seems to be in high school, which may not be so bad if it wasn't so pretentious. <br /> <br /> These days, Ed Wood's name is too easy to claim. I think in this case that the comparison is justified. However, I suppose old Ed would have made a more entertaining Western than this.
