Ignore the extreme voices about "House of Wax", in no way is it either a "1" or a "10". I will try to help anyone who thinks about seeing the "House of Wax" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers need to do. There is only one thing safe with trailers, if the manufacturers cannot cling to interesting items to make trailers for a moment, it is quite certain that the film is a great sucking party. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it doesn't give you a lot of idea about the overall package. Here, a little research can be valuable. <br /> <br /> "House of Wax" stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose plays are closer to Kathy Ireland than to her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen) and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume , in his own debut. These are not good signs, but if you are like me, you ignore them and go to see the production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of "Ghost Ship". Once again, Walken's work is worth seeing so much that it appears that 90% of the film's $ 30 million budget went into production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she must take throughout the movie (finger cut off, lips glued closed, tied up and lots of wading around in different gooey stuff). By the way, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in "The Girl Next Door", about a big pork away from having a bigger weight problem. <br /> <br /> Which means they had a little left to pay the rest of the throw and the crew. And judging from what was on the screen, it could actually be true. It seems that everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay gap, the contributions of all those inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are less than zero. <br /> <br /> Inexperienced Steven Windows DP work was just as terrible as you would probably see and work in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert "Pearl Harbor" here), they manage to remove most of the value added from the production design group. Instead of sitting over and showing the sets, the film window shone these things with poor lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran complicated the problem with a crazy number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera and flurry cut are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production designs; not what is needed when the film's only strength is its expensive and detailed set. Chan Hayes made the manuscript and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the author, with the exception of the title and the use of wax figures, there is absolutely no similarity. A hidden grace is that the film does not take itself seriously as a horror movie and is mostly parody (insert "Van Helsing" here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even scary for anyone over the age of six. The audience was particularly upset when a particular high-profile hotel heir got his home face through a steel beam, although her former half-baked striptease was the only real scary thing in the movie. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert stabbed his finger through a grate and cut the bad guy. The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a waxing work that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, continuous twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets bathed). All this has to happen somewhere in rural Florida, although from the many hills it looks as if Paul Hogan's land (attention place scouts golf coast is not known for the rolling terrain). The play was apparently intended to make the connection (bad saying) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue about this was trimmed. As it is left, the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, wondering why it was not cut to reduce the boredom factor. What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in the middle of the production that they had the ingredients for a first-class horror classic - even with the existing cast. What stared in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a city wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern films are inherently naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a clear opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element in extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the city creates reality illusion from a distance, but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication close by. Of course, they would have had to find a visionary director and DP to bring the case successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.
