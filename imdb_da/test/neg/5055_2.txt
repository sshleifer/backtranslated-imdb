I heard this movie was bad ?? They warned me it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still saw it when it came on national television. Watching Kevin Williamson movies means torture! His scenarios are not fun, absolutely not scary and not least creative. Teaching Mrs. Tingle draws the same annoying atmosphere as her brainless series "Dawson's Creek" and it is probably also intended for the same audience. Before the credits just started, 5 people already wanted a hug and they said the terrible "I love you" sentence. It doesn't get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop / rock and the storylin is ultra-thin. Three students at the degree of graduation are caught cheating by the vicious teacher at school. Every high school has a teacher like that, you know ?? In order to save their skin, they try to convince Mrs Tingle that it was not their intention to cheat, but this attempt goes terribly wrong. The typical high school humor is totally lost on me, overdose of emotions is pathetic and the actor (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is abominable. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act ?? It's a fact proven by her role in "The Gift" ?? But she has to stop accepting frumpish girl roles. As said before, the only positive comments go to the brilliant casting of Helen Mirren as a shrew. It's like Kathleen Turner in `Serial Mom '! The role is perfect for you, and you can't imagine others playing her. Apart from that, this is unnecessarily teenage nonsense.
