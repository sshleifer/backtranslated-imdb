A good cast ... A good idea, but turns out to be flawless, as hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in court. So many good actors and they seem so bad! So why were they all attracted to this mess ... And yes it has its good points like lighting etc. But in the end I wondered about two things .... How could so many talents lead to such a bizarre mess? What is the accent that Nigel Hawthorne puts on? He is / was a great actor and so what is this accent about? It is impossible to identify? What did he try to do? Maybe it's his subtle indication as to say to us: "I've been involved in a turkey, so here's a sharp accent to go with it!"
