This film is only recommended for insomniacs: it will relieve them by putting them in bed. Five-year-olds can also enjoy it. But for everyone else (including fans of the genre), what a drilling! The "old" plot is reminiscent of "Return of The Dragon" and this movie is just as unfortunate, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse movie. So far this is the second (the offensive "comedy" "Bachelor Party" was the first movie I gave 1/10 to.
