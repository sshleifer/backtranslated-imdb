* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a travesty of a movie! Now he is in Italy and appreciates our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but comes back to the states for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even scored with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, this movie doesn't deserve to be spoken with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter because it's really quite, totally, completely BAD. <br /> <br /> I think the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's skull was opened and he was forced to eat some of his brain sprouts? WTF? So why HELLEN was all so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did history continue anywhere? I assume this is the "teen" chapter of the Hannibal series; horrible, stupid, gory for your sake and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, especially if you love any other of the Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
