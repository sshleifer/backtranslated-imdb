Bigfoot movies tend to be bad so I'm not inclined to watch them. But there were some good advertisements on The Sci-Fi Channel so I decided to watch. A climbing expedition heads into the Pacific Northwest to find a fallen aircraft carrying the expedition's daughter (played by Lance Hendrickson) and has brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence of the sasquatch. And it actually generates some excitement at first. The Sasquatchen is invisible, but sees the climber's body warmth (like the alien in "Predator") and I wondered when it should strike. The action is acceptable, just like the background music. The dense wooded location is well utilized. And when the creature is finally seen, costume is not bad, but nothing big. But as the film goes through, it becomes more and more annoying and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the money and advertising expedition (except Lance Hendrickson's character), so it's impossible to care about what's happening to them. And their behavior is getting more and more stupid. A man shoots the creature (not bad), then becomes full and sits alone in the dark. A female camper puts on a slender silk negligee before they creep into her sleeping bag, so you almost avoid being dragged into the forest by sasquatch without getting her hair and makeup up. Then, the survivors conclude that sasquatch is really after the DNA detection machine and will let them live if they leave behind ("a creature knows what threatens it"). Of course, the instinct does not apply to these actors, or they would not have appeared in this movie. And the end is so stupid you want to kick the TV screen. If it wasn't for the script, it would have been a decent horror movie.
