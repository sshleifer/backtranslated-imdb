WARNING: CAN INCLUDE SPOLES <br /> <br /> In the wake of the first "Jaws" movie, Ripples was still prominent in the 1980s and beyond. Movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and giant animals lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie, the sea, the deep space, the genetics). Though "Jaws" was a landmark in this particular realm of movie horror, few movies have been able to match the original influence. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (also Devil Fish or Red Ocean) is a devoted supporter of the original "Jaws" formula. After several effortless boats and sailors are brutally murdered by any sea creature, there is a first drive to discover the animal, so a lack of investigation without terrible results and a final effort to destroy it. Although the filmmakers tried to inject new life into the equation by adding elements of technology and business collapse, the result is nothing short of catastrophic. This movie falls under its own weight of horrible editing, crazy plays and cheap scares. <br /> <br /> The most disease-aware feature of "Devil Fish" is its cookie-cutter editing. From the start of the movie, when 3 different scenes are gathered, the viewer gets the feeling that the film lacks technical credibility. It seems that the editors cut the scenes around a set of musical scores instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music. In addition, each cut is a cut and it seems that the editors had never heard of the terms "fade", "wipe" or "dissolve". The effects of scenes can never settle down because they are cut shortly after a last line and a new scene begins. Stupid camera tricks abound as when two of the principal characters share a private moment on the beach, and a kind of time-lapse image of their action is composed over their bodies. <br /> <br /> The music is just as boring. The cupboard theme is a hopeless duplicate of the "Jaws" theme with a slight variation. Although I like to keep my reviews devoid of MST3K influence, Mike most appropriately described the bad score as "soft core porn music". If one fails to produce tensions in a movie that so heavily relies on it, it is a death blow for "Devil Fish". The plot is outdated, relationships are confusing, and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. The question remains that if genetics had reached such a level to create a great chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why couldn't a more practical application be administered to better humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this movie is the idea of ​​the monster, although its movie presence is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre. If "Jaws" had never been made, the film could be described as average because its object would be new and exciting, even if it was done ineffectively. Unfortunately, as a carbon copy of Spielberg's original thriller, it sits most comfortably on a garbage of cheese.
