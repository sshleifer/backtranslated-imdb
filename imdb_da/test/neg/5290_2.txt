Twenty years ago Dr. Chopper (yes he runs a helicopter and chops people up) when the police found dead bodies in his clinic. Since then, people have disappeared around Lake Tanoka (or something) and dead bodies / parts of bodies have been found everywhere. It turns out that Dr. Chopper needs body parts to stay alive and has taken them from strangers, like couple of lesbians and 5 sorority girls at their initiation (you get the picture) traveling through Lake Tanoka. When a bunch of teenagers decide to go camping, they are bound to collide with the doctor. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste some time, this is the right choice. Action varies from really poor to mediocre with the girls tripping and falling all the time without apparent reason. Every chance of showing skin is taken, but without actually showing anything at all. The same goes for the special effects that are pretty pathetic with every slash that is filmed at an angle so you can't see it, but there are many body parts in the film that are soaked in blood (probably to cover where sad they really see). The reason is pretty faulty and the dialogue pretty sad. Only the time I laughed was when Dr Chopper said, "Howdy!" when trying to be scary. Don't look at this if you're not a hack'n'slash freak. Even then I would recommend you to see something better.
