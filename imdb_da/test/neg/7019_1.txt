At first I really love Lucy. Her TV show makes me laugh. She was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived, right there along with Chaplin and Keaton. But her performance in this movie is disappointing. She was too old and the gaz filters on the lens make her look like a London fog refugee. She couldn't sing, and her voice was so froggy that she crept through every song. Her dance days were long in the past. Just because you are a Lucy fan, don't shine over this wrong, sad performance and sing it praise. I prefer to remember Lucy in his wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and to draw the curtain of charity over the horrible mess of a movie called "Mame".
