Why should they make such a terrible adjustment? The whole series "Complete Jane Austin" as part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. Characters are completely miscast and there is no chemistry on the screen. It all seems rather hasty. The 1999 publication based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece in relation to this. I really want to forget it. I am really happy, though, "Pride and Prejudice" will not be re-made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as main characters. If you skipped this "Mansfield Park" production, consider yourself lucky!
