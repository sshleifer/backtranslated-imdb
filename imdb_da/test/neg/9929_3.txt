I got halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just flat out boring and totally unrealistic. I can get past being unrealistic in many movies, but not when it should be a crime drama thing. The evidence gathering and interviewing processes were simply simple. I started relaying quickly to see how it ended. And then got bored and knocked it off and returned it. The protagonist Ellen Barkin played was not convincing at all. Peta Wilson acted very well in this movie, but her character was far out there and no one for her actors to play that made it work.
