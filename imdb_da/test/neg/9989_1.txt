It is a rare feeling to come across a movie, so embarrassing that you feel the urge to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked, copulating couples, it's just what you want to do. Add Peter O'Toole as the Syphilian Emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, holding your finger up in a male sacrifice's anus, and you begin to understand that Caligula is only interested in ill / outrageous abusers. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the life of the infamous Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a heavily disturbed person whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheaders, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Even though Caligula was totally unhealthy in real life and probably eventually succumbed to his bass instinct more often than not, the film is still indelible filth. Gender in the film is not used as an aspect of a multi-layered story - gender is the story. After a while, all nudity, hip and nipples become sweet because of pure repetition. The performance is completely rude, especially McDowell, who is cautious about the wind and gives a performance that is all wild-eyed posturing. O'Toole seems to treat the manuscript with the contempt it deserves (surely it is pure money?!). Smokers are abundant because additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during the post production, but truly there is not a single minute in Caligula that is worthy or well-deserved. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown into a porn movie again, so Caligula is in that sense a unique experience ... on the other hand, it is so monumentally terrible that maybe it is one-of-a-kind -a-kind 'a blessing in disguise.
