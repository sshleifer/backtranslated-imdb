As their entire career was a pale imitation of The Beatles, it is not surprising that shortly after the great failure of the Beatles "Magical Mystery Tour", the monks would follow up with their own incomplete and creative morass of a movie called "Head." Both movies are not so much a true story with a plot (although MMT tried to define a plot), as they are a hodge-podge of sketches and excerpts, tense with music and songs and excerpts. <br /> <br /> "Head" has no plot except for the pre-fab four trying to break free of the "box" they are in (ie the type of casting of "Monkees" and the surrounding commercialism) and yet always getting back in the box. Most sketches involve breaks in "fourth wall" and cross over to other seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts to show their other talents, the film is jumping around randomly - even to blame for the many directors. <br /> <br /> The movie, like the Magical Mystery Tour, is now apologized by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements." Phooey. As MMT, it is too many guys with access to too many drugs, which everyone tries to make something artistic and makes crap. As MMT, "Head" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a little more charm than MMT, and it's a little easier to sit through, but it's not ironic at all that just like everything else Monkees did, it was just an imitation of something the Beatles did first ... even when it comes to laying an egg.
