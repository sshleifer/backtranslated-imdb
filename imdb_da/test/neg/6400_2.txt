This takes place on Fire Island back in the 1970s. A couple of Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) throw a 4th of July party in their house. Unfortunately, their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests. The rest of the film chronicles the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay man, but I was back 8 when this was made. If this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s, I'm glad I wasn't around. From the astonishing opening credits that show that children are playing in the sand (???), this movie slowly goes into disaster. There is a guru (Robert Case) who speaks nonstop about nothing of any importance. I wanted to gag the guy halfway in his first LONG speech. There is the young child Danny who is there for his first time. There are lesbian couples (who do nothing - except a strip for no reason). There is the leather queen. Worst of all is the lonely man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We are introduced to him and his friend (whose name I have never gotten) when they get a flat tire. They scream and screech for 10 minutes and have no idea how to make an apartment. I know some people find it fun, but I found it offensive and pretty sad. The party itself is full of people you will never know. It's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing unpleasant people. With the only exception to Dudley, no one can act. <br /> <br /> This can be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was like in the 1970s ... but it's pretty boring to see. This only gets 2 for the frequent male nudity of some very fine bodies.
