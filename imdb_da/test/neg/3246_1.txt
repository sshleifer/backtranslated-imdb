Hi, this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The day I watched this movie, I had a high fever. But I still saw the movie with lots of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt like repentance. Because I wasted 3 hours for this silly movie. I could have taken rest rather than watching this movie. And I was really surprised at how actors such as Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab, etc. acted in this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a movie, why do they stay as directors? Why can't they sit at home and spend their time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all directors that it will be good for them if they request the audience, either by mail or media, newspapers, radios, etc. ... to send them a good story if They don't make it find a good story to make a movie. I ask again for all board members, please do not make such films.
