Let me get it out of the way before I destroy this movie: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as an instructor. While I disagree with the masses, he says he is the best instructor working in our time, I cannot deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Min-sik Choi's play was also the only thing that allowed me to take this movie seriously. . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is. <br /> <br /> Now, it's bad: The reason is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I never understand how critics can destroy a Hollywood blockbuster to be cliché, so hail movies like Oldboy, which is as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more. Whether Oldboy is flat out one of the most generic, unoriginal films ever perceived. * Spoilers * You are being held in prison, man seeking revenge, you find out he had sex with a family member, human life is over. * End spoilers * Simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from Greek player to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless films / books in between. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the great revelation happens, I laughed out loud. Does that mean I'm a desensitized freak without feelings like some reviews of this movie say about people like me? No. What it means exaggerated plots makes people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise showed it, and Oldboy proved it too. Why can't people think of something that really disturbs rather than just spitting out tried cliches masked with fancy camera work and classical music? It raises the issue of blood / gore. In short, it's not there. The director is too honest to even point the camera on the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we are watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I've heard Oldboy called the "most brutal movie at all times" and "the most disturbing movie ever", but when I looked at it, I couldn't see anything even distant gory or disturbing. All "gore" is off-screen, and even then, the violence level is not something you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why this even has an R-rating confuses me, much less "the most brutal movie all the time". Seriously, I've seen movies that just make Oldboy look cute at all levels when it comes to violence. The other big, sharp, cheesy bug is the biggest villain. Most of his screen time, he shows his naked butt to the public in comedic American Pie style, but I'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? When wearing clothes, his hair slips back as a bad Asian mix of the cheesiest James Bond villain mixed with something out of Austin Powers. He speaks like a brain-dead teen who regains an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that I laugh again. Seriously, Oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year. . . <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Oldboy is for those of you who drink fin wine, have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your life is at evening parties. It is for those people who are so stuck in their own ego, they forgot how they are original, and thus forgot how unoriginal and boring the "movies" (never "movies") they enjoy. <br /> <br /> The two people I can say are this: I like "movies" and also "movies". I like thought-provoking dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like pointless action movies that stretch me into a coma. But it is for me to like both "movies" and "movies", they must be original. They must be something I have not seen so many times, I lost count the number of times the plot has been used. When something is not original, it can be used. If it does exactly what everyone else does, it is forgettable and boring. Before you give Oldboy another perfect rating because it "touched" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie just as touching, but at the same time make the original you think more? I just want someone else than I would understand this. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgettable and cheesy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
