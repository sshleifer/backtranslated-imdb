How does a movie become a biblical epic? Just by quoting a few scriptures and using some names out of the Bible for your signs? The only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot about the 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheba were also used. Where did King Vidor get the rest of his story from? It probably wasn't from the Bible. It was complete & complete nonsense. To read about the government of Solomon as King of Israel, read 1 Kings 1-11 & 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even come across Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 & 2. The Queen of Sheba (who does not appear until King Solomon has been king for about 20 years or so, which by the way is long after Adonijah & Joab had been dead) can be found in 1 Kings 10 & 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things Solomon does is make an affinity with Pharoah by taking his daughter. Yes, King Solomon was involved in the worship of false gods, and therefore the kingdom was split after his death, and the temple was not destroyed by lightning. I also think that Solomon was too busy marrying and giving temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and turning to his 300 concubines to fight against Egypt, let alone a dead brother. As I said this movie was completely nonsense. If you don't use the story in the Bible then call it something else. This could just as easily have been called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
