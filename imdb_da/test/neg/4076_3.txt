If you're not a fan of the 80's and you have to be a particularly strong fan or one of the two leaders, there's nothing to recommend about this movie. <br /> <br /> The story, as others have said, is boring, almost a reflection of the basic notion of the characters and the idea of ​​making a little manic comedy. I saw it in about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a twist would occur, or it would somehow kick in gear, but no ... It's not unimaginable, it's just boring. It goes by. It runs past madly, lingering shots of feet at strange angles, bit of yelling madly, but I didn't get a real sense of energy or manic fun, it just came over as forced. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh at especially. A little gentle pleasure here or there, but no more. Don't be fooled by mentioning feminism by the way, all that means in this case is that almost all the main cast is female. If that's something, it's actually cloying ... Two female managers, fine, excellent, the drug dealer is woman, okay, their landlord is hostess, okay, their friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building, oh, female ... I wasn't looking for it, but after a while it felt like a deliberate decision to get the movie cast that way, and it felt a little forced and cloying again. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you're a fan of 80's fashion and culture, there's plenty to see and if you're a fan of Helen Slater, she's fun and fun to watch. There is also some screen time for Carol Kane, which is great but not enough ... Overall: 3/10. If you're a big fan of the 80s, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, you might be able to stretch it to a 5 because of them, although it's still a comedy that's not fun, preventing it significantly. If you're not a fan of these things, you might as well do it 0 because there's nothing else to enjoy here.
