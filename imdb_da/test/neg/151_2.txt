This movie just didn't do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies, but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when they cut off one's feet, it looks so false. The same goes for the other effects like tongue torture and intestinal sex. They could have spent a little extra money on the effects. <br /> <br /> With lots of sex (with pixelation as in any Japanese movie) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick things like this. While more bloody suited it to me with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These movies have girls who eat and play with every liquid coming out of your body, eating bugs and fish in rough roads and having sex with all kinds of nice animals, like amphibians, eels and ... A look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here, just sick and miserable sex scenes. Scarecrows must avoid this and are better at checking Guinea Pig2: Flowers of Meat and Blood or even August Underground Mordum. Although these are not good, at least they offer a frightening experience, and Niku Daruma fails entirely in that department.
