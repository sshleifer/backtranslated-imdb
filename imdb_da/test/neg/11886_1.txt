This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain top municipality as free men in the 17th century Brazil. The story is interesting and constructive. But this movie - like film - is horrible. <br /> <br /> The audio track is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. The battle scenes are fought for the sound of cheesy pop rhythms that are best left for disco or bad police. Probably the texts are folk tales about the slavery's heroism. The special effects are absurd. Instead of relying on the mystique of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they only make the movie look cheap. They are absolutely incredible, and I mean not only in a sense of verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> Life in the municipality of Palmares could not have been as portrayed in the film. For this community, as shown in the film, one-split kibbutz is a one-part Afro-pop festival. In addition, it is almost embarrassing to see the instructor playing on the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who will simply be happy. He portrays daily life as a series of dance parties, where the liberated slaves paint with bright colors and whirl around to the tribes of the 80's pop music. On the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful food, but the viewer hardly sees any work out. The king weighs against private property in a hackneyed and clichéd way. When a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months, the king says: "What comes from the earth belongs to all that the earth belongs to no one. If they need food, they are right to I am happy because I learned about this episode in history, but I am relieved that a movie with such low production values ​​and that about such worn stereotypes would probably not be made today.
