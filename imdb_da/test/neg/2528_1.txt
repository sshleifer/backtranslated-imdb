Man, are you serious? Have you read the book or watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's false. Mark Furhman has applied for a job since losing his job with LAPD. You remember him, right? He was the guy who lied to the booth and gave OJ Simpson the defense of a foothold they were looking for. Now he has written three books since then. I've read all three of them. No, I'm not a fan, they were given to me. But I want to tell you an equality in all three, distorting the seriousness of Mark Furhman's. He shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. In "Murder in Spokane," he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer as he had nothing to do with it. In all books, he takes great pleasure in running down local law enforcement efforts. Like his efforts were worn in the OJ trial. In this movie there are lots of slow motion shots of ladies at Furhman and lust for him. Many other shots have him in the center of attention when I am really sure the only thing people thought about was "hello, isn't it the racist who made OJ go?" This was an interesting story, but not a good movie about it.
