The first 4 episodes in season 6 are just throwing up, for predictable and the worst scenario I've seen. Will not and hopefully I will not buy it. Also seen in seasons back that episodes of space they did suck even more. All I want to say to the people who do this is: don't make the whole episode place because they suck. The point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before. Worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and frustrated to see the first 4 episodes in season 6 that I just had to write this. Only people who are brainwashed can see this shit. Seems that people who write the scenario are coming out of ideas for a long time. Think my 2-year-old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do.
