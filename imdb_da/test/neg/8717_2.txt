Certainly one of the cripples ever shows to be produced on these shores and that says something. Even many of the main players did not stick to the duration. The fact that it ran for eight years is a sad accusation of the average intelligence and cultural nous of the Aussie seer. It went around and around in circles with repeated gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God's sake. have they actually paid the authors of this show? I wonder if anyone controlled their qualifications. There were tired gags about rural and other rate farce situations, there were bad imitations of a thousand English and American sitcoms that had gone before. I think that is what I hate a lot about that it does not seem that anyone involved wanted to make it memorable, original or wise, but instead choose the lowest common denominator each time.
