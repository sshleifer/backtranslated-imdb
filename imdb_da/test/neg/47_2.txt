I caught this at the IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short film: heavy on style, a bit of substance and originality. Is it a surprise that one comes out movie stars an unusually attractive (and blonde to start) boy with 70s shag hair and for-cool-to-school clothes? Plus, this movie wallows in the late 1970s chic, which works for some (Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides" comes to mind) but not for this director. Another reviewer compared this to the work of Harmony Korine and I agree. Yet I do not see this as a positive thing (what has he done lately, anyway?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you see it late in the evening on cable, turn the channel and see something else instead.
