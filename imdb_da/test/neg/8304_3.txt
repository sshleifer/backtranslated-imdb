Wow. Just wow. Never before have I seen a horror movie where it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that someone wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then I happened to come across "Lady Frankenstein". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and makes it all the way up and down ... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie, you've either stumbled across it on Italian TV or you have the copied version of the 50 Chilling Classics Box that I have as number 24. And let's just say there's a reason why these movie is here. Because they are not very good. enough of it though on the film. It starts with Dr. Frankenstein tries to make the monster with his assistant, which is .... apparently not igor for any reason. His college student daughter (?) Turns out and tells how she just graduated with a medical degree, causing yes. There were so many female doctors then. So she says how she wants to help her father work and he says no. And then he makes the monster and it kills him. So she takes care of exactly 7 seconds and then a story with the assistant how it was a theft. The monster escapes and goes on a rampage. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can't believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the movie. He dies like ... 20 minutes in. and then his daughter over. which .... doesn't make a lot of sense, but sure. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is now raging .... is to make another monster! oh yes how i love her logic. so her new monster gets her body by killing someone and putting the brain in the assistant in it ... i know. just nod and go along with it. So the meetings meet and celebrate it. I love how the assistant asks "why don't we just kill the mob?" and she replies with "they would not know how to kill it!" And finally he kills it with an ax to his head. haha. Oh yes, no one else could have figured one out. So in the end the brain changed the new monster killing Lady Frankenstein. The end. <br /> <br /> This movie was just .... strange. it was serious as if someone wrote a self-locating fanfic. There is no other way to describe this movie. there were also some odd naked scenes. like this girl had naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the guy runs away. haha. nice guy. She struggles so little and dies from ..... to be honest, I really don't know what she died of. So what. It's Lady Frankenstein. It doesn't have to make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie had many of them "Why?" moments to the point I just gave up. Movies shouldn't, but for some reason I see it more than I probably should. <br /> <br /> So last word, it's not the worst movie I've seen on this package, but it's a bit boring and full of many gaps and random stuff. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein gets 3 Frankenstein porn scenes out of 10
