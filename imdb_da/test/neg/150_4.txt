Not as good as the "Guinea Pig" girls were inspired by ("Flowers of Meat and Blood" or "Devil's Experiment") and did not convey any true philosophy. This video feature, which has almost no length, adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censorship) to its inspiration. The special makeup effects that include belly grinding and lifting are pretty good if overgrazing. The amateur's sense of production is a distraction. It all looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is hard and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porn actress who ends up staring in a real snus movie. Just as she gets tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. In the film's hero scene, an actor cuts the woman's belly open in graphic close-up, leaps her member into it and continues to do her thing. I didn't find "Psycho - The Snuff Reels" shocking. On the contrary, I found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one-up "Guinea Pig" and its bloody ilk. Interestingly, this was distributed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.
