I agree with what so many others have said about the thorough and insulting nature of the film's study of racism. It is confusing to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by their pretentiousness. I will comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what is most annoying about this movie. Here we have a man who - unlike the film's underlying message that "we are all a small racist" - effectively rapes a woman in public, in vain humiliating her husband and deliberately going him to make a move as he well Know that will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this to pull the couple over without any legal cause, but because we, as they understand, are black and wealthy, and he is an evil little boy who is now the police and can therefore do whatever he wants. This behavior is not a small racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extremity of racism is maintained alongside another person's behavior - spying on his paranoid stereotypes about gang violence - to illustrate that everyone is a small racist. Later, we were washed a little over Dillon's bad old father and how black people drove him into the poor house. Should this be explained, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character supposed to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and incredible, ridiculously random act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted much the night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulating admiration for this movie makes me sad that our understanding of racism is superficial and our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and end it.
