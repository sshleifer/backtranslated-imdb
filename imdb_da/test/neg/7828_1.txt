Tired, distorted drink. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The story was a mess. The action forced. The kinematics lingered on the uninspired. Lazy and meaningless. Kim Gordon and her character had no reason to be there. Neither did anyone else. I couldn't have given two farts for any of the 'signs'. Their emotions jumped over and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroin. Empty and boring. Why should I write ten lines of text here to make my point? I think I summed it up in the first three words. But of course that is not enough. I think this is the last time I will forget to waste my time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw 'Clean' and thought it was also quite ineffective. Again I didn't care for the signs, whether they lived or died.
