Disclaimer: During my ventures in foreign cinema, I have been wanting a wide range of films spanning various genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy and romance to name a few. Thus, I have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of drama as well as the thoughtless popcorn fun of action movies. With a wide selection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films under my belt, I am convinced of my ability to recognize light points in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. <br /> Initially, this overstated swordplay epic shows the infamous "slideshow" sequence all the way through, which is no more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. You just have to show a number of close-ups of ugly faces, swords, legs and / or arms and then a dead body. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem is not only in its poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and inconsistent that the viewer has no idea what hell is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this movie is non-existent, as it depends on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of developing and displaying such items on the screen, which makes all characters are generic and colorless, giving the viewer no care about their actions. In fact, the story itself is an absolute disaster that introduces too many characters too quickly with too many plot units. Plot complexities in movies can be used very favorably (ie, a narrative of two sisters), but ashes of time becomes exploitable trash can when it does nothing more than envelope a very simple plot with no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film works like a series of smoke screens to cover its shortcomings. Horrible action choreography is covered by "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movements. Non-existent character development is covered by the characters obviously saying how they feel. And a thoughtless story is covered by the confusing viewer with convolution. As if this wasn't bad enough, this movie was extremely boring, apparently more than 150 minutes instead of the actual 95. <br /> Rating = A rare given 0/5 Stars.
