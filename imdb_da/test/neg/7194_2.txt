Do you ever have one of those sneezes that seem to build forever? You gasp and you fight, and you take the closest paper product in preparation for the world's largest hanky fan ... and then fizzles it. "Frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of the lost sneeze. Now I'm great on B-movies, and I always look the other way when a boom pops on the screen, or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but one really let me down. The coverage of the video is e.g. Roof line for the whole movie. Using parts from the murdered New York prostitutes, Dr. Franken's late fianc√©, only to make her run crazy in Manhattan as a kind of super-prostitute with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of construction, this seemed pretty funny ten minutes a little anti-climactic.
