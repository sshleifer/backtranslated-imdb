Poor Casper Van Dien, his career has gone a long way from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> In Meltdown, he is a policeman who is just becoming TV reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten, and her brother is a scientist trying to deal with an accelerated commentary on the way to Earth. But in the round comet industry, even a near miss causes some real problems, as the Earth's orbit goes out of kilter. From the earth's survival, we go to the survival of Van Dien and his immediate family. Actually, his daughter's boyfriend, Ryan McDonell, turns out to be of use, especially when he suspects a guy he knows as a curly policeman, the Van Dien group can cause much damage. My only question is why did they not have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to handle the unpleasant comet? <br /> <br /> Pass this one up people.
