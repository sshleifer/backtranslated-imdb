I almost laughed, as during the comment, the director said that this movie is original with a strong plot line. There is no ... repeat an original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. <br /> <br /> The Crows .... Hitchcock made it excellent back before CGI, and even with CGI, this movie lacks a successful attack scene. The creepy bad boy ... Grudten did it and did better. The psycho ... made in Cold Creek Manor at the latest, but it has been done to death. No sayings are calculated. Disconnected / rebellious teen who no one listens to ... about a dozen movies has used it right down to Beetlejuice. The unpleasant stuff from the basement ... can you say Amnityville Horror? Doors open forbidden ... What Lies Under did it with much more flair. Creepy farmhouse ... too many to mention. <br /> <br /> The background to metaphysics - which should have been the central focus, is lost when you find out what is happening, which by the way is pretty early. <br /> <br /> One thing (of many actually) they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked into the cheese in the basement so they really didn't have a body . <br /> <br /> Overall ... NOT CHILDREN
