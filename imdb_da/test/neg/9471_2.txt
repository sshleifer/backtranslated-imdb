This movie was determined on the boring side. The action was decent and the movie looks good, the soundtrack is destined for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. When I talked about the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a movie telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in the titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF by Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al" - except they Don't make it recognize it at all. Is there nothing a little hypocritical there? The scene in which the main child was in which he mimics a game show host was my favorite. 10 lines? I have to write ten lines about this movie to be included? What a ripoff, I don't think it's right to FORCE people to write more than they just wanted to get it included!
