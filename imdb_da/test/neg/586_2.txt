Very strange manuscript by Cameron Crowe (after the heels of his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has some inspiration and flails away in stupid gags. At least the "Fast Times" had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (kindly by a good director, Amy Heckerling and Crowe's undeniable sense of catching letters - perfect teen-talk); here is Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) the goof-off that makes life hell to straight arrow Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to think he's funny. Jenny Wright has some great moments as a mall employee, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a head-screaming sub-plot of a teenager who appears to be horrified by a shell-shocked ex-soldier. Queasy, confused nonsense given a shining brilliance and a soundtrack filled with pop-rock tunes, but characters one hopes to avoid. Supporting players Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in stupid roles. * from ****
