This is a good example of what happened at Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle left. Here's the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness, and he knew that he was 18 when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he seems to be from Mexico. He grew up in the US as well. <br /> <br /> I could possibly forgive all that shit, but ... He has been caught stealing other people's material. Joe Rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. The Stereotype Olympics was an idea, he ripped a couple of DJs from Miami. He's stolen jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole George Lopez's material in his own HBO special (13 minutes). He thinks what he's doing is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have cracked on race for years before this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This show will collide and burn. The word Beaner cannot last so long before it gets old. He hasn't done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to hear a joke? A beaner jumps a fence !! It's fun for 3 seasons!" Does not. <br /> <br /> Awful.
