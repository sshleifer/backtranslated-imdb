Although I could sum up this pathetic episode of the Night Gallery in two words, these two words are "manure", I am obliged to write at least ten lines. This is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather a creepy attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. The priest of giant rodents who are in the moon, a lifeless orb, is quite ridiculous, as is the construction of a large mousetrap. I suppose we also have to assume that the moon is made of green cheese, and so survive these absurd creatures. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to replace the other two episodes that were first sent on that date. All in all, a waste of movies, actors and air time.
