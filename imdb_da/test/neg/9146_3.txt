A tedious effort by the non-yet amazing instructor Budd Boetticher and the beautiful but unmixed actress Nina Foch, is this film that one of the other reviewers notes is a particular form of B movie. It's just not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine are wasted. <br /> <br /> Ground plan - Nina, a nurse on holiday from war, because of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing guy at the resort where she breathes her nerves and realizes that he is in the dream, even if she has never met him before. Meanwhile, our dashing guy turns out to be a spy and is about to go on an extra secret, hush-hush mission that must not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course there are Nazis. And plot holes. And wise people who act in a way are likely to make them completely unnecessary scrapers so that the maturity can be spun over an hour. In the end, the film becomes a competition between which group of spies can act more stupid. If the FBI and OSS had acted like this crew member, we would have lost the war in '42. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is pretty flat shot (despite the best efforts of the train) and the actor - as it seems to be in many of Columbia B.'s TCM has been lately - is curiously unmoved. It is less stylized than what you can find from a similar budgeted Warner Bros movie, but also less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Of course, Boettiger's strength is a pretty actual style that allows the strong stories to act in his Randolph Scott Westerns to come to the fore. Perhaps the problem here is that such a style will not work when the script is miserable and the actors are tired of their five films a year.
