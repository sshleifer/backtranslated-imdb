I really like the Salman Kahn, so I was really disappointed when I watched this movie. It didn't have much of a plot and what they had was not so appealing. However, Salman looks good in the film so young and refreshed, but was well worth the price of this DVD. The music wasn't bad, it was pretty weird. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long, but it was a very short movie for an Indian movie. The American actress who played in the movie is from the TV hit series Heroes, Ali Larter. Her plays had a lot to be desired. But she looked good in the Indian dresses she was wearing. The whole movie didn't have much to be desired, and I hope Salman does much better on his next movie. Thank you.
