Ali G was fun first. His interviews were fresh and original. The idea of ​​a mock gangster wearing OTT clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing first. <br /> <br /> But this movie is just a rehash of old jokes, humor was mostly childish and was about the male sex organ most of the time. The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance, but their talents were wasted as they played stupid 2-d characters. It is not "terrible" but is not fun at all for the other. One could say that the film was Ali G's last bastion of comedy. Then he ran out of steam.
