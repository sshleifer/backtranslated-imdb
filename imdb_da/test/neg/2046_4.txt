What is really horrifying about this is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something intelligent and sexy. Instead, they probably made the dumbest horror picture of the year! <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a bunch of art snob friends in a gallery. This rough European weirdo goes up and starts talking pretentious fertility to the protagonist who sounds like he just went out of an episode of Dark Shadows. He gives her her something to smoke (yes, a freakin stick), which she eagerly agrees with! He chooses some red crap and puts it in a spoon for her to freebase! If it ever happens to you in real life, don't! <br /> <br /> She's transported to some weird wannabe Jean Rollin netherworld, who was going to be sexy, but that's not where there's something like a rotten creature from the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon, she turns all her artistic sleazeball friends into her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue, they can't leave it alone. At one point she even ends up with the rat creature! After the final fight and the stupid woman has evaporated or anything, the so-called hero alone is back to pack his copy of Michael Moore's Dude Where's My Country and cannot resist smoking that once stops trying to save his moron lady friend. What a dope. <br /> <br /> Pricing four stars for pure accidental humor.
