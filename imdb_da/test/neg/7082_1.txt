I'm not from America, I usually see this show on the AXN channel, I don't know why this respected channel air sucks program in prime time slot. Creating Hollywood's Bank of Money Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he spends a lot of money on the small screen. In each episode, a group of people with two team members travel from country to country for a large sum of money; where the camera crews shoot their travels. I don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea to the show. It has nothing to take care of, in all episodes we see people running like beggars, sometimes shouting, crying, beeping, jerking camera work. It is harmful to both eyes and ears. The most obnoxious part of the race is the viewers finally knowing that each of the team members cannot enjoy their race / travel experience. While adding the ratings, the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in a show-sucking American reality show. It is nothing to look for, better switch to other channels. <Br /> <br /> The Amazing Race = The Disgusting Show.
