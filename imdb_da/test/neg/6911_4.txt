There seems to be quite a few genres of cheap, tired old sex "comedies" out there that say the same old stuff about middle-class couples. Kind of friends, but with more soft porn and no white. This movie is no exception - it had situations so I knew I died from deja vu. People were sitting on sofas, scattered clich√©s about sex and relationships? Check. Monogamy against cheating with a woman / man who would never see twice in reality with another woman / man? Check. PORN BADDIES !!!! 111? Check. Any guy / girl in it that is the only reason you see this nonsense? Check. The lesson looks like - when in doubt, make a tired old sex "comedy" about people who don't care about making a statement that everyone has already heard three thousand times before. It gets your movie made. It will even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad gem!
