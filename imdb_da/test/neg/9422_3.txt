Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android designed and trained for the military. When an error is detected, he is issued to be de-programmed. Instead of meeting death, he chooses to flee into Central America's jungle, where he takes refuge in a village. The military shocks him in there, leading to a big action party. Mario Van Peebles makes a decent performance for android. His movements and movements look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned to make a good act of action. And it works out; The action scenes are not that spectacular, but they are not too bad either. The action from the other characters is pretty bad, but I didn't expect anything too good. The special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent as an action girl but very forgettable. It lacks the fabric most films have. But if you just want to pass a few hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.
