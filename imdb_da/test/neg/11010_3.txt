I had heard this Japanese flick is edgy, creatively interesting, a "cool new thang" on the Asian filmmaking scene ... maybe even something as innovative as Hideo Nakata's "Ringu" or Chan-wook Parks "Oldboy", especially the latter. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disappointment, instead, I found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically (though not in the way a film aficionado appreciates), the clich√© ride, even sadly stupid instead of fun --- on the whole a very bad knock from the "Pulp Fiction" style. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking for 30 minutes when I was going to be more than it is.
