What can I say? This was hands down the worst movie I have ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are indeed awful). The actor was amateurish, the sets were dull, and the camera was foamy and sophomoric. This whole movie seemed like a college final project. I had to convince myself that it was done by a teenager to make it seem a little good. The most disturbing factor in "movie" is that it is not at all movie - it's shot on video. It was extremely distracting. On top of all, the dialogue is simply disastrous, and the baseline is so basic that it makes my eyes water. Not to mention they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. If there was such a thing as zero stars, this movie would get it. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it is.
