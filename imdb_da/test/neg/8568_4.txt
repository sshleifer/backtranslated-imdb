I'm a big horror fan, especially Spanish horror. This film had so many opportunities to be good. It's a great idea, a vigilant ghost, as most of what has come out of Jaume Balangueró's mind. Both visual and sound effects were also quite good. But everything was ashamed of bad direction, horrible casting and a painfully bad (exposure, exhibition!) Script. Too bad. Maybe Balangueró should write and address a remake ... Besides, I don't really understand why this had to be spoken in English by actors who can't really speak English (and when they do, they make it so bad it does their performances even more fake). If you look at contemporary Spanish horror films like El Orfanato or Rec, the show is in line with this kind of stylish ghost story - and it is realistic to be credible as one as ourselves as real people, because that is the only way horror gets it Goal. Unfortunately everything in La Monja managed.
