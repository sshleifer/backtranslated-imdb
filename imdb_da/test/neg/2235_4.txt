First, he produced this movie. It has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed. The open credits tell us that it was admitted to Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey was a delight in the universal fairy tales of the 1940s. He was also great in a movie I saw maybe ten years ago, but never heard of the page: "The Amazing Mr. X." Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as an exciting and scary movie. <br /> <br /> This is pretty wood, unfortunately. The reason is not easy to follow. When I got it on my hands, I was disappointed anyway. Francis Lederer looks good as a concert pianist. He was a very good leader ten or 15 years earlier. He was never really caught as a big star, even though he should have. <br /> <br /> This isn't terrible, but it's pretty hard to walk.
