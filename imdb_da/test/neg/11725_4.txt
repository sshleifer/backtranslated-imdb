One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this television movie, it would reflect some of the tastes and manners of the upper-class couple - Wallis Simpson and Prince of Wales - instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance. It is also not helped by JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS giving stiff, rather unpleasant to see performances where events are moving too slowly to keep the attention. /> <br /> It's hard to understand why a star in OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber would want to play Aunt Bessie, who supports the role, as the role is so colorless that she hardly falls out of sight. At this stage in his career, Olivia was in so many "noble" roles that require a royal presence but nothing more. A trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made TV movie era.
