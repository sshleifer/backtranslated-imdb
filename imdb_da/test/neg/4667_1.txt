<br /> <br /> I used to like some of the 80's Hollywood action blockbusters. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the action movie in the 90s has fallen to new depths. The worst of these, I think, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is shamelessly constructed and pulls out the worst clich√©s as it seeks to excite the viewers. The melodrama is so cringingly saccharin and awful that you can't actually wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent moves directed by such gentlemen as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately decided to jump on the commercial wagon. This film symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetics with great special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. It's the norm these days, and I'm starting to wonder if there's a role in Hollywood for scriptwriters. It seems like they are just using hacks and committees to write the simple scripts. The rest they go to the technology. There is not a single piece of great, hearty human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie, and it involves Liv Tyler's father who doesn't even look in the movie. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith gives a theme song to the movie - a ballad that really hovering and at least dragging on the heartbeat slightly when the final credit comes up. <br /> <br /> I cry for Western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for superficiality, dullness and a fall in human intellect. I would even prefer to see the eighth Friday the 13th.
