I agree with another viewer who wrote that this film is reminiscent of the sinister Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniel's comedy, "Something Wild," where a rather eccentric freedom is associated with a conservative and very orderly young man and the two constitute as a couple and basically her personality has an effect on him. He loses and learns to enjoy their short-lived tryst. This is exactly what is happening here, except inserting practical store letters eccentrically, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) into Melanie Griffith's role and super-safe teenagers, Lincoln (the name is not by chance, played by Devon Gummersall) in Jeff's part. This movie even shares the same twist and abrupt change of genre, with the creepy, violent girlfriend suddenly showing up at the end, and things ending very badly. Only here, instead of Ray Liotta playing a throwback to the 1950s movie goons, is Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage child who is in her own little world. He has some kind of fascination with death after his brother's suicide, and his parents have also interrupted and behaved quite strangely. (The mother is convinced that Christmas is coming soon, even though it's August). So on an evening with the "guys" (one of whom is played by Jason Hervey by Wonder Years) trying to buy them beer, he runs into Alex who decides to kidnap him and his friend's car (with his permission of course) and they take Next to mini-adventures across the deserts on the west coast, robust Robin Hood stores deprive fashion and of course indulging in routine self-discovery, each asking more about the lives of others. But Alex has left a partner in his theft trading and he doesn't go away easily. Although we are not consistently reminded of him or something like in repeated flashback or cut to his point of view. At least, much was done wisely. <br /> <br /> "Making me a favor" (aka Trading Favorits), is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal abuse and self-discovery, which is a bit for the first half of the movie, but delivers a little to late when Alex and Lincoln arrive at her home in the middle of the sky. As the filmmakers give you enough stimulation, the film is unfortunately almost over. I would recommend that if this is the kind of story you are in the mood for and despite the fact that Rosanna Arquette always gives a good performance (even in a poorly written movie), I still recommend catching this in its best form : "Something wild."
