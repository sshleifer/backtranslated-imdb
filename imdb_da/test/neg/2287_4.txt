This is more than just an adaptation of Bond: it's a pure rip off! With mediocre character sketches that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie. An older (chipped) Connery tries to revive his past 12 years later. The result is a humorous, sticky version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore some day!
