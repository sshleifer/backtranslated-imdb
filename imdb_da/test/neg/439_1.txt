Well, what can you say about a "horror comedy" that does not contain horror or comedy? There are no signs in the movie, but too many plot lines - all underdeveloped and most redundant. <br /> <br /> The computer-generated creatures look bad, just like the Disney versions of exaggerated tails rats. The wandering dead are the biggest rip-off except for the title they must look like the dead in Landi's movie, but are far removed. They just look like the bad actors with plastic and the bull's blood added. Two plot lines really showed some promise (love story and "company history"), but failed as much as the director, authors, SFX department, production and actors.
