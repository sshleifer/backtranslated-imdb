I can't remember too much about this movie, except that there was a clear free destruction of luminaires (lamps). Almost all combat situations included the unnecessary and unintentional destruction of useful light fixtures, though equipped with cheesy, 70-inch cylindrical shades to hold on to the timing of history. On one occasion, raucous lamp destruction takes place in a home game scene between the brothers in both their living room and dining room with fixtures in both rooms taken out. Nevertheless, the most malicious destruction moments later occur in a bookie office and include, but are not limited to, the cover of a luminaire with a ceramic horse head base, which consequently dissolves and the severe denting of a cylindrical shadow as a guy falls back into it. under another fisticuffs fight. Later, this lamp is also overturned when the guy is shot, causing further damage to the plastic-coated shade. <br /> <br /> While this movie encourages a particularly wasteful stance on lamps, one should keep in mind that lamps, regardless of their cheap construction or gauche, top-heavy appearance, are still valuable to the lighting they provide. But if you ever feel the need to smash a lamp, I would highly recommend this movie.
