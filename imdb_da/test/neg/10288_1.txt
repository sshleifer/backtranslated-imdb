After a very scary, raw opening that gives you the creepy "chainsaw mass" error, everything goes. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI officers start jabbing, you know they're the right killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "fool-ya" movies can find out. <br /> <br /> This movie is one thing in mind: portraying brutal murders. Why doesn't the little girl get tortured and murdered? Will it be next for us movie-goers? Torture and abuse of children? What's wrong with you people? Lynch really has a disgusting, ugly mind.
