Lethal Panther 2 is a dull early 90s martial arts action that sees an innocent policeman down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A pretty cheap look with virtually no artistic profit depends on this film of the quality and quantity of its action. But while there is no shortage of fist cakes, gunfights and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless fighting desperately lacks originality or excitement, with poor editing and everyday direction, making this movie a real task to sit through. The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is completely wasted, with its natural athletic ability overshadowed by some uncomfortably bad wires. The ballistic action scenes are an unimpressive blend of 'slow-motion' fly-through-the-air-while-shooting 'heroics, crazy vehicle stunts and endless evil guys that get shot. <br /> <br /> With so many better examples of the genre "girls and weapons" now available on DVD, I suggest you leave this well alone (unless you, like you, will endure virtually anything old rubbish to be a completist).
