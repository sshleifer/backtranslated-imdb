My mother wouldn't let me see this movie when I was in grade 2 because she said it was too violent. Well years later, and the only reason I remember this movie, is because of my mother I stopped and saw it at PBS. Well, perhaps after all this year, the build-up will lead to the great disapointment of this movie, but I found it paralyzed. It didn't live well, and it made the acting head, huge incredible gaps in the script, but there are a few cool scenes like car chases and a big pistol fight. I won't stop this movie again.
