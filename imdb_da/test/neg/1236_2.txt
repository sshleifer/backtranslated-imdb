Agustus and Call really did nothing? Why are they altogether, they did nothing else, then came to places after the evil guys where dead. What was the purpose of this show? I was very very disappointed. I expected more action, more history and seeing the birth of Heros and Great Deeds. Instead, I saw very little, it seemed like Agustus and Call where just the side story is for the great Indian boss. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure the story is just as close. They did very little to show why Texans and Comanche fought each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part about this movie was Zhan, who played Gus very well and is a great actor. A lot of good story that could have been wasted. It was sad, and I wish I hadn't seen it.
