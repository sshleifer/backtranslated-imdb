This story had the potential for a good movie. The difficult choice of love versus money and the fear and regret of making the wrong. But the movie was destroyed by the terrible miscasting of Robert Redford as the villain offering $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. As Redford has to pay for it. Redford's boyish good looks and all American charm can't cut it as an unlikeable, threatening, boor. Redford's actors are insufficient to make his character threatening. I can see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK the lady says, but you have to give me time to raise the money. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect as a sleazeball.
