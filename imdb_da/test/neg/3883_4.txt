I saw this with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, all of whom are great at their comedy, I really hoped for a laughing rebellion. Unfortunately, that's not what I have at all ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this movie has really made me laugh. There were times when I chuckled on one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was badly tried comedy, and somehow a bit of a Hera Pheri wannabe. <br /> <br /> Out of the three main feeds, I think Paresh Rawal's role was the most powerful. It was not the greatest role, but it certainly stood out over Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were okay I guess. Nothing special, just mediocre. Although Govinda stole the spotlight from Akshay in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this movie, and both were pretty bad. Lara's role hasn't moved me, or make me laugh, and Tanushree Dutta's character came right on my nerves! The music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen" which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" is also worth hearing. <br /> <br /> You will either like it or you will not. And judging by the bad comedy and lack of direction, I don't think you want to.
