If possible, I would have given this apologetic excuse for a movie, a zero star. It was by far the worse I have ever seen. It was as if it were a home video that some bored highschoolers decided to do as a joke. "Acting" was horrific. The "actors" did not even respond to the fact that they were murdered. Honestly, I bought this movie by mistake. The Spanish title said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought hmm might be ok. Wrong. It was honestly the worst ever. I didn't get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie. I skipped chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen. <br /> <br /> The cameramen were also horrible. It was like a home video. I would never recommend anyone to see this. Horrible horrible moronic movie.
