You know when you get older, you somehow think of the movies you didn't like when you were younger, perhaps because of your youth and inexperience. Cases when I saw The Godfather 14 years old, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and began to appreciate big movies. <br /> <br /> So I rented Dirty Dancing with my boyfriend last night at her request when she loved it for 14 years and I hated it at the same age. But I hoped because I was young and stupid at the age of 14, maybe it would be a new experience for me. So I sat down with her to see, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after seeing Dirty Dancing, I feel a violation. I want someone to reach my soul and rob me in 2 hours of my life from seeing this cheese party. First, Patrick Swayze plays a 20-year-old, but he seems to be 35. And the film's premise is that he seduces some underage teenagers and waits for her with his dance movements. Really scary. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is the clich√© plot where the "wrong side of the tracks" guy and the "rich smart girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is driven by the fact that the "rich girl" cannot dance a candy so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the great end of the holiday show or something. <br /> <br /> But you guessed it: The frown father goes in fast and forbids the two to see each other, and the film progresses to secret meetings with dance lessons and love to do. All of this culminates in the final scene, where the entire resort gathers around the two young lovers, while the once-antagonistic father accepts the 35-year-old dancer as his new-born teens daughter. Even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie when she admitted that it was not something she remembered. I didn't push her, but I smiled a little and put Godfather part II in the DVD player.
