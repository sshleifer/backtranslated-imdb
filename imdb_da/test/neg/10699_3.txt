For the most part, I considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes made me write one. You see, we also learn (SPOILERS ... if they can be called) that the devil's envoy has no chance to properly prepare the world's domination of his master because he is not skilled in martial arts! "Prosatanos" has been in a hole for centuries waiting for "human greed" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one fight against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
