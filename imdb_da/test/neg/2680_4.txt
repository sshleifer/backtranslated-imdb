All the ambiguity of Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series of chronic habits of assault on continuity and pulling relatives out of nothing. This post introduces the pot angle that he is not only a psycho-killer, but is actually run by runes that appear as a constellation every Halloween, and a cult uses him for ... erm, yes, this movie is far from coherent and I lost the plot after a while. The movie bleeds credibility so violently it doesn't have a drop left at the end. Why does Michael put a victim's clothes in a washing machine? Why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall? Do you get electrolyte really get your head to explode? Etc. It is left to Donald Pleasence in his penultimate film role to produce some wonderful little moments from the frightening dialogue he has given.
