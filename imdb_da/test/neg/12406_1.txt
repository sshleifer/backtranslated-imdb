Wong's direction is perhaps always the worst in movie history I've ever seen. This movie makes my 2000 highest movie, Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Soloman resembling an Oscar winner. The shortcomings of this film are without explanation. The biggest is the lack of depth. Each scene does not fully evolve as if the editing room does not know how to do their jobs properly. It is a shame that with such an all-star cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be ruined by this lack of vision. I am so disgusted and hope that some good instructors like John Woo or Ang Lee decide to reuse this movie and do justice. I'm not even sure if I can judge 0/10 ??
