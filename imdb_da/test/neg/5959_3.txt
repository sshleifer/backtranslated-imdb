OK, so I recently collected many vipco and hardcore titles on DVD, and I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing. A recent movie compared to other titles in the Hardgore catalog was a direct release to DVD. I have always been interested in the myth of el chokeberry ever since I saw a documentary about it as a teenager. But this movie is a horribly devastated shot on tacky dv story and acting is awful, it took me three go to see this movie all the way through. While the cheap 80s and 90s horror films are good because of their cheap budgets and comedies, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Check out some other titles in the hardgore series first, for example, boneyard is older, but much much better.
