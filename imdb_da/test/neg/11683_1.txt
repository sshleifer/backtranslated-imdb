OK, this movie was not good at all. Video games are not what I would boast if I was over 15 years old. Cool playing games, but writing a comment about video game players likes this movie, because that's what it's strange. Just play a video game, don't make a sorry story of being caught in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I will not lose my girlfriend in it. Fat is the worst ever? Ok, fat has a very well thought out story along with being a musical. Even if you don't like musicals, someone would say that fat is good. My brother plays video games all the time, and he watched 30 minutes and went because it was so terrible. I'm sleeping.
