Midnight Hour AKA: Tell Me No Lies (found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One of them is Merritt as a movie, complete with a plot (no holes), good story and credible conclusion, and the other is of the skin flick it tries to be. This is certainly no more than a B-Movie skin flick whose sole purpose is to show each girl in the movie in an excessively long sex scene at least once. <br /> <br /> If you try to judge this as a regular movie, then this is the bottom of the line drift. Great plot holes ruin what the story it has gone for it. For example, if an employee is killed, will you call the police or go home and beat the whirlpool? Judging this movie of it's skin content, it can be seen ... barely. The girls are mostly all beautiful, but clearly improved. However, the sex scenes were all long and overdone, and that only made redeeming quality a bit boring. <br /> <br /> If she wanted to, Amber Smith could be a decent actress. She was not as horrible as you could imagine or maybe beside the rest of the cast, she seemed much better than she was. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played Detective Arraya, shouldn't even see a movie, much less acting in one. She looked good so we know why she was there. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend it to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good skin flip, there is much better out there. I rate this 4 out of 10
