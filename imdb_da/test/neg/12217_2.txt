Asmali Konak is undoubtedly one of the best TV shows coming out of Turkey. With its unique film and visual approach to film recordings, the series has a broad following base, where rating records are continuously broken. Personally, I do not agree that singers become actors (therefore Ozcan Deniz - the main actor), but I think the characters speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Seeing the movie, it was disgusting to see how much anyone can destroy such a plotline. This year, this movie was able to monitor all descent stories that existed within the series. Not only that, the cultural flaws were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving family members dancing (Greek style) and breaking records that are not found anywhere in Turkish culture. Some argue for the film should be taken as a standalone movie, not as a continuation of the TV series, but this theory has a big fall, the way the film was marketed was that it will pick up where the series ended and will finish series once and for all. So with that remark in mind I and everyone I know would have asked for reimbursement and accepted to stand outside the theater to warn other victims.
