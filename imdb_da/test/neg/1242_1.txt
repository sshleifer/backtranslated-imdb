Maybe I'm alone here, but it's a crap show. I'm sorry, but I was enticed when I found out Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I had no idea from this show until months later, and has honestly lost her appeal), but I gave the show a pretty shot. Spike is trying to make himself into something he is not, that is, he is trying to be human. Fox did not even interfere with hiding the strings as they took him out of the box he came in. His sketches are trying hard, he himself is not fun, and the authors are struggling to write material to a non-talent host. There is too much good TV out there to waste your time with this show and Fox ..... Fox had some good times but you have to get your f $% * ing together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another "Me-too" network.
