Just looked at UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read it right, Orson Welles! Years before he became known for the radio's "World of War" and his feature debut Citizen Kane, Welles was a 19-year-old who just found his mouse. In addition to Vance and Welles, another player here was a Virginia Nicholson who would become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman sitting on something sticking back and forth with an African-American waiter (Paul Edgerton in blackface). During this time, a man (Welles) continues past her (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating). I would not reveal more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they constantly jumped. That's not to say that this was good, but it was fascinating to see even with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added in the 2005 print I saw. Worth looking for Welles enthusiasts and everyone with a taste of avant-garde.
