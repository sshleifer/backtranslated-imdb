You would hardly know that a year later, MGM put Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE, which sounds with MGM's technical know-how. How far they came in a year. CHENEY is a very stagey early talkie. The camera hardly moves. Shearer is her usual charming self, and Rathbone is well into a romantic leading role. They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source, which softens against a naturally floating dramatic scene, but the game is a solid and fun war horse so you can enjoy yourself if you don't have expectations. Oh, by the way, the plot involves a ring of top class jewel thieves that infiltrate into the community to swap their victims. There are some clever phrases in the manuscript, and true love conquers all. An Oscar nom for Best Screenplay Adaptation.
