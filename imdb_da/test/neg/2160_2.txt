Back in the cold and scary early 90s, a show called "Family Matters" was aired and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts at sarcastic comments into it, and you had yourself a nice little steal-wrong, parent-right-right show. So it worked fine, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: Make the same show again. <br /> <br /> Here's the difference, though: "Family Matters" had Urkel. "Step by Step" has the guy from the "Kickboxer" sequences that no one saw. He says things like "Dudette" and "Dane-Meister", and somehow the audience doesn't have to hate him. I mean seriously, "dudette"? How can you even get it across your lips? The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole Winslow pile combined with some more one-or-zero-dimensional characters like the stupid guy (JT. Well, Eddie), the smart girl (Laura) and a beautiful girl who spends his days looks pretty (in theory). The character development was just awful in this show. Grover and Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everyone milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth earning. <br /> <br /> Driven by a massive laugh-and-cheer band, stolen from some fun, this show proved to be a huge 7-year-old who humiliated the competition. Though you should be aware that this is the time when the family team was pretty much all big hits, everyone just ignored their crappyness because it was the 90s, a more crappy show didn't hurt.
