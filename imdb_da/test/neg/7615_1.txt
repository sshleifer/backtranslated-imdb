I am and have been a serious collector of Christmas related movies, TV shows, holiday specialties, etc. For over 25 years. Be aware of my warning and do not be misled by sterling reviews & media hype about this movie. This is not a Muppett movie, as we have become acquainted with them and it is certainly not for children. The fact that this was produced for a large television network is / was no surprise given their level of operation at this time. What is hard for me to believe is that the Jim Henson organization bent so low to get involved in this travesty of Christmas. I wish there had been reviews for me to read that would warn me before I wasted my hard earned money on this piece of trash.
