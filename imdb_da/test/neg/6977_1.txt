Sitting in a large wing chair with a large book in his lap, the only Bela Lugosi looks into the camera and in a terrible vocal delivery it sounds like he is mocking a reading of Shakespeare, and it is just that you constantly groping things that is unknown, accounts for the endless times, produces many scary things, (snicker), sensational? because they work new (Lugos eyes are now bulging with raised eyebrows and buzzers, he continues) most are not new, signs eternity "(cue visual of lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder, which then continues to rumble in an astounding 86 seconds). <br /> <br /> And then what is, without doubt, the worst movie ever Made in semi-docudrama style with an invisible narrator explaining the plot ... as it is ... the story is about the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr., thus crossing the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead, it mainly consists of a random assortment of vignettes that can ... or maybe not ... relate to the Glen or to the cross-dressing motif. A long sequence consists of some unknown woman who winds herself on a sofa, followed by a man who whips a woman into what we would now call S & M. <br /> <br /> Odd moments appear Bela without any apparent reason, and chatter more inane dialogue, like: "When he is wrong because he does it right and when he is right because he is doing wrong, you pull the string and dance to it." Huh? About twenty percent of the film's images consist of stock footage, accompanied by a VO, which relates to the story motif, but not to visuals. Therefore, we see stock footage of: busy city streets, motorway traffic, a thunderous bunch of buffalo and a playground full of children. But it gets worse. In a film about cross-dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel and 84 consecutive seconds of World War II combat scenes. Even the simplest objects are botched. In a scene we see a newspaper headline that reads "Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl". Under the heading that is clearly glued or inserted, the article deals with ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman spreads: "fly why it's against the will of the creators" in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium. <br /> <br /> Apart from the performance of Lyle Talbot, the play is uniformly horrible. Production design is inexpensive appearance and slack; (but you must love the sticky wallpaper). Editing is sloppy. Most of the background music is only suitable for 1950s style lifts. B&W cinematography has too much contrast. And the costumes look like something that came from a store. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Citizen Kane" as a comparison. I just don't know how to make a movie worse than Ed Woods "Glen Or Glenda". But fortunately it has Bela Lugosi in it. Every time he opened his mouth and looked into the camera with the big, wavy eyes, I fell on the floor and laughed.
