Isn't it strange how crap movies always tend to be a little better when you start seeing them with an attitude like, "Boy, this will suck harder than few things have ever sucked before"? It is virtually impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high ?? or even externally positive - expectations, such as "House of the Dead 2" is a successor to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolutely worst genre disasters that will ever be released. The original subscription of the original proved to be a great advantage for Michael Hurst, as it was very easy to exceed the quality level of his predecessor. And just as embarrassing it must be for Uwe Boll, huh? Do you have to recognize that a straight-to-video sequel without star force or advertising campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation? If anyone still doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not a good horror movie at all, but yes: it is definitely better than the first and even worth renting if you are looking for an unpleasant splatter movie with lots of gory butchering, sleaze and silly humor. There is no real connection with the events of the first movie (another benefit), and this part two opens up as a typical rancid sex comedy set on a university campus. The male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house, inhabited exclusively by blonde coeds with huge boobs, but the party is interrupted when an insane professor (Sid Haig!) Who drives his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie. This is the beginning of a rapidly spreading and deadly epidemic, but no worries, as the government is prepared and sends its best scientists and soldiers to campus to search for survivors and to return blood samples to an antidote. Hunting down zombies seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they are even called Hyper Sapiens, but their ever-increasing amount eventually destroys the lives of the most hardened soldiers. Fortunately, Director Hurst found his inspiration in the more prominent classics of the genre, such as James Cameron's "Aliens" and ?? of course - George A. Romero's death trilogy, especially "Day of the Dead". Fortunately, he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who recorded recordings of the current video game in his movie (why?!?) And * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI techniques. The HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence that chopped up female bodies and detailed amputations, but it doesn't really become nauseating or shocking. Of course there is not the slightest bit of excitement to enjoy, and all the horrible horror clich√© features here too. The movie is very fun as long as history writer Mark Altman does not try to explain the origin of the zombie epidemics. They run like their brains hanging out of their skulls, so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths. Especially when the explanations are given by a blond sorority plains that obviously have no idea what all the medical terms mean. Just avoid being bitten, honey.
