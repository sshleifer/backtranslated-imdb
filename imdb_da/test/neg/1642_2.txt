I mean, you just love the Italian film industry. Someone came up with a post-war day action film ("Road Warrior"), and the Italians were busy for years making a rip-off after the other. Then another came up with a successful barbaric movie ("Conan"), and the Italians were busy ... uh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites being Umberto Lenzi's "The Barbarians" starring to the Paul Twins), the Ator series was created. And the other is probably the worst (or best, depending on your point of view). Ator is called back to action by his old teacher, who has discovered a kind of nuclear power that must of course be protected so that it does not come into the wrong hands. The old one sends his daughter to Ator, and after a few complications, Ator, his sidekick Tong and the girl have returned to the castle, which in the meantime has fallen to some evil people (of course an old "classmate" of Ator). Somewhere along the way, the heroic trio forget about the plot and exterminate a huge snake-growing cult for the fun of it (not until some virgins are sacrificed). Just in time before the crazy finally loses its mood and kills the wise teacher, our heroes remember their duties, invent hang gliding and grenades and save the day. <br /> <br /> Included: horribly occurring by all participants (especially O'Keeffe), incredibly hilarious "special effects" (just bid on the snake battle scene, which must be a homage to "The Bride of the Monster" ), badly staged combat scenes, many continuity errors (Ator flies two different hang gliders during the climatic battle, watch it, just one example) and a total lack of understanding of the concept of history (cavemen, "civilized" barbarians, castle builders, all thrown in a movie). <br /> <br /> If you are, like me, dedicated to bad movies, this is one of the series to see you will end up with ROTFL. For the records: The Malta-listed third part is actually quite observable. Considering Joe D'Amato's other efforts, this is probably his most entertaining movie since he certainly failed to deliver watchable horror or erotic movies. But I strongly believe that this was completely by accident. <br /> <br />
