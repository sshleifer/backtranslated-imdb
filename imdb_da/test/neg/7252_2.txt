I don't think the number of blunders military and strategic contained in this turkey can be beaten. Everything in this mess was done on the cheap and made soldiers look really stupid. Examples: At the start, the 2-star General is strategically advised by a lieutenant and undoubtedly accepts it. The card used by Lt. Shows enemy positions, but apparently they only have a single narrow valley that can be used to advance on the battalion (although the card showed a dozen more). The rear guard takes position, from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed. They pound our heroes from high ground, but this superior firepower makes little difference. A single enemy tank continues almost at the end (initially referred to as armored divisions), continued by a lonely infantry point (!), Moving extremely slowly without covering the scout area and then abandoning the thought when he considers it to save for to continue - a most bizarre scene. The soldiers cover a hole. All around them are ice and deep snow, but in the cave is not a yard from the entrance a deep sausage through which they all wait repeatedly - their feet will last a few minutes before freezing. Later, the survivors waded pathetically slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit. Remember it is deep winter and the soil is frozen. Yes right! <br /> <br /> And further on, it goes. They call commands to positions on the higher ground, they lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to step on them (!) Initially, some soldiers who had been awarded the Congress Medal are credited. Was he blind or has Director Fuller ignored him? Really the most irresponsible soldiers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them hides in his own injured leg with a bayonet and eventually pulls a piece of shrapnel out, without a hint or moan. He announces that it should qualify him as a surgeon. Now it was fun.
