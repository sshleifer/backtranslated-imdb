Two little girls make a friendship. You try to convince the other, she is a witch. The other is a pushover that bends to what would be the witch's will. On and off the film, with the meaningless interaction between the two little girls, with many dramatic cut away, they pose as "shocking" questions. You know the kind of cute, small children should not ask, for example. "How do you make an appointment with the devil"? Oooh ... scary. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, pushover is ill to be controlled by his witchy friend. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But when it comes you will not come at least. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this movie might have been scary for a very religious 1960's Mexican screen, but it doesn't even hold up as a charming relic. It just pulls on. It's boring. It's meaningless. It should not be seen. <br /> <br /> There are many here who have many good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other works and of course the common denominator all says about meaningless movies: "Oh, the cinematography is amazing!" These reviewers have another point. But for those who found this movie without prior knowledge, who does not care about its "photograph", its "atmosphere" or its ... what else has it - for those viewers, who just wants a * good * movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, people: <br /> <br /> Skip it.
