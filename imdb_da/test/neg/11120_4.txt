Apparently at the beginning of 2005, the SciFi Channel threatened to release the incriminating images they have by John Rhys-Davies, saying: "We need to star in another SciFi Original." The scary thing is, he is actually quite wrong in this movie. It really says something, as this is a silly sci-fi creature feature; You have to put some feelings into it to be well-behaved. Unfortunately, no one else does. It is your stereotype "aunt-run-amok" movie on a cruise ship. Cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, Navy SEALs think they have everything under control, but they don't know what to do with, and they all end up dying, a girl jumps into "movie sexpot" - The role of Rhys-Davies daughter and creature is about 100 or so masters. What this movie has for it is, it's very fast and lively; You never get bored or waiting for another kill. However, it does not make any difference, and it is silly that this thing crawls over the ceilings and cannot be hurt by the Navy SEAL machine weapon, but can be karate-kicked for submission by Rhys-Davies daughter. Kinda went back and forth to give this bad boy a 5, but for the above silliness I give it a 4.
