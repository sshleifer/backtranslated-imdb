With great expectations, I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar race this year. Part from being totally meaningless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, acted and corrected, the movie is too long. It fails to deliver the "message" it attempts to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings, and above all in its rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I have not seen in a movie for a long time (the story of Lucas whose death sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that noble nonsense). The Spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and quickly lost patience, and some of the comments I overheard were whether the members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before they chose films for the Oscar competition.
