I just have to say that this was the third worst movie I have ever seen right after the assassination of the murder tomato 3 and the starship troops. It was the horrible act. No wonder I have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the director (s). I think I'm crazy about this movie now, but that's just because I'm tired of screaming in the movie (just seen it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this movie as you possibly can and burn it so no one can ever see this horrible waste of time, money and movies ever again.
