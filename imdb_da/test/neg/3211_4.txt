Take the secret agent / James Bond dill in the 60's, blend in some of the concepts of Sax Rohmer's female Fu Manchu femme fatale and touch some absurd, ragged revisionism of director Franco - you have the man-hatred lesbian Sumuru or "The 7 Secrets of ... "- better known as" The Girl From Rio "in the United States, reminiscent of" The Man From Rio "who has nothing to do with this. Yes, it happens in Brazil, we must give it. Sumuru or Sumitra, as she is also referred to, is like a vicious version of "Modesty Blaise" played here by actress Eaton with the well-known smart smile that most of us first became familiar with in Goldfinger. There are many close-ups of her staring from the camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something uncomfortable (though she is doubled in her key lesbian scene). She manages an entire army of female warriors, colorless costumed, and rules a city called Femina or something (just outside Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which had previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru", sound great, but despite some exciting sets of designs and visuals, the same campy atmosphere follows, for example, the very dated "Some Girls Do" that came out around at the same time, which also included a female army. At first glance, you see all these armed women who are usually in a row and are interested in you, but after 15 minutes you realize that there is nothing else but creating the visual. <br /> <br /> The reason follows what works like a secret agent, a man arriving in Brazil with $ 10 million. He catches the attention of the local criminal gentleman (Sanders, hamming it up as an older Bond-type villain) who sends dark-skinned gay men in bowler hats to accost him. This sets everything up for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime master and the mysterious Sumuru (the crime master desires Sumuru's secrets). Sumuru also holds various prisoners in glass cages - perhaps it is one of the secrets. It sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond just a slow pace; There are many shots that could have used a lot of feed: A shot on an incoming flight, for example, stays on the craft, as it is close to a stop as if it had never been caught on film before. There is a similar approach to a typical sunset as if there is something unusual about it. The battle scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first ones. To add a production value, there is a scene of the real Rio carnival about halfway through. I guess there were different budgetary problems, especially in the climatic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke cover a lot of false actions, such as. The lack of just gorgeous weapons - it reminds of the times when the kids use plastic guns and let out as bullets are fired and fall without conviction. There are touches of sadism that torture a sign to get answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some limitations was lifted. But mostly you roll your eyes.
