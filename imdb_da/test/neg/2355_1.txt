Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive, and productive instructors all the time, for he is undoubtedly all these things. It takes real genius to scare generations of movie walks out of taking showers and wearing necklaces. Saboteur, however, is not creative or productive at all. Rather, Hitchcock sat down with the soul's intention to make a film for "American Pride" patterns, a particular call-to-arms, support-our-troop title, which was a popular theme for the time being. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely suppressed other important aspects of the movie, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, credible dialogue, and a floating ongoing story. <br /> <br /> Typically, Hitchcock does well with espionage, just a few years earlier, achieving cinematic grandeur with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but apparently lost his step in creating Saboteur and only regaining the same one-time storyline both his previous excursions provided easy. Without going into a deep depth here is a list of some of these movies big problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Although his face is patched on every newspaper in America, the only one who recognizes Kane, blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia do not want to run for the door because the evil ones can get hold of them and tell the party that they were "gate crashers". Logically, what prevents the spies from seizing them and saying it at any time in the evening? Moreover, should anyone recall Kane's a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when can a fan belt be cut through handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one recognizes him ... his face is on every newsletter !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Spies pick up Kane in the ghost town and assume he is the man Freeman sent to work with them ... shouldn't it have any credentials? I know that spies don't run around with names and photo IDs, but a secret handshake maybe? <br /> <br /> 6. Cop picks up Kane's escape from Freeman's house, still no one recognizes this guy. <br /> <br /> 7. How will the FBI believe in Kane without evidence? They don't even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply turns in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police are searching in the carnival car, how can they Kane with a woman? The blind man believed in Kane's history, so logically would not have reported that his daughter was missing, kidnapped or even more importantly running with Kane. Why doesn't this movie use logic? <br /> <br /> This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists in their homes and cars every day because it is nothing big. Hitchcock fails badly on this one.
