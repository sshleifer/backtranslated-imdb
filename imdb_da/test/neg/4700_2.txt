It seems incredible that the same decade that brought Star Wars to the silvery screen disgorged such untapped tripe as this and many other 'adventure' movies. I am reminded of the equally lavish but equally miserable 'Ashanti' outlined elsewhere. Regardless of which motivated A-list actors to log into such celluloid waste, it is frankly beyond this author. They must have been very, very desperate. To be honest, Roger Moore's appearance in every movie is the kiss of death. Although very beautiful in his youth, his entire acting career has been based on the ability to raise an eyebrow. Each feeling from A to B is mediated by this simple layer. His was James Bond's dog days. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, has appeared in some very worthwhile excursions, perhaps most memorably 'Paint Your Wagon' and 'The Dirty Dozen'. He has a cartoon, but he is much better when he plays it straight. <br /> <br /> The excellent Ian Holm is a throwaway, hardly recognizable blacked-up as a mute African. Everyone else just came up with their paychecks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and watchable item is the German cruiser. It looks like a very large model. But it is faithfully massive and seems authentic - just like its crew. The rest is not even lofty. The childish comedy jars of brutality and violence in a story that wobbles as if the script itself had too many whiffs by Lee Marvin's gin. Here's a director who simply doesn't know where to go. There are hints about 'The African Queen', a snatch from 'The Pride & The Passion', 'Gold' and one or two other rip-offs from movies whose titles don't come easy in mind. <br /> </ / I've seen it 3 times each time it's been shown on the television when I've been low with a cold or flu. Maybe it affects my judgment - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it to an Indiana Jones movie and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I've given it two stars; one to the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end, even though the sky knows it takes a long time to do so. <br /> <br /> I think for another Lemsip.
