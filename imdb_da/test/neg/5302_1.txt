Although I think the reviewers who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what it does wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you want a long version of how horrible this movie is, please read the review with coinlighting. <br /> <br /> Here's the short version: Shameless use of the actors name to drive the plot as opposed to using their talent (nobody brought their "one game" to this), overtly commercialism (I think that Pepsi can afford to hold an ad - or 40 - into a movie now) and a plot (???) so distorted with "rock star" cliches that it was absolutely ridiculous. Let me tell you this way. . . I was thinking of 'Wayne's World' all the time I watched this movie, but I wasn't laughing! Whenever you try to throw in Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your movie plot together, you have serious issues. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.
