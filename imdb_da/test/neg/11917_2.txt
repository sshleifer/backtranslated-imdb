Not really worth reviewing, but I suppose it is my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around out there ... Bad plays and a slow moving, absolutely terribly boring 'old age' Story, where 3 boys live, turn up and down when a man on the move appears in their clubhouse in the woods. At eighty, the boys do well with the intruder and at some point he sees himself as a kind of role model ... But all this changes ... and you still don't care about it. You will recognize Chris Penn, whose greatest cinematic impact is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa whose career peaked at 'Casper'. I was hoping for a '12 and Holding ',' The War 'or' Lie 'and all I got was a waste of time. This movie struggles to keep the audience's attention and never affect or maintain a remark about something externally interesting.
