At the Randolph Scott standards in the 1950s, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed star western. Two or three of the characters could be dispensed while two or three other characters could be given more prominently. (The humor must be completely rewritten.) The Toth handles the action well - as always - but his understanding of the overall narrative is weak.
