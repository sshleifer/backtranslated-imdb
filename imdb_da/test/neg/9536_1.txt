Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie" I was pretty tempted to put a bullet in my brain and finish my life. It is really hard to describe what this particular movie is all about. I honestly do not know what kind of man himself would finance a piece of excrement. The movie seems to have been shot on video or 16mm. I usually have no problem with SOV movies, made sharp 16mm movies, but it was just so terrible. And where did they find these "actresses"? I've seen some bad plays, but it takes the cake. See the first 5 minutes and you will see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted to distribute this god of terrible mud. This must be the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure to see. I want my 74 minutes back! If you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes without shooting the TV or committing mass murder, give a shot. What do you have to lose?
