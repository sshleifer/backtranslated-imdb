Good people, this is another stereotypical decoration of Gay life, but the extra downside includes bad acting, terrible script, no budget, horrible sound and let's not forget the impossible story. <br /> <br /> It's Christmas in New York City and our story immediately "focuses on" two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them did not let his parents (right wing, religious jealousy) know that he is gay (adds to the impulse of history because this guy is as ephemeral as gay guys coming these days) and his parents come to viusit him. They will stay in their New York apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. History continues to evolve around the parents' arrival, which no one will suffer anyway and - how it is only obvious and predictable ways - they will learn where the son is gay. Tears are cut as it was my interest in this movie. The cast of charecters acted as an introspective course at community theater. The loved ones in this movie are inconsistent and there seems to be no connection in their union. <br /> <br /> The owner is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation is undercooked and certainly did not help move the plot further. <br /> <br /> The dragqueen friend helping one of the lovers in his "time of need" is stereotyped and gives a bad name to the unique dragon art. <br /> <br /> Even though some boys find one of the lovers to have a good body (again stereotypical images), it doesn't help with this story. Stay away from this movie, especially if you are considering a purchase. You shoot yourself if you do!
