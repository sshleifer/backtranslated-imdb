I am great at acting, writing and managing, but not famous yet. My friends and I often rent bad movies just for fun and a good laugh, but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called Biker Zombies From Detroit, we knew it would be the worst movie all the time and it was! Biker Zombies From Detroit has no script! They can say they have one, but they are liars! There was a 4 minute scene with only two guys raving about women and sexuality and one could tell it was improvised. And if they have to improve, it must be least decent, but it wasn't, and you could tell the two actors to turn lines and say things that didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how horrible and retarded this movie is, here is the beginning: a girl throws out a guy, he strikes her face and knocks her up and raps her. Then we see zombies attacking and they become both zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the start of the movie! Not to mention the leading zombie voice over what carries the entire movie, trying to be vicious and thoughtful, but it sounds like Marylin Manson has a conniption fit. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever. Bottom line, folks. But watch it if you like movies without script, no plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and over 100 F words used in the movie. <br /> <br /> If this can hit video stores, my future movie will win Oscars.
