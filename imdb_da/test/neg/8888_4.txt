I promised some time ago never to get another Joe Castro movie (perhaps after "Near Death"), but I kind of ended up with this by accident, as it was a Troma release and I didn't read the cover carefully. Oops. Well, I saw it, and that is by no means good, but it is kind of "heavy in cheek" .... if it is not, then it was safe. Some frightening people from the University of Rio Grande set out to find out if Chupacabra exists because of surveillance camera recordings by a person's GUY, showing this weird thing jumping over the field of vision. And also because the person whom this thing apparently killed was the uncle of the expedition leader. There are a few camera men, one of which whines all the time, and there are some ex-marine names "Army" (?!), Who is a kind of ammunition expert or something. At least you will find Chupacabra on a guy's ranch and sit down to find it, get involved with two suspected witches along the way. The creature itself is quite ridiculous in appearance, with spine on the back and a large large long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for. Eventually, after a bunch of people are finished being killed, it also makes Chupacabra and they take it back to the university for an autopsy. So is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation from some laboratories in Puerto Rico? Uh, they don't tell us really. Not exactly exciting, but not quite horrible either. Absolutely not a wide audience for this one. 4 out of 10
