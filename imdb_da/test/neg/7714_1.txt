When one of the stars in a movie is called Sticky Fingaz, you need to know enough to stay away. Stay away. House 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies that exceed a university campus (man how it should have saved on money). As usual, the "zombies" are not given any direction, so talk about and give very little makeup or costuming. They look like the zombies in one of these endless Italian zombie cheapies from years ago. That is, they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from George Romero and Dan O'Bannon's zombie flicks. The people who fight with the zombies are all non-actors who get to shoot weapons and do a little bit more. Some who have written here feel that the sequel is a little more focused than the original. All I have to say is, I'm glad the sequel's director did away with 360-degree panoramic images that helped destroy the first movie. House 2 is still just more of the same, which means a lot of nothing happens in 80 or 90 minutes. There is a set piece that involves soldiers juggling a zombie soccer team that at least has been fun. It is not.
