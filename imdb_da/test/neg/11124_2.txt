Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (fancy term for one of the self-counterfeit losers who like to study extremely rare - read: non-existent - animals) and his crew of hunters manage to catch a Chupacabra , a large, scaly, elusive fast moving. To get it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Greek cruise ship, and some idiots open the box containing it, even though it is not said specifically. I suppose the strange gruesome sounds coming from inside were not good enough deterrent either. The monster then makes the monster; runs around biting piles out of different passengers until the ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies), a square jawed special agent who pretends to be an insurance salesman for some reason (Dylan Neal), a creaking blonde Tai Bo instructor ( Chelan Simmons), a bunch of guys with machine guns and others trying to stop it. The most important victims (which I find to be comical relief, but it's hard to tell) are an old rich bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippy terrier and a snobby gold digger (David Millbern). Apparently, the monster can be knocked out with a single tranquilizer dart, but can live through dozens of bullet hits. The Chupacabra design is acceptable (though not original), but the rest of the movie is without excitement, surprise or interest. A boring Sci-Fi Channel "original" movie; they have made dozens of films like this with almost interchangeable characters and plots, but with little changes on the creature. Now it is enough!
