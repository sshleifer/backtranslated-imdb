This film is about a fighting actor who tries to find satisfaction in life, especially love, which he has not tasted for 5 years. It's basically a movie with a man with very poor social skills, and he constantly says crazy things. The ground is hollow and constructed. The protagonist, James, is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not sufficiently explored. It is more like an empty sentence from which other subplots originate. Sadness and disappointment after being dumped is superficial. There is a serious lack of emotion in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's also not fun as a comedy. There are some fun liners, but that's it. It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with good spirits. I can't find "I want someone to eat cheese with" fun.
