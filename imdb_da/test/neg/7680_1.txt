There are bad movies, movies that are horrible, and then there is a small, rarified movie film that is so terribly bad that even after they have been seen once, the sheer horror makes it impossible to forget them for decades later. It's just such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was actually pretty good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the cigar chomping "robust guy" mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to the carrier's captain, and after Concorde comes under missile attack (don't ask) he travels to stunts like shooting a flare gun Out in the cockpit window despite (presumably) flying at Mach 2, constantly making the kind of wildly-high evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings of any real airline, beware of the passengers' impact! But the absolute worst part of the movie, at least for the dedicated airplane, like myself, is that this cruelty "star" is one of the coolest, sexiest and most technologically remarkable aircraft ever to fly. Concorde (or simply "Concorde" as its pilots refer to it) deserved much better, this abomination is similar to taking a high class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting her in a "Porky's" successor. Fortunately, the release of the always hilarious "Airplane!" The following year, the whole "franchise" brought the franchise to a well-deserved stop as anyone thinking of a fifth installment would have been laughed at by both studios and film fans. <br /> <br /> 1/10
