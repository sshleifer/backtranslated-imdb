If you came here, it's because you've already seen this movie and were curious what others might say about it. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I * really * do. And I apologize at all as Canadian (because that's what we do) that this movie ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases. <br /> <br /> I, like everyone else, rented this movie and thought to be some stupid B movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, "I liked a good laugh at a stupid movie." I will give the creators of this movie a positive comment about their 'creation': Thank you for removing REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I can see how it would have been a distraction from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record I saw the * movie, but didn't look at it. The dialogue was incoherent, and most scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I'm not writing any more about this. It's just too painful.
