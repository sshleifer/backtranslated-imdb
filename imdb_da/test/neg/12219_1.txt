Maybe it's just the format of this movie, a documentary, but I think the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue. The fact that the players are also business owners is a double-edged sword. They know better than any other feelings and complexities in the company they were in, but since they are not professional actors, they have a very bad job of conveying these feelings and the documentaries suffer. There were some really memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines, but they were delivered so badly that they would fade away with time, and the only memory I want from this documentary is that it had some good scenes that I can't remember. <br /> <br /> See this if you want a first-hand account with the .com bust and see what happened to 99% of the industry's non-instant millioners. But be prepared for some nauseous camera work, bad action, poor dialogue and an exceedingly bad movie that epitomizes the era of the Internet boom.
