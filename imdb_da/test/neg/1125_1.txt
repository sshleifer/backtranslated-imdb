I can't believe the actors agreed to do this "movie". I couldn't stand for myself to see it very long for fear of losing I.Q. points for each second pass. I guess no one on the network that aired this dribble looked at it before putting it on. IMDB ratings only go so low 1 for terrible, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases like these.
