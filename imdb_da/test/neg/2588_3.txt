I have to see this without any commercial interruption, and let me tell you, even for a TV movie, it was pretty predictable. The actors did a job-creating job with what they had, and the throw was quite done - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. The script was not only predictable (except the last scene), but the dialogue was treacly and sounded like it was lifted from a third-class Romanesque novel. Jane Seymours psychotic monologues were ridiculous. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that anyone who would scare any suspicion at all. As bad as Theresa Russell was in "Black Widow" - and she surely struck it up - at least she had a sense to play her pseudo-characters a bit straight. Seymour is a much better actress, but does not overcome the material here. Finally, the musical score is incredibly cheesy. It's almost a satire of its genre, like a Kenny G melt. A movie with such a noisy and derived script should really have gone for something edgier.
