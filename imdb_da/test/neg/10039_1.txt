I don't understand why people praise this movie. I didn't like it at all. I see it with several people. Neither of them cared for it either. Primarily. It is quite clear that another low cost studio is trying to deposit money on a big name story. The movie itself looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When watching the movie with DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. Facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and sketches added to it. I have read several books and have seen several shows on this story. What I have always caught on all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. I really want someone to really make a good movie on this one. It has always fascinated me. The bad action really destroyed the story. The little boys situation hammered it up even more. When you watch this movie. The little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about. It had no meaning why his brothers laughed at what had happened to him. It was like the witch was so threatening, but it was okay to throw baby brother to her. It's a huge story with him and his little problem. I still can't get over the little girl and say, "Mom said tobacco will tear your teeth." Frank Fox's statement and facial expressions are so bad. The scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid. The sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho. Also, the girl hovering over the bed and her little "bladder management problem" is from the exorcist. This movie lacks from talent creativity. We put the film in for a few minutes and knew immediately it was a bummer. I also noticed that they were errors in film quality. Parts of it looked like what a person could film on a home camcorder. I noticed many of the people in the credits had many more jobs. This is probably how this movie was put together. Someone said I like this story. I want to get all my friends and movies about a camcorder and a computer. It doesn't matter if we don't know how to act. As long as we get it on film and say it's good. We got the family together and made food. Then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.
