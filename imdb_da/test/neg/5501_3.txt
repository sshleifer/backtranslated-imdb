Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this movie. Firstly, the landscape and the special effects are incredible - the best, and if everything else worked so well, its strict presence made it a good movie. But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your cave and watching a movie. The story itself is full of clech√© and melodrama, and the dialogue is one of the worst things I have ever seen. And as if it wasn't bad enough, they made fun of the protagonist, and in my experience you won't, unless the movie is a comedy. <p> <p> Bottom line: I had a hard time getting into it and I wouldn't recommend it.
