This movie was * good * relatively in the first parts of it. <br /> <br /> We have a story, from 3 views. So let's find some tracks and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh wait ... neither thing matters because the FBI boys are the bad ones! Although it was a good twist ... it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the movie from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it. <br /> <br /> Is there anyone else who can't see why the twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it is bad because it has nothing to do with the previous hour and twenty minutes. There is no connection with the killings. <br /> <br /> The killers are in about 5 minutes of this movie (as murderers) and the two FBI agents are only 15 minutes from the previous hour and twenty. <Br /> <br /> We get it ... surveillance ... Oh, killers are voyeurs. WHAT DOESN'T SENSE, because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths. And the hour and twenty-minute surveillance we see on the 3 stories goes out of the window as everyone is dead for 5 minutes. All this makes the end even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a bunch of FBI agents in the beginning ... which FBI agents sleep together? Everything in the same room. To be found and murdered by amateurs and then imitated by people who know nothing about being FBI agents? A police officer 3 meters away apparently cannot hit anyone with a standard police question that can shoot more shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel this could be right when they make absurd leaps, they think we will believe. The other thing is the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after they are revealed as the murderers with a girl standing in the field somewhere
