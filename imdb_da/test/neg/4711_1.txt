Terrible play, horrible script, totally unrealistic. The Bumblebee flies nonetheless exemplify the clich√©s and sentimentalism which film studies love to slam the viewer's neck. Elijah Wood is unthinkable in the primary role, and the plot points are constructed and juicy. Cook's and Wood's relationship is at best ridiculous. But the worst element in Humlebee is the script. These are some of the most emotional bad dialogues I have ever had the misfortune to hear. Hops that actually crawl inside my ears and stick my eardrum would be preferable to hearing Elijah Wood robot spit his pseudodynamic lines. I wish a "Hops project" would be carried out on me, so I could not have mercy on this stink.
