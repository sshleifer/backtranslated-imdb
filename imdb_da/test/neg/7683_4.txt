Now, "Doris Day" (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) was mistaken for thespian Ethel Barrymore and fell in love with dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Old Frenchman Claude Dauphin (like Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Frankly speaking?? What did they think? - This wildly inappropriate musical feature has Ms. Day that adorns the song standard "April in Paris" and others. There is certainly nothing as good as her Columbia recordings of the time; and nothing is approaching today's fantastic and forthcoming "secret love". Although the material does not serve him well, it is nice to see that Mr. Bolger performs. Some of the songs are unpleasant. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
