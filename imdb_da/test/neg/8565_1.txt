Well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was looking for movies to rent the other day and saw this. I heard something about this so I picked it up and looked at the back and there was a brief little review blurb on it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the head! At that moment I thought, "Well, if he likes it, then I like it!" So I rented it and finally finally got to see it last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh, and I might add that I'm reading a bit of Arrow's review, and it turns out that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half. So my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy. Well after seeing this, I once agree with Arrow (and show that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about it!) Wow, did this movie stink or what? Where do I start with why it did? Well, the movie was so boring in my opinion. Not even the cool gore bits tense me and when a beheading doesn't excite you in a movie, it's bad! The characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who wouldn't. In fact, the film showed me wrong on some points, but the worst thing is that a particular character I wanted to die did not! What the heck? And the chain between the maid and the guy she met? Didn't give birth. Of course, he was just there to be eye-catching and give her a love interest, otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror fan I must know that the "stupid horror movie" sometimes has to happen, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a movie, but those in here who crossed me! Hi? Why do you go out into the killer's room when you have to be looking for her? And it was made by the supposedly smarter characters no less. Twist .... ah, it would have been okay if it hadn't been done a billion times and I didn't have to sit through this movie to reach that point! My main point: Stupid movies that sucked me in with some words of my favorite (actually my only favorite) film critic. Jerks!
