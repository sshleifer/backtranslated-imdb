This is Jonas Quastel's debut as an instructor and to be honest, it shows. It looks as if he has thrown into any kind of camera trick he learned in the film school to try to add some style to a poorly written script that he helped write! Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others looking for the Pacific Northwest of a plane crashing his daughter's on, and also a special machine his company has built that he will also download. The first 5 minutes of the movie are either blurry or shaken or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with this type of shot and they become boring very quickly. And there are also POV shots that are right from the "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from the viewpoint (POV) of Sasquatch. The editing is sometimes very choppy, as a scene seems to change right in the middle. I heard that this movie was shot for about 12 days and I assume instead of "starting back on one" they restarted just without stopping and editing the scene together. And the rest of the movie is fade-outs from one scene to another. They are so many scenes that fade out that I lost count. Now the naked scene with Andrea Roth. It's not her. You can easily see your body double. And you know you see a bad "B" movie when in the middle of the northwest northwest choose a hot chick to go to the nearest hot spring and swim! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And Sasquatch itself is not bad when you don't really see him and he's just a blurry picture behind some trees or shrubs, but when you finally see him at the end, you are of course disappointed. First of all, he is not so tall. The actor who plays Sasquatch is only hair in some spots on his body. It's a partial suit! And he's bald! I've heard that a make-up person died during the movie and maybe it explains why costume looks fast. Some of the sound effects that come from Sasquatch are nothing more than the well-known lionesses we've all heard in other movies. I must admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he works with bad material, but he has one of the interesting faces that can actually improve certain moments in the movie. People continue to say that a good Bigfoot movie has never been made, but I disagree. I've always said that "The Creature From Black Lake" is a great movie and I highly recommend it. I'm a sucker for a Sasquatch movie, but one is just too amateurish.
