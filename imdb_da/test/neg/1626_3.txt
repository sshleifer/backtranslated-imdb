This movie has some of the worst production values ​​and editing I've ever seen. There are several instances of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines, actors are in front of actors who speak and a point where the movie skips seven pictures. Not to mention the heroine is shot in the chest, but she begins to hang! Oh, and what about the secret passage that is well lit and right in the open. Terrible. The plot is non-existent, something to do with a primitive atomic bomb and goes to the ends of the earth and a kind of cave war. Ator draws a sliding glide at some point in the movie's stupid moment. The dialogue is stupid containing such pearls as "It's all and nothing." and "I can feel it, here." <br /> <br /> The movie is a mess, a confusing, unimaginable mess. Ator is a boring hero, the sword fighting is absurd, and the plot goes slowly. All in all, it is a movie to avoid.
