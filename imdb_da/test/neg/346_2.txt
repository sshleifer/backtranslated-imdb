I think you can't imagine how these people really work ... !! Before I came to the studios to see the boys work there, I actually thought about the same thing as you do. But since I saw and did the work, guys on the TV show must do, I must say they really deserve respect for what they do all day. It really is not an easy job. And also the actors, who in your eyes can be terribly bad, are really good people and many of them can really act! I do not think the material for them can really show it, because I think this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I don't think you can judge them before you see these guys doing work! And I shouldn't have judged them until I met them, but I did and am horribly ashamed of it. So please do not judge these great people unless you haven't seen them in there.
