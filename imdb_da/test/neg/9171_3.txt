I waited a long time to finally see what I thought would be a fun caper-flick and was shocked to discover the creepy direction, unpleasant dialogue, a blurry pace, unmotivated slapstick gags, and an overall gravity that permeated the film all the way. Just not fun! The sets so cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The entire children's book does not come close to representing the couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job. For a movie that seems to target a dart on the injustice of the welfare and unemployment systems, the filmmakers have no problem being unfair themselves, so the Latin American, black and gay stereotypes are played at such a cruel level. The look of the movie resembles any episode of Love American Style. This is not a compliment. Adherent seventies fashion species are abounding in this world of white collars theft that only gives an air of implausibility to any situation. Outside of a clever introductory idea, and two talented stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this dated exercise in social commentary comes out as forced and means spiritual to minorities, especially to homosexuals. If you want a better captain's movie, you're better off with The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. Now it's fun!
