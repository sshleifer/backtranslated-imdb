I looked forward to this year's man, a couple of girls at my work said it was a great movie, and my mother said she liked it so I waited for the rent and saw it last night. I must honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment. I barely went through it, to be honest, the start started quite well and very well, but then it became too dark and not in the movie, I looked from the trailer. It looked like a good comedy so it turned into a very dark drama, it wasn't even that interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we had about the government conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top-notch show and has an action where many people want him involved in politics just because he seems to have a good grasp on what to do improved. So he does what he runs for the presidency, but many doubt he can win because he is a comedian, but he wins! But Elenore Green, who makes sure all the voices are drawn, tries to solve a computer error, but when the government tells her not to correct it, they try to get rid of her, and Tom soon realizes that this might not be the job wanted. <br /> <br /> The action was fine, the direction was ok, it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion. As I said, it was just a dramatic change of genres, because if you see the trailer, you'd think it was a comedy, and when you start to see it, that's what you get, but then it just becomes a very dark and something scary drama. I wouldn't really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
