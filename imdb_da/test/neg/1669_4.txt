This was an unfortunate 1970s comedy, poking fun in the psychiatric profession and in Beverly Hills. I didn't mind, but I objected to the irreverence of marriage and religion: two issues that secular filmmakers (meaning for everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) just can't stop waste. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays a scuzzy character, "Donald Becker" who walks around with a cleric's collar, insulting me, but when has Hollywood ever been concerned about abusive Christians? <br /> <br /> Yet, the film has its entertaining moments and even a little charm in spite of evil. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a nut and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry she didn't have a bigger role.
