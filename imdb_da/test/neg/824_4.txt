If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, Ali G is immensely better. I have no masterpiece, but at least it is a movie. Borat is complete waste and I do not understand how it is considered better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can't put my finger on it, something is wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes is as if written by a 15 year old, not by an adult screenwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Coh's lower body are quite tasteless. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually comes together as a comedy, and there are also some valid jokes, it's funny: for example, how Ali G joins the government to do something outrageous and stupid in public (unfortunately true in today's western society: people get careers to do stupid things in public), also alias advice on immigration policy and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali G generally remains a sympathetic character, though some kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's okay to see, it's quite fun. <br /> <br /> But never ever see Borat, it's terrible and makes every intelligent movielover sick.
