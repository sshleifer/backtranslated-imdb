Hysterically funny !! I would have sworn Ed Wood wrote this. Terrible. I loved every frame. Bad movie aficionado is, this is your trophy! I'll see it again. Words can't explain how entertaining this movie is. Pare's career should be deeply low, but I really think he's heading in the Leslie Nielson direction. He was perfect for this. Terrible, just awful !! You will love it !! Get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have time for your life. It's a MST3000 party waiting to happen. Enjoy!! It's worth renting !! You like the "Colombo type" policeman and the comic relief relief. The bad guy wants you on the floor laughing. He's also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good there. I don't know what the budget was, but they get it back because this movie is destined to be the year's best accidental comedy.
