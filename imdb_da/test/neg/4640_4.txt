Another day - this movie requires you to see it another day to understand it. I enjoy watching Shannen Doherty and I was very interesting to see how well Julian McMahon and Shannen seemed together after the roles they played in Charmed. I can definitely PRAYER the actors' abilities throughout the film, even the director - but the plot ... what happened? I'm lost to words because I'm still confused. I have to be loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot. I also have to recommend that you see it, because despite plot frenzy I would still see it again and again.
