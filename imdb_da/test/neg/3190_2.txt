I give this piece of Hollywood waste 1 out of 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next guy. I can also take just silly comedies and actually sit back and laugh at it. But this movie had nothing to laugh about with OR. <br /> <br /> I like almost all the actors in this movie. So I thought I would overlook what many people told me about it (my fault for not listening). I was just mortified on how silly this script was! Just ridiculous and not even fun. The only fun scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when they saw other movies or on TV. I was very disappointed and I really want to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then sign up to be in it! Bad decision about their parts ... <br /> <br /> ********************* MAJOR SPOILER *********** ************* <br /> Okay - here's my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters look back on this story about Jewel (Liv Tyler ) after that fact .... so how can Paul Reiser go to a therapist who remembers the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene by being crushed by the dumpster !!!! Can anyone answer me?!?!?!?!? Major goof from the filmmakers page ..... No one noticed this?!?!?!?!?!?!
