Hollywood has made many strange films over the years, but no stranger than this. WHY this movie was made, I will never know, nor how Paramount could have thought it would sell tickets in 1947. It's the strangest mix of genres I've seen for a long time, a movie that really doesn't know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of Germany in the days just before WW II began. Ray Milland, a fine actor, is stuck as an escapee from Monty Python, all the very exaggerated English prep school dialogue. In Germany, he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him travel under cover as of course another gypsy. She plays her part as the typical Viennese operetta gypsy caricature, like the other "gypsies" in the film. But there are also Nazis who are not fun at all. And then Milland finds that he starts to think like a gypsy, and it's not treated like a joke. Sometimes the music is a light comedy, sometimes a drama. Every time the Nazis come up, the film performance plays Wagner, which is fun in itself. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a comedy or it could have taken the situation of the eyes seriously and made a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are suggested in this movie, but neither persecuted. What we are back with is a really strange mish-mash genre that must have embarrassed everyone (except the instructor) involved. <br /> <br /> Bizarre.
