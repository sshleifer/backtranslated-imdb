Whatever you have heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It's not worth investing for over two hours to see stereotypically troubled teens, dancing, singing, learning and staring at girls in changing rooms. <br /> <br /> Every clich√© finds a cozy little home in this movie. There is a gay teenager looking for acceptance. It would have been good if it had been treated as something more than a secondary plot point. There is a ghetto-child who has too much attitude - what was I surprised? And guess what? They all want to become big stars, find fame and happiness, and they will all be willing to crawl over their own mothers' backs to get it. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this movie is remembered for its music. But in reality, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still too cheesy to be of true quality. The two most popular songs are also nothing. "Fame" is meaningless fluff drowned out of the sheer play of a massive dance-in-street scene. And "I sing the body Electric" (what in Bubba's name does it even mean?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. Bad plays, tasteless dialogue and hack direction (after all, from the director of "Evita") only marginally helped by Michael Seresin's appropriate regular camera work. But filmography alone cannot carry a movie, especially one that is uninspiring and meaningless like this.
