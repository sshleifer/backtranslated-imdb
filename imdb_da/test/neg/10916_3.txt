1983 was a bumper year for Stephen King books that made it to the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released within a few months of each other. While The Dead Zone was an easy choice for the pile, Christine and Cujo were both pretty poor and it is a nearby one that is the smallest of the two. If you press an answer, I would say Cujo - marginally - is the weakest. <br /> <br /> Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, fresh from the success of Elliot's mother in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) hangs on a thread. She has had an affair with a local worker and is now resident as to whether to leave her husband. Entered into marital grief, young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic, and a beautifully slaughtered child with a dark chronic phobia, often lead to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby mechanic yard for repairs, but when they arrive, their car stops splitting. Things get much worse when they discover that mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) is not there (he has been killed by his dog Dog Cujo, a giant St. Bernard who was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) Soon Have the dog caught them in their car and try everything to get into the vehicle to tear these two casual victims away from each other. The weather is hot and hot; not a living soul knows that they are where the car does not start; and the dog seriously wants their blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a really tight siege thriller, but it never really clicks on gear. I have read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for the king - so it is hardly surprising that the film version is so small. On the printed side, King could at least generate a degree of excitement, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a St. Bernard simply isn't very scary. The "visual" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo is a St. Bernard. In the book it was possible to forget this. In the book, Cujo sometimes seemed almost to assume a monster. Even with the relatively short operating time of one hour and a half, Cujo becomes a boring and patiently stressful experience, occasionally unintentionally fun and certainly never as exciting as it would be. They even omitted the book's gruesome gruesome ending and replaced it with an "all good ending good" conclusion so the audience can go home with a cheerful mood !!! Lime this down as another child king adaptation.
