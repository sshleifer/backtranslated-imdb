There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a serious talented director. Many of his films are undeniable classics who have been testing the time and paying close attention to this day. This list may include The 39 Steps, rear window, north-northwest, dial M for murder, dizziness, birds, distrust and a few other movies. <br /> <br /> But "Suspicion" is not aging well at all and is really so opaque that it seems to me that it was probably a bad movie, even in the 1941 standards. The list of scenes that work well can be noted on a matchbook with a crayon. The scripture is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the play seems so forced and timid and borderline amateurish all the way through that it's almost incredible. Joan Fontaine tries to shore things up, but she is on a smooth slope, and Cary Grant doesn't provide much assistance. His performance is sometimes so sometimes that I have seen better performances in colleges or college theater experience courses, where a chemical engineer appears for the first time without formal education. After approx. 30 minutes watching this movie you can find yourself reaching the DVD sleeve in the dark to see if you accidentally downloaded a special edition version paved together without any editing. The subject is serious, but the film has a silly and tired feel to what just seems so out of place that you become numb with confusion. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" is basically unmatched and another very very overvalued BAD movie.
