As a cartoon, Spytroops Movie was pretty bad. It is only 44 minutes long, but there are several battles that culminate in the destruction of COBRA's headquarters. A downer was the very beginning of the movie. An animated match that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been a kind of fighting simulation. On the other hand, it was a big refusal and the rest of the film lacked credibility. Then the question of Shipwreck was tied together with his parrot and thrown into a room where no one had checked for several days. Whatever happened to surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base had only a handful of characters and the rest was BAT robots. Apart from many corridors, the COBRA base did not seem to have any weapons, tanks, trucks or other equipment. Then it was the stupid notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The reason was stupid, even though it was intended for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls and even Barney Dinosaurs give more attention to their plot. The people were not bad, except that I could never understand anything that Destro said, and Cobra Commander was stupid and not much of a villain. In fact, apart from Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comical and hardly impressive. The GI Joe characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and beachhead were the worst. Shipwrecks are written as a goof ball, and Beach Head sounded like some young people in the 1990s were surfing. I think the author, Larry Hama tried to make a character appealing to teenagers, but he was a decade from the mark. Just Listening to Beach Heads Spicoli surfer talk (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) I wondered if the new GI Joes would smoke a dube before the big mission. <br /> <br /> CGI was pretty good except that Cobra Commander had a jerky spastic walk and the vehicles didn't seem to be very realistic at all. The flight tank and explosions were not very impressive. Old style animation would have been much better than this. When Hasbro wants to make things cheap, they got what they paid for. I had trouble seeing it all, it was just boring and lacking any soul or GI Joe spirit. Even the old GI Joe advertisements would have been better. In fact, the DVD contained extras such as four or five current advertisements for GI Joe Spy Troops, and these advertisements were much more entertaining than the movie. Commercials had more child-oriented fun and spirit. The advertisements were lively while the movie was dull.
