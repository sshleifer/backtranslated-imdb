I watch this movie some time ago, and the only thing I can remember about the movie is how terribly incredibly bad it was in my top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. And to believe I had to persuade my friends to get this movie out on the video store, my reputation has been slashed because of this movie will my friends ever trust me again? I doubt they always say that they do not judge anything about its cover, they were right when I looked covered in skins / gang boys I thought wow it looks good as it had a lot of skin head on the front cover that runs up with metal beams. WILL NOT SELECT THIS MOVIE. I can't think of anything else to say that the play is bad the story is bad, it's just bad.
