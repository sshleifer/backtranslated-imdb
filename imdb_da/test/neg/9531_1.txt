I am one of those people who respect any movie maker as accomplished, every movie I watch, I usually respect (though I admit I choose carefully) and appriciate for what it is. Not anymore. This really is one of the worst scripts I've seen produced as a movie ... so much so I felt compelled to warn others out of it. The dialogue was really incredible, the main protagonist was about the last person I would be interested in finding out more about. A scene was an old school friend 'tells it as if it was' made me laugh alone, because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtitle of an already concluded plot. The direction is glib at best and in worst case film production by number. Comparing this movie with the atmospheric majesty of a movie like Five Easy Pieces is a travesty.
