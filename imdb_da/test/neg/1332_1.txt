Woa, talk about horrible. Do not waste your time. I wish I had seen the others use the comments first. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I didn't look at it all. It was just too terrible. The worst, sappiest dialogue ... I could go on and on again. But what really made it unmatched was the direction. The poor actors. You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak, but the director didn't give them any action. If you control the director's filmography on this page, you will see why this movie had no chance. <br /> <br /> This would not even be good as a television flick. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
