I start to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorious screen tests for young and new talent. Get a first-time writer, an inexperienced instructor, a couple of TV actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. 'When a stranger calls' is a little better than most such recent deals, but is still completely by-book; riddled with plot holes and genre clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simplified. The sleek 87-minute maturity is heavily padded with inconsistent friends and a pointless cheating girlfriend. The killer is devoid of even the token motivation of Jason or Michael or even the killer of the original film, and as a result, it is never particularly scary. The police behave in such an incredibly inefficient and lazy way to confine themselves to professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to procedures he succeeded with Lara Croft, but his governance is certainly generic and has no real talent or vision indicators. The performance is routine, dark times replacing true horror, and the scares are of the tired cat-in-closet assortment. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and production design, however, is above average for this kind of film. The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Though an ounce of dramatic originality is lacking, it seems like a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller, and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk.
