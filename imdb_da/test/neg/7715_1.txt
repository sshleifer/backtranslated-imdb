I used to work in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night. <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible, there is no redeeming quality about it because it actually takes a reputable subgenre of movies and just goes about destroying it. If the first movie was not low budget enough, then the movie really takes the peek that is being arranged (mostly) indoors and at night ... therefore avoiding the scenic price setting of the first movie. In the first 5 minutes of this movie, a college lecturer runs comically over an attractive student. Instead of being mortified, the lecturer apologizes half-heartedly, and the girl mentions it even though he is thrown over the car's bonnet (he jumped up as he approached her) that there is nothing to worry about ... after which he attack her with a ball rod and kill her! If this is not odd enough, he will attempt her and bring her back from the dead .... and then feel the need to remove her clothes to do so. Soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is fierce throughout the film and is honestly the only real thing to keep the average male viewer interested ... just like the swim scene in the first movie ... but even said that movie goes from bad to worse with his bad character acting, crazy dialogue and absurd plot revolves .... why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes .... it's just a lot very bad movie
