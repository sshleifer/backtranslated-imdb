I think this program is a nonsense. All they do is argue and slap each other over the face and they call this play? These people get paid a lot of money for this, and most of them can't even act to save their lives. Also, the story lines are awful and after seeing it for a few minutes I get bored. I like the way Harry Hill takes mickey out of it on his TV show 'TV Burp', for example. the weak joke "Princess and the pea are not exactly Shakespeare is it?" there was Sonia and Naomi in stitches. I can't see how fun it is. I think it's a waste of everyone's money for their TV license, so it can be seen 4/5 days a week. Is there nothing better than this?
