Hmmm, not a patch on the original from the Shaw Brothers. The battles are average and look very clunky. The story is as expected from a 70-year-old Kung Fu movie, confusing and bold. Stupid voices for women who are baptized in posh English accents for men. I hit it early and I love martial arts flaps. Get the original, it's so much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, I bought the wrong flick what I wanted was Shawbrothers movie. I just started commenting, I only do foreign and martial arts movies. It's just the beginning of my movie collection, I own most modern martial arts flags. Hope you do not waste time looking at this, it is only for bad fans of the 70's Kung Fu.
