I remember years back, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to be in a romantic movie because he felt his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does, but not in this movie. A huge waste of time, no history, no sign development, no chemistry, nada. This was not the vehicle we all hoped that this movie would be boring and a big disappointment. Don't even look at the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was, of course, trained in working a kitchen, moving around, presenting a bowl, but this was not the food network, nothing taught here, and when her counterpart appeared, probably a romantic interest brewing, where was chemistry. The poor slob on the second floor of her building is trying every ploys to connect and no character development there. The loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness. The sister's daughter was just plopped here and there with something to draw you, NOT. Just waste movie time. The promoters certainly did their job to put this missing glossy film on every network that tempted you with all sorts of teasers. Sorry to say, don't use a crown.
