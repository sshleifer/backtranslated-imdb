Nothing but the void, a pleasant one for those who have known in the eighties, but dull for those who are not interested in it. NO manuscripts in this movie, but one totally wanders in an underground New York full of aristocrats and nightclubs. It is pointless, meaningless and naive. But not quite uncomfortable.
