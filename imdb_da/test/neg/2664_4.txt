James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (the nickname "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees the surly boys as the new superintendent in a state reform school. Tepid genre entry where Cagney is the whole show; He dominates the picture, but only because there is not much else of interest going on. Jimmy gives what is expected of his hard-boiled persona, who can be satisfying if you are ready for a quick solution. The direction (of Archie Mayo, although Michael Curtiz is said to have helped), is straightforward without being particularly gripping, even though the narrative slides in the other half, grinding the film down to a messy conclusion (even Cagney's Patsy is lost in shuffle). Remade in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** from ****
