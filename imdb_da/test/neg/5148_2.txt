***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> I suppose you shouldn't expect much from one made for TV movies, but this one was particularly bad, the plot was a good idea, but poorly finished, the play was not very good. And the end of the movie was just awful. The protagonist was completely normal all the way through the film, and then suddenly, when we discover she was the killer, she just becomes a mentally challenged psychopath. It's completely pathetic. There's only one reason to really see this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, even though we haven't all seen her in a swimsuit before? Don't forget to see this waste of time yourself, if you want a film about the beauty competition world, then see "Drop Dead Gorgeous" instead it is only an infinite number of times better.
