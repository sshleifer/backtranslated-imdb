Two things change from then. First of all, I'm not a kid anymore, and the second of the new Seagal movies is just awful. It is in my opinion the worst movie ever made with Derailed starring by Jean Claude Van Damme. There is no plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some horrible action scenes that are painful to watch. I love action movies but this is not an action movie .... This is not a movie ... this is a group of annoying scenes linked in annoying way to killing viewers love for the action movies. I'm sorry, but I have no respect for anyone who liked this movie. He has a serious intelligence problem so.I hope that Seagal will make some new good movies in the future. Good luck for him!
