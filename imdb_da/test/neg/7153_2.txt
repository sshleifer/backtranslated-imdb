This is a road movie. At least the movie is in yellow anf, I think it's a road movie (?). I can't say very positive about the delivery. It's bad to shop, certainly their English. The camera looks like it's made by a kid who is a bomb with a counter, and suddenly a beetle falls from the sky. As it was so clich√©, we actually make it all the time - and that was the funniest thing in the movie. This movie has to be released in America, but I'm not sure you have to go because it may indicate it's the quality we produce. The explosions look dull. Basically everything is over the top. Everything is just too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the babe etc. Find the whole cliche part in other movies, put them together and you have the delivery.
