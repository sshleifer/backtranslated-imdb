After three hours in the cinema hall, the strongest impression was that theirs is something wrong. It was clear that the directors forgot to lead, the actors to act and most importantly the author to write. Evervbody shouted for no reason and made a curl. The script moved over and over again with lots of avoidable twists and ends in now, also known as Priyadarshan's theory of convergent actors at a single point. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama, but somehow managed to annoy this time, it also made the habit of every actor's inability to respond directly to them. Single questions like "what is your name will be repeated N times". Finally, it was wrong that the director forgot that his audience has something called intelligence.
