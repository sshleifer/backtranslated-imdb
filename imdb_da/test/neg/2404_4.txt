Very curious that Nichols and Hanks would do this, of course they think so. Strange because it had to bear the title "Charlie Wilson's War the Lie." How could the timeframe leave the real story that while ridding the Russians Afghanistan gave CIA support to the Taliban and today's world of terrorism. In 1990, Bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia as a Jewish hero who, along with his Arab legion, "brought down the mighty superpower" of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> To avoid any connection to Osama Bin Laden is to say again, Hollywood cares little about historical truth. Charlie Wilson, a patriot, is hardly more like a congressman who has gone crazy.
