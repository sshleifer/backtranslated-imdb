First thing first, I'm by no means a discerning movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who get movies just to pick the bugs and criticize, just like most others I am looking to be entertained. I basically want to see some kind of movie, no matter how bad someone says it is (sometimes a movie is so terribly made and written that it invokes a kind of shame of humor that I get a kick out of). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on television and didn't know what I was watching. It was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie, and had too much sex, insinuation, and swear to be a child's movie. In fact, I doubt myself that children would be entertained by it. The humor (quite generous though call it) was so pretentious and campy, I couldn't see how anyone with half-mindedness might find it fun. The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie Mac and ridiculously put their name and time on / in something so hurtful. Luda's character was such a cheap trick for laughs that fell extremely short of his goal. The plot had no meaning, the story must be the worst series of events ever put together on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I start discussing specific instances of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is, it really has to ask you how much time these authors have spent on their knees and try to get it done. <br /> <br /> J
