Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be the judiciary to do what he wanted. You may be right, but that's how SEAL really is. I earned several months with a SEAL team out of Norfolk, VA. In fact, I should say they used our ship to deploy in Europe for a few months. I was a mail consultant on board and every day these guys would try to get their mail. Since only one person was allowed to retrieve the mail every day, we issued a passport to a person. Every day another SEAL would come up as being another. Well, after the third time, I said no to them until I had proof of who they were. They went NUTS !!! I thought they would bust through my cage, gag me, and then steal the post. Fortunately, I had not only the President on my side (Navy), but the Federal Government (US Mail). It was the only time I saw the SEALs stop from having what they wanted. They were allowed unlimited land law, where we had to be back on the ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France, and the two SEAL only got 1 week detention on the ship while a seafarer was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop, and he got a court fight. Is it strange why SEAL's retention is over 85%? As a SEAL, you are God. So this movie makes a pretty precise work of portraying how a SEAL works and thinks ... unfortunately it is so incredible for normal people that it comes out as being false.
