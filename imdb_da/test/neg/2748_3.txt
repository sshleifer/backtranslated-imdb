Before I watched this movie, I had heard some negative comments about it. But when I looked at it, I thought to myself "OK, it's a little slow, but it's quite interesting". When built against the end, it created a complex moral dilemma that led to a shocking yet within the framework of the film, totally credible decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed through, it would have been a huge end and would have given me a very good impression of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, due to an end that not only polishes emotionally, adheres to an unnecessary happy-end ending with no real emotional credibility, but also within the context of the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to you that one of the characters takes an action that should end with life, but inexplicably does not. Incidentally, tell me if I missed something here and there is a reason she survives as I just couldn't, how logical she could have, and it ruined the whole movie for me. <br /> <br /> This said, all three leaders are putting in powerful performances, although Kevin McKidd's character's transformation at the end goes a little further than convincingly, creating a very strong ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended if you manage to go out when the mother and the sister lie on the bed. But look no further than this, unless you only have one clamp, but more mountains, salt.
