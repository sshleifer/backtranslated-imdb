Okay, now I know where all the boring cop / homicide TV shows came from. I think they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene of the Crime" feels more like a television episode or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who collides with his superiors ... the aging policeman who does not want a desk job, despite failing eyesight ... the ruthless rookie ... the double-crossed lady ... < br /> <br /> I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but generally I found this movie boring because I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept tuning out when they discussed the matter ... something about bookies and informants. And oh yes, there was a stripper played by the formerly healthy Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did she continue to call Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Wasn't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A sign from a children's book? What is it that has to do with something? I suppose I just don't get a hard guy Film Noir-ish good jargon. In fact, much of the dialogue made me murmur "no one speaks like that!" But I could relate to a scene where the policeman's wife (Arlene Dahl) who worries every time he goes to work realizes that she might not have made her husband the center of her life. Yes, I know the feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them that there is a constant fear of their safety. So there are moments of truth in this movie, under the stylized dialogue and atmosphere that tries so self-consciously to be gritty and REAL, that it actually seems unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A little background: this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began putting an end to the healthy musicals that made the MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to movies. I pretty much hate Dore Schary. Perhaps we can blame him for all the pretentious, gloomy films made today and awaken in the ugly "truths" of life, focusing on (and in my opinion helping to continue) the worst humanity rather than that best. No longer raises us how classic films were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what we still need this kind of distraction today! There is still plenty of depression and lots of war. And what do people turn to today when they want to escape? Trashy, brain-deadening Reality TV. Thank you, Dore!
