I found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had wallpapers exchanged between different rental locations. 'The man who shot down Everest'. Hmm ... never heard of it. The box sounds like some Japanese guy who always wanted to ski Everest and actually did it. Sounds interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was documentary style. The first part can be summarized as follows: "I have always wanted to ski down Mount Everest". This is followed by some pictures of the preparation for the event. Lots of preparatory footage. OK, it is assumed that it requires a lot of preparation. Then we are treated to a lengthy piece on the skier, Yuichiro Miura's life philosophy, etc. Several fillers follow, and I start to wonder where the skiing fits into this show. More preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain. More philosophy is shown. Eventually they come to the mountain, and maybe he might come around to ski down the friggin. Lots of climbing pictures later there is a description of the parachute unit designed to slow down Miura's speed on the steep slope. Finally he winds his skis and gets ready to go. <br /> <br /> He's out ... He walks about twenty feet, and his ski shoots out beneath him, he calls at the parachute and tumbler in an exciting bundle some distance down the mountain, and that's it. That's the way it is. What was it? <br /> <br /> OK, I can buy that he always wanted to ski Everest, made extensive preparations and actually tried it with the camera crew in tow. It didn't work, and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself, so what real hubris would inspire the man to release a movie of it and call it skiing down Everest? Perhaps the title "The Man Who's Feet Shot Out Under Under Him, and he is wearing on his Ass Down Everest" is just too long for the tape box.
