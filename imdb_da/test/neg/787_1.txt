This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the first time ever written a review of a movie I made myself - not for any class assignment. I think that alone alone says something about this movie ... not a good thing! I am no cross journalist or critic (although I have seen my fair share of movies), but I found this movie so terribly painful to see, it was necessary for my own fun to venture the experience. How better to do than IMDb? When I forced myself to sit through the film, physically angry from the inability to connect points, I was sure there would be some "light at the end of the tunnel" - a revelation to explain what in samhe. was going on. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as a dog ****. After several steps to go through certain scenes, I still couldn't conclude anything. I found myself wanting to shout "Does it matter to anyone?" I would recommend not wasting your time, but then again, if I were you, I would probably like to experience it myself. If so, take a crossword or something so that you are not bored.
