Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing joined in a horror movie; It always sounds like a fantastic plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who have previously played together in stunning genre excursions such as "The Flesh and the Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave" are paired with a mid-70s satanic theme exploitation. How can this possibly go wrong? Well, it can unfortunately. To my deepest regret, the "Minotaur's Land" cannot be called mediocre, and despite the cast, the exotic attitude, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a distant small area of ​​Greece, especially near an archaeological site, more tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his talented followers continue to feed them into a flaming Minotaur statue. Cushing, who is never so bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek means that you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caves. It is of course quite practical if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, Father Roch - the pastor of a few cities earlier - decides to investigate. The "Minotaur's Land" is a tedious and extremely slow-paced effort that never really does any great effort to create a satanic atmosphere and does not bother to deepen all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an exciting creature of Greek mythology with a bull's head and a person's body, but for an inexplicable reason, the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on boring and overly talkative sequences and loudly inappropriate music changed with experimental sounds. The only reason to even consider giving this big disappointment to a movie a chance is because of Donald Pleasance. His depiction of rude, bossy and old-fashioned pastor criticizing everything that represents modern youth is strong and reliable as always.
