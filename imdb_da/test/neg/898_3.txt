I didn't quite get the Children's O? It's one of the strangest things I've seen. The soundtrack was also quite unusual ?? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the film worse than it was. I have to admit that I would almost change it and see someone else instead, sometimes the movie seemed plain stupid to me, or boring ?? or confusing. There are a lot of sexual references in that movie? through they are also kind of confused. Probably the only phrase I will remember out of it is being "When you are alone, can you control things"? and "I'll show them" - or something like that. The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up? "Last summer as a child" he once thought? And he probably lived it to the maximum. So if you have few hours to save you can watch this movie ?? But you won't miss much if you don't.
