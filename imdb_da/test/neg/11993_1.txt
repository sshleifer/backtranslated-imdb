I was a "selected" to watch this movie in a sneak preview. <br /> <br /> First, know that this movie is based on the video game "far cry", a great game for its time (2004). Secondly, know that the director of this flick is the big uwe ball. This is a man who takes video games (dungeon segment, blood priest, mail, etc.) and makes movies out of them (VERY horrible ones ....). I still remember when I saw the ball's "king's sword: a dungeon tail". there were such terrible flaws in this movie (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 during the day and somehow at night .....) so let's get to "far cry". If you expect cool action, forget it. Really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far from real action. If you expect a cool story, forget it. orientation of the not-so-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. the actors' games make the movie a lot of fun, but in a good way. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to watch this movie for free. so don't make the mistake and pay for this bin. it's one of my favorite flicks for the bottom 100. !!!!
