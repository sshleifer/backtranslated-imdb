I waited for the movie to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me somehow, but it didn't touch any of my feelings. It bent right to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors who recited their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotions. The only one who did and was credible was the veteran, and he has probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, movies, their time and mine. If there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it's certainly well hidden, or I'm very close, which I doubt.
