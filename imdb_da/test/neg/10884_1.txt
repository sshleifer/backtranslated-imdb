I've seen many movies. In fact, I love B horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. But this "Garbage" (I refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film) was the worst piece of shit I've ever had torture to see. I actually registered on IMDb solely for the fact that I needed a way to at least vote how terrible this "Garbage" was. I have seen "Film" (they deserve the least honor) made in cellars of high school students who were better written and instructed. I have nothing but compassion for the poor actors in this "Garbage" because they just tried to earn a paycheck. They will now and then have this spot on their plates as a virgin who was raped and got Herpes! If Writer / Director John Shiban at all has a dignity after he has, of course, beaten countless people to have it done, he should never allow himself to come near a camera again and try to use his so-called "Gifts" for something more suitable for him .... Like mopping the floor in a Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
