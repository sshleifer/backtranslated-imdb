Save some very early Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that can't be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A pathetic attempt at film making, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Despite that, I looked at it and emptied the forward button, because the play was so terrible that it was comical. Of course, the film must be an action / drama, but turned out to be a dissertation on how to NOT make a movie. Everything that could be wrong with movies is on the screen of this "dog". If you happen to do that, give it a look. It's so bad it's fun.
