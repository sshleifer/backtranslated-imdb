I just read an extra long review on the cover of this movie on this page and he explained in detail that this movie is only worth watching on the TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I find the advice really helpful! I mean, a movie trying to be so good and this exciting just really not what that movie will be !!!!! So yes, watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a star out of ten stars, give this a ten out of ten stars! Until then, my one-star review is the right, clean, pristine version of this movie only !!!!!! Do you have it now?
