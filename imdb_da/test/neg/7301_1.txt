I knew I was not watching a quality movie, as this title was included in a "B-grade video night" in a friendship. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at how bad this movie was. It was fortunate that there were many of us there to share the pain with each other ... The film is trying to tell the story of a dark future, where Hawk (a Mad Max type character) heads to save a virgin in need. In reality, the plot is a thinly hidden excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (see the final credits and 'these people are not really' disclaimers at last for a real laugh). The film often lacks direction and fails to develop its characters to any degree at all. What's even worse about editing this movie. The movie repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think this was an attempt to mimic things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's battle sequences, but if so, it fails altogether. The movie would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we were not forced to watch the protagonist, moving his head in front of the set sun for half a dozen times (yes that's all that happens in the repetitive scene). I give this movie my 'worst movie I've ever seen' award. I doubt it will soon be peaked.
