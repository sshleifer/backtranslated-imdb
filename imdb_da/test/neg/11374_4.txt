No matter which PC Enforcers Committee is responsible for this movie, one has achieved something that I never thought possible: to take some really talented actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and make you assure you never to bump into on them in a closed room, ever. The feelings underlying the manuscript are so uneven and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what the audience would find this image appealing, much less fun. Architectural students maybe? Only one scene is visually clever: Marcia Gay Hardin sashaying, all twists and rhythms, into a bar manages to radiate more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the movies added and multiplied to the tenth power. As for the other members of the cast, they will probably not put this on their resumes.
