I was really excited to see "Cold Mountain". Alas, like most movies, I'm really excited to see it was a letdown! Wasn't it for the miraculous invention called a DVD, I think I would have put my head through the screen, I was so sorry! <br /> <br /> I looked closely at Kidman and the law when they met because their characters are supposedly "determined" for each other. But the face of the law showed nothing but stupid love, while Kidman seemed to count the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we didn't understand it, cornball banjo marks her every entry), and then over the top, that's all I couldn't laugh at! Ironically, her performance serves to highlight how stiff-on-board the leaders are. <br /> <br /> Ada almost starves because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. More confusing is why none of them continued as Ada and her father were exceptionally benevolent, and (as shown on a scene) it was a very dangerous time for Negroes (as they politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for Ruby's convenience, when she sends Ada's "evil" tablet, that kind of kibosh puts on those who have more chickens! <br /> <br /> When the beloved finally returns, Ada does not need him or anyone else - which is the big joke! In fact, she can be physically intimate with Inman, but her true intimacy is with Ruby, who has turned Ada into an Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else know how they went down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod when they left Inman? <br /> <br /> I doubt Minghella recognized this when he was too busy making an anti-Bush movie. Inman tells us that he is "like any fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie", and Ada's father says, "I imagine God is tired of being called down on both sides of an argument". These "observations" are historically incorrect and abusive. While slavery was the basis of the southern economy, the causes of the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to believe that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, most of the rank and file did not care about it). For filmmakers to stamp their views on a time when such views were alien to those who lived in that time, are beyond unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is crooked and episodic. Law and Kidman are miscast and have no chemistry! The script is a little more than half-baked dialogue, and a huge bunch of clichés and banalities. "Small moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
