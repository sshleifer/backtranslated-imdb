This movie is trying to tear off the Predator, but that movie is much better. This movie has really terrible special effects and a thoughtless plot. The team entering the forest to find the cause of the disappearance of military and scientist is a combination of tough and robust male delta commands and beautiful but tough female rangers. None of them are too bright. All the signs seem to be more than willing to run into the forest alone and first and foremost into a spear or sword and their death. Some of the pyrotechnics are very large and must have cost a bundle. But the close-ups of the creature are ridiculous, like most death scenes. Every clich√© that the authors could think of was used. If you are looking for a thoughtless slaughter, this can fill the bill. The night I saw this was very slow so I sat through it all. I must admit that it has been a while since I saw something so bad. There is very little to redeem this movie. I am surprised that unwanted ones are being produced.
