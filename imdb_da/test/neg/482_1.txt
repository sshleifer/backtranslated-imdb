I love the so-called "blaxploitation" movies and have seen dozens. Some, such as Cotton comes to Harle, Shaft and Hammer, has excellent production values ​​and is very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and stupid, but still entertaining, such as. DOLEMITE does, however, rarely do anything for the genre - it's just cheap and silly and not least entertaining! It's like blaxploitation made for very, very stupid people. Years ago I saw a takeoff on the Dolemite movies on "Mad TV" and unfortunately the real DOLEMITE is no better. Like parody, the play is just awful. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can hardly read his lines, and his "karate" is a joke - with his kick openly missing the target again and again. As for the rest of the actors, many may be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out - yet they didn't even have to re-record those scenes! In fact, so much of it was that I had a hard time finding out if the movie was definitely a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite horrible action and action, there is something worth seeing about this movie you're wrong. Even for the perverters out there hoping to see some skin, will be disappointed. The naked women in the movie really look like prostitutes with luck, and there is nothing far-fetched about their bodies. I think looking at old naked - REAL old old naked - is no worse than looking at these "ladies". And for Rudy Ray, he has "man boobs". No black superhero or antihelt should see it badly naked !! For goodness cases, put on your clothing people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written by winos !!! <br /> <br /> FYI - Apparently, there are actually extensions to this movie! ! I can't imagine seeing them so you just have to find someone else to review them. I have seen PLAN 9 from Outer SPACE, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER, but I just don't think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite movie - they are so bad!
