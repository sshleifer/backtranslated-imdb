Just let me give you some advice if you are going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of invisible characters being slaughtered in a dozen different ways, then you will love this movie because everyone dies a horrible death beyond gore however, there is not much else. Where do i start: - the characters do not appeal to the audience as there are no back stories to any of them, because i did not feel connected to any of them in fact i did not like any of them and i were so sick of them that at the end of the movie I rowed for the despaired creeps to kill them all. (as he did by the way) <br /> -bad-acting; i think i didnt get it, take the asian tour guide for example first he spoke perfect english when after their little tour boat thing he somehow got an accent out of the blue, then later went to talk normal English. one of the worst conclusions for a horror: (if you can call it) After the monster / human mutant kills almost everyone, he is killed by the last two remaining idiots, or they thought! the monster / man's thing is finally killed when the beauty and nerd stick a rod through his heart / nick (it was hard to tell) and probably died it right in front of them (within reach), but later it comes back and kills them (wtf ) I mean, why didn't they just kill them when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! I think it was just too retarded, as the author did not know where he wanted the story to go. (or he was a few minutes less than 80 min, so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get 80 min worth of shed instead of 75 min. <br /> <br /> what I didn't get was why did they not just beat the damn thing while it was unconscious, instead they just went away from it as idiots and went back it was so it could come back and kill them, the only reason I gave it a 4 was on because of the gore, which was actually the only thing I saw this movie to the end and seeing them all being killed., i'm serious)
