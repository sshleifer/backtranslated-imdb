Horror movie is a curious thing, sometimes it stumbles upon a formula that works very well, sometimes they try to safely tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems, sometimes they are so bad, they are actually quite funny .. And sometimes they are "The Cavern". A good scare / thrill movie should include vagaries that keep you guessing, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivation, so you actually have some kind of reaction when they die. But The Cavern instead chooses to introduce elements that work first, only to be ignored by its own insidious storytelling. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely forgettable and any back story that can make any of them even externally interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue, making it impossible to do anything other than to laugh, as characters are picked almost randomly and in more than one apartment in the least possibly frightening way. <br /> <br /> To spoil a scene a bit, a victim is taken under a complete blackout, which might have been a little scary if the sound effect used to indicate his killing does not resemble touching pot with too thick macaroni and cheese.) Add to this formula the camera that works, makes me believe that the director has been watching too many Nine Inch Nails videos and an end, which in an attempt to be shocking, serves almost no Meaning, but to annoy and confuse the viewer, and you have an almost utterly horrendous horror movie that fails at all levels. <br /> <br /> I want to be honest with you if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie, see "The Descent" and I feel weird to say it because I didn't particularly enjoy it too the film.
