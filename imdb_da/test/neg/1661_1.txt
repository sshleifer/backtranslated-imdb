I understand the budget was low on this movie, but come on, it's really awful movie production. The scripture is just plain horrible, and it was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this movie is played as a conventional R-rated movie with lame scares and cut-away violence instead of a no-lasting untouched gore party intentionally made for video. Who were these guys fun? Like this would have been released in theaters. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible. The editing, another free aspect of the movie, is beyond amateur, and the plot, as I said before, leaves a little to be desired. There is no original about the movie. Good fans, avoid this. For the filmmakers: Try something original next time, or stop making movies together. You're not good at it. People hate a blurry rehash, especially such a low caliber. AVOID! It's not even worth making fun of.
