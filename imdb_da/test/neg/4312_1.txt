This is a worst movie I've seen and certainly the worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor has made. I can't believe a person who made movies like Teen Deewarein can create a complete hug like this. <br /> <br /> Plot of the movie itself is really defective that Zeenat must seek Meera and get her pleasure in helping her husband avoid the death penalty in Soudi Arabia. Common logic says whether Zeenat cannot easily seek Meera, so it does not want the Soudi government, so Zeenat can certainly forge Meera's signature or thumb print and produce it before Soudis. Another funniest thing is that Shankar has given a wrong address in his passport, so Indian government officials can't come to the address, but after a while, Meera Shankar gets the suitcase through the Soudi government. Wow! Doesn't Soudi's good network in India more than Indians? <br /> <br /> Nagya does a little more than cameo in the movie with Chopra's role staring Meera and seeking Meas's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad (this guy is just wasted) helping to get her as a hold. <br /> <br /> Nagya cannot speak Hindi and he has been helped by other guys translating the English dialogues he writes in Hindi. This time, it seems that his aide was in serious poisoning when he wrote dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (leaps of honesty). Within minutes of our worst nightmare, Meera not only takes this honest leap, she taps her feet to do "Imaan ka Naach". (Honesty Dance). <br /> <br /> One of the only bright spot films is its filmography and really beautiful shades. But since Bollywood has learned what is called Post-production, almost all movies have vivid colors and nicely mixed background images, so it's not that much. The conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to Chopra's or Johar's or Barjatyas, Nagyas, and everyone is ready to be hit.
