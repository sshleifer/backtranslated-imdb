This is such a crazy movie I have no idea how it came on the shelves, they must have paid the movie store to get them to put it there seriously! The story makes it quite sensible unless you are on some seriously heavy fabrics, you would surely have to be on something to see this total piece of waste so much that you wouldn't take care of what was on the TV because you're almost in a coma. The scripture sounds like it was made by a 5-year-old, and the play is worse than class school playing. The frightening special effects they were trying to make so stupid, what did they spend a whole $ 5 to make the whole movie, it looks like it! Oh my, the scene with the old woman who has an 80's hairstyle and the ugly girls in the rubber boots, I and my friends laughed so hard. Has anyone actually thought it was a good idea to make this a movie? I find it hard to believe!
