This 'schlock buster' should carry a health warning from the government. If you play it in your DVD machine, you are in serious danger of opening a reef in the spatial continuity and disappearing without trace in it - so bad is this 'movie'. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie was so successful is a sign of the modern desperate state of modern Hollywood cinema and the continuous commissioning of films that appeal to the "lowest common denominator" - though I really fear think of the "lowest common denominator" that this movie actually appeals to !! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood just did some sort of evidence-making experiment when they made and screened this movie! I can imagine the executive board meetings in the studio ... "Just how bad a movie can we actually get away with - and still make lots of money!" Holy cow, I did not understand that we could go so badly !! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only movies that are worse than this I can think of (and believe me it is close) are Die Another Day (the RIP Bond franchise I knew it) and Independence Day! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID!
