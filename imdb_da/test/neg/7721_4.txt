"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really don't have to see the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. That said, the production value is certainly here, with great zombie effects, and it has been edited quite nicely, with very effective sound design. But that's said, it's all about what's good here. <br /> <br /> The story and script are terrible. . . There are blatant plot holes everywhere. It's also fun how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces (as opposed to 28 days later, where blood in any part of the body will infect you). Also, realistically, there is little order with the soldiers here as opposed to the usual American military discipline. A 4 out of 10.
