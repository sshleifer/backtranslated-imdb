The movie "The Cave" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There was no plot, no history line, and the lighting was awful. For most of the film, I was unable to make sense in nature, as it was highlighted by lamps. The persistent "gray" spaces throughout the film were annoying. The only scene that really came through was clearly in the cave illuminated by what seemed to be a poor simulation of the conditions to be found in hell. All in all, the film was not really worth seeing. If the producers cannot make anything better than this, they have to find another job. The underwater scenes were extremely dreadful, mainly consisting of bubbles and flashlights, with occasional look at the actors. In summary, a really horrible movie with bad lighting flashes strangers.
