Think of the most unmistakable topic you can and it is 10 times worse. A woman needs to complete as many crosswords as she can during the day. We can't even see the questions and think of the words alone, we just look at her fight. The woman seems so nervous and busy doing the crossword puzzles, but for some reason she uses time distracted around the city as she could be focused at home. The actor is horrible, the actor hops and breathes as she tried to think of the words, and we stay all the way back in the dark. The New York scenario is great, but the movie is too much dependent on it, and it gets old quickly. The film plays as a rejected NYU student film. This movie has no redeeming features and I do not recommend it to anyone, ever.
