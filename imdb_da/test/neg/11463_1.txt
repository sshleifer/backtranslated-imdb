I realize that most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the movie is pitched at the much larger audience. But then why bother calling it "Solomon Kane" in the first place when the name has no negotiable value? The signs certainly have nothing to do with R.E. Howard character. Unless he has a big hat. That's where the ends of equality are. <br /> <br /> It is always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie lands over an origin story, but when you invent a whole cloth like this for a character who did not 'I have struggled No, you have already missed the point altogether. Kane is no longer the fanatic Christian warrior of the stories, but rather a former bad guy trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored, the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply confusing. Is it just so they can say "From the Creator of Conan" and hope to enter a budding franchise if the new "Conan" movie comes out of the ground? Ignoring the complete departure from the stories, the film is competent if it is quite generic in the first half, but then turns into pure stupidity in the climatic scene involving more super-damage (think three "boss levels" at the same time), none of They are at least interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I wasn't a Kane fan who was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material, I'd probably give the movie a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 Even for (the majority of) viewers who want to get into this know nothing about kane, it is pretty thin gruel.
