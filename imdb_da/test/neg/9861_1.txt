Which game over: Kasparov and the Machine are best to dive into Garry Kasparov's psyche in the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unraveled, too, because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his predestined chess computer performance. Kasparov thought, and still, that IBM cheated. <br /> <br /> Game Over is trying to act impartially, but it is clear that the director thinks IBM cheated. However, they provide no real evidence to support the cheating claim, but only evidence that IBM's security around the computer room was that IBM really had grandmasters stored in it overrides the computer at certain key periods, and Kasparov's claim that the computer was not playing as a computer usually do at a time in game two. In games two, Kasparov played a game designed to trick the computer and attempted to sacrifice a farmer in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the fine, leading to any computer loss. Deep Blue did not take bait, and Kasparov was so giddy because the computer seemed to play as a human being that he could not even see that he could have played Deep Blue for a tie and ended up retiring. The game psyched him so much that he could not recover, and after playing games 3,4 and 5 to draw, the game lost 6 terribly. <br /> <br /> The question of whether IBM cheated everything comes down to the only move in game two, where Deep Blue made the move that every human being would make, but up until then having turned on computers. Joel Benjamin, a chess master of IBM's programming team, explained in the documentary that they knew chess computers were always set up in that situation and therefore spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it would not make the mistake of other computers doing it . If you believe Benjamin's claim, then the case is clear, IBM has not cheated. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved and never told IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots from the 19th-century chess game, The Turk and Deep Blue's shot, which suggested that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human also. As a person who has an understanding of the programming, the explanation from IBM makes perfect sense - if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code, so if conditions are reached, so do and so - in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like that created by Kasparov in game 2 ever happened. This is not cheated, it does a good job of programming a chess computer. Ultimately, it is clear that the director believes that IBM cheated, and the repeated remarks about IBM's stock increase by 15% the day Deep Blue won, suggesting that IBM is cheating on pumping its stock price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there is plenty of out-of-mind in both the chess and computer science communities that Deep Blue won fairly and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his perception of computers as "stupid machines" and got psyched out of a machine that did not seem so stupid. I just wish the director had let us see the alternative statement. <br /> <br />
