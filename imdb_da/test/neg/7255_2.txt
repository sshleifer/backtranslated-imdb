Thirty percent of this movie seems to be the prototype of the Map Channel. You see a giant card for about ten minutes, so they release storage time great while you drone (drone, get it?) On about radar. Apparently, there are many radar stations in the far north that protect North America's borders from attacks by deadly polar bears. The bears never come up, but a giant Mantis does it. It was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world (yes, right. For my money it was released by global warming). It's a great prehistoric insect and it needs lots of food. Since there are no cows in the frozen north, it decides to feast on the most cattle-like creatures that it can find up there. I.E., people. It begins to attack radar stations, probably because humming from the radar dishes came on the nerves. Enter colleague Joe Parkman, the resident smart guy in the movie. He examines a plane that went down and is surprised why there are no bodies in the wreck. All he finds is one of Manti's claws. Apparently it decided to trim its nails while it was snacking on the plane's crew. Parkman takes the clock tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand-year-old scientist. Grandparent can't make heads or tails in the claw, mostly because he has missed his nap so his mind isn't working too well. So he calls a paleontologist with an alley played by the guy who was P.I. in Perry Mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he has decided that the itch must have come from a prayer man. Just a size of a commuter train. It is Luke's warm love at first sight when Col.Parkman first puts his eyes on the female photographer. The men at the base, who of course have been robbed for many years, believe she's the hottest thing to come together since Granny Clampett. Smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path to Mantis, which has destroyed some stock footage of an Eskimo village. It comes to the base looking for a snack after dinner and crushed some cheap sets quite effectively. Then it flies south and disappears. Now comes the tense hours when civilian Earth Observers are urged to sweep the sky, looking for some great flying overhead. I doubt they would in fact have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis who eats people as it would have caused panic. Probably they were asked to look for a giant 727 that was painted green and hummed because the engine was out of tune. <br /> <br /> Col. Parkman goes up in a plane to try to shoot Mantis down and smuggle the mission. Mantis lands in New York City, probably because it wanted to take a show on Broadway or visit Sex World in Times Square. The army turns it into the tunnel, and Parkman and his men make stupid suits that they borrowed from Orkin Man to step in and try to blow up the Mantis. Success! Well, almost when Mantis still moves enough, it almost kills the male Eve Arden photographer's lady. There is a lukewarm love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because colonel fat and sex are unspecified smooching. So a bit of a nauseating end.
