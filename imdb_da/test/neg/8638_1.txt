The movie starts with a story of the protagonist explaining certain crimes that take place all over the city, and then we realize that the hero is a policeman who is either suspended or is likely to be retired. I didn't have the patience or interest to confirm the above before I commented. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice, then it's time to put an end to it. I fell asleep seriously and didn't disturb the movie either. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie was about and why there were no outdoor shots. A third set of TV Serial will have several sets compared to this crap of a movie, and I'm still ashamed of the actors and producers involved in this huge choke of a movie. It should have been produced as a normal television series or maybe even as a local theater drama rather than putting it on the big screen. Total waste of time and money. The film had to be in production for a long time, and it would have been better to have left it that way. With superfluous sleep-inducing dialogues and sets, this is the worst movie I've encountered.
