The movie starts with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant struggles with the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of the whole movie. The rest of the movie is unfortunately cheesy, very unrealistic and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer ripoff. The end also sucks great time. Some moments like the scene where Gypsy and Helen (played by popular Chinese duo tapes Twins: Charlene & Gillian) are fighting over a stuffed teddy bear, is especially cringeworthy. The storylin is also paralyzed, probably they could have gotten something more scary than a book called "Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts though. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the movie patient with their comic roles. But the good bits just end there. Charlene & Gillian (from Twins) have never been able to act well and annoy you, and "the friendly but huge vampire" role was unfortunately given to Edison Chen, a talented beautiful boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
