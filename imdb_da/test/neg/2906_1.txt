This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I have seen such crap as Manos, Space Mutiny, and not, and I can honestly tell you that they are not holding a candle to Science Crazed. Science Crazed has no discirnable plot. Something about a guy who makes a woman pregnant via turkey bridge, and the child born * hours * later is fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, it's a newborn, it takes him an hour to kill people. The director runs continuously, and takes about fifteen minutes to create an awkward death. It is a page of dialogue for the whole movie, but the dialogue arrives in one minute after it has been spoken. <br /> <br /> Example Scene: The monster goes down a hall. We know this because there are about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet. In between loops we are treated to two women who train. Repeat ad nauseum for approx. 20 minutes. When the monster comes up, no one moves and everyone looks like deer in headlights, as the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them. At the level of the play you will guess that the people are already dead. I know my description doesn't seem so bad, but believe me, I can't fully describe the pain that is science crazed. <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott any video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
