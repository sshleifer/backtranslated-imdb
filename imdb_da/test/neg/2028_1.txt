The wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good thing that comes from this kind of nonsensical drive is that it looks like movies like this make the distribution make indy horror movie makers like me convinced that my upcoming feature will make the clip too. I think if this represents the market for indy horror, I could make a fortune video tape yourself to take the garbage for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of what this movie lacks would take too long to print. But the highlights are: no story, terrible action, horrible filmography and almost no editing. The last one disturbed me the most. As an editor himself, this movie drove me crazy because it almost didn't have any editing. Each scene was shot in a master. They had absolutely no cover at all. For anyone who does not ... "cover" shoots a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to create a desirable experience. Yes, this movie had none of it. I'm talking about even the simplest scenes. Example: An ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table typically starts with a master who establishes who is in the scene and where they are. So, as the conversation continues, you would cut back and forth to over-shoulder shots as the conversation continues. You can even throw a crooked shot or two of something on the table or in a person's hand. Anything. This is the "movie 101" thing guys. It seems that these people had no idea how movies work. Every shot was a camera lock-down. No movement, no cutting, nothing nothing. If I learned a course in filmmaking, it would be visual help for my "What not to do" lesson. In the end, do not waste your time crowds. The only amazing thing about this movie is that it has ever scored a breakdown. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
