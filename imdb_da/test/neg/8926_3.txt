Harlan Banks is the thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his wife and retire. But he decides to take a final routine in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately, someone speaks to the police, and after a hectic billiard, he only wins the slam to escape and avenge those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action party follows. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) Wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual bending aikido. Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first one I remember him with the grave is in 'The Foreigner'. It's not very impressive, but it gives a little insight into Seagal's deadly arsenal of bad grief. Or it covers the extra pounds he packs. However, look the way you choose. His main companion throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie), and they both uncover a small conspiracy of bad boys on both sides of the law and blame each evil actor. <br /> <br /> The movie's biggest problem is that it is painful and I mean really painful, unoriginal. Seagal only follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie, and even it gets increasingly boring as the movie progresses. Then it goes from boring to completely ridiculous in the final scene, as people who seemed to be dead suddenly kill each other, for no reason, start talking. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car hunt in Las Vegas complete with flip police cars and generally entertaining chaos, but after the brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10 <br /> Rating R: Constant violence and profanity
