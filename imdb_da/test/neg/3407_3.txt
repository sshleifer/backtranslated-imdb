I love to see a good gory giallo. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. It is long. Very long. The story is sticky and gives very little meaning even though it is very obvious. The scripture spends so much time on the killings and the girls, but it spends almost no time on the killer. This leaves a big hole in history: we may see a bunch of young women rushing together, but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to kill these girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we were still pretty much back in the dark, when, why did the [boring] killer decide it was worth going through the efforts to sacrifice them, and so naughty girls. It's all so good that I couldn't get into it a bit. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film's appearance, again, boring. Nothing memorable about it. The actors? Boring. The script? Laughably boring. The whole "brutal" love affair between the teacher, the blonde and the student was really embarrassing. What planet do they live on? The music? Boring. Skip it over.
