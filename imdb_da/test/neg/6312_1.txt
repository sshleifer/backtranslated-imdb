This movie has some of the worst actions I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was high school caliber. Although it is difficult to portray an off-the-wall character like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (though Ray Charles had more depth for his personality and musicality than Lewis ever dreamed of having). Phillips brothers portrayed Hazzard The Dukes, and Alec Baldwin plays Jimmy Swaggart a bit like Donald Duck, who performs Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a country preaching, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe in a single word. Wynona Ryders part was the best and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 when Lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later?) Some checking on the internet reveals that the essential facts that appear in the movie were true, at least no more fouled-up than most Hollywood bio pictures. This movie did badly at the box office and it should have.
