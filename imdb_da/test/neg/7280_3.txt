Notorious horror movies rarely measure up the hype that surrounds them, and I haven't yet encountered a worse offender than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. Having held back from seeing this for years, I was really happy when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my boyfriend was out to settle down and see it - knowing her extreme reluctance to do something that really was terrible. I didn't have to break. <br /> <br /> After a promising - if known - start that sets the film in the 'Desolution USA' world of survival fear, things break quickly when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the desolate wilderness. Just as it was shot on a $ 5 budget, with the cannibal clan costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specializes in faux caveman and Red Indian dress, the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic WASPs taking a detour a road trip to California to look for a silver memory in a nuclear test zone (!). When they break down, they become by the local family of carnivores and must fight to survive. <br /> <br /> While we hope for another Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn or Devil's Rejects, I actually understood I had stumbled upon something that should have been dusty and unnoticed in a backstreet video store's negotiating box. <br /> <br /> With gallon's tomato ketchup for blood and a few cruel wound close-ups, I can kind of see how an 18 certificate (in the UK) is justified, but with the close-ups that are trimmed, it wouldn't have looked out of place as a Saturday afternoon game at ITV. <br /> <br /> The entire silver mine / Nuclear test site subplot is just a McGuffin to justify "civilizing" the family against the primitives, but considering how easily the savages get their asses whether it extends credibility to believe that they had survived for a generation predecessor of passers-by. /> And then there is the end ... or lack of it. The Hills Har Eyes seems to lack either a third act or at least a satisfactory denouement. Instead, I just left wondering, "Yes and ...?"
