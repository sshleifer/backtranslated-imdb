Another direct to video movie from Disney, it is essentially perfect for the kids. The problem with Kronk's New Groove is that everything that made the first movie a fun big trip has been replaced by a more sad and bleak movie. In this film, Kronk teaches many lessons on many others' expenses. It takes a lot of time to create a more enjoyable movie. Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns to payback and a wife Birdwell hopes to defeat Kronk's rental consulting championship. It all leads to Kronk, who confronts his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life. From the Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronks re-uses the New Groove every single time it allows to entertain its viewers. If you loved the original, or look forward to the upcoming TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.
