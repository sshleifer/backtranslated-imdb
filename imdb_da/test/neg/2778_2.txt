Every time a movie has a dwarf or a midget in a prominent role, the odds of 10-to-1, which the director threw into him, are because he didn't know what to do more to keep the movie interesting. In this case, the characteristic little guy is not so bad - he manages to preserve his dignity for most of his scenes (except the part where he pulls the leading man down the stairs of the dungeon), but the film itself uses him as a dogs chew toys. <br /> <br /> The problem here is a joint with low budget utilization movies - there is a germ of a decent idea in here, but the director and scriptwriter don't know how to develop it. A good instructor would take the various story elements - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret laboratories and a dungeon, car crash, fist battles, bad monstrous Frankenstein style assistant, mind control, fraud and conspiracy, etc. And make an exciting one that involves movies full of cheap excitement and fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, there are a lot of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's laboratory, then a cheesy operation where the patient blurs tempura paint, followed by some of the same people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab more and more followed by another subset of the original group driving around and having an accident, followed by a dungeon scene, which is mainly about a woman putting her shoes back on, followed by a rooftop chase (herself the highlight of the film) followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from everybody else followed by a nice walk in the country, where everyone either chases, bumps, attacks or escapes from everyone else, followed by, Well, not much else. <br /> <br /> Somewhere here is a scary peroxide blonde dressed in white, a well-meaning heroic type that is well-presented, a three-foot lab assistant, a large lunk with a lot of molten rubber glued to it one side of his face, a child wondering in the middle of the film to give more of the "frankenstein factor", a brunette who, for example, falls in love with the hero without apparent reason, and the evil doctor himself, who should Be the luckiest man in the story of the evil super-villains, because nothing goes according to his plan, but it still goes out to him ... and everything because he remembered holding an electrode in the transplanted brain at some point in the operation. <br /> <br /> It was by no means the worst movie I've ever seen, or even the worst movie I've seen, or even the worst bad movie I've seen, but it's just there, oozing cheapness and Inattention to detail at any time and there is no real reason for even bad movie enthusiasts to see it.
