Probably one of the largest 100% of celluloid waste. It does not only suffer from a painful (and hugely predictable) disjointed script, but it is clearly a carbon copy of Alien II. Within five minutes I had correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). The special effects are ridiculous; There is a scene where a crew member is dissatisfied with two Krites that look like a pair of teddy bears, and the scant humor is wrong and horrible. There are better things to do with a video remote than using it to watch this movie.
