I loved the original, I see it every year. but the other is a piece of waste, and it should never have been done. The other could have worked if there was another location. The son was not an original or did not even work as one of Eddie's children. Third was too clever for Eddie, who cast down his father's role. None of the other children were in it. It could just have been much better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuity from the first movie. I will pretend that this does not even exist. It's boring that the actors didn't even think they were fooling. A really bad movie. I just think I wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and I really love all the national lampoon movies.
