Jack Frost returns with an army of Styrofoam balls that can only be foiled by being shot with super-soakers loaded with margaritas. How about a plot? The film hinges on such a ridiculous premise that it hardly raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with BBQ pliers and is impaled by carrots. You can even say that the whole movie is skating on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). Admittedly, there are some amazing one-liners, including a note on the Murderous Coconut Shark. <br /> <br /> Fair enough times are tough, but they do not apologize for the willingness of players to participate in such a complete trip. For those fans who hope to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept him as just a phallic carrot that creeps up the beach with corny voice-over comments.
