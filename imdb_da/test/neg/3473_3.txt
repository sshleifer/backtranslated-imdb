"Nero", as the film's title is in Germany, is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least attempted to show a more historically accurate Nero than the entertaining but totally fictitious Nero Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" It's still a big failure. And to the IMDb commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda are true, read a book on Nero published less than 20 years ago. Nero didn't burn Rome, this is proven! He didn't kill Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and meet for pleasure; he was the first emperor to ban the gladiatorial battle. The film still shows many errors, errors and, incidentally, is made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looked like some villas, the town itself looked like .. good as a cheap set. The action was between good and underpair, the music was almost insignificant, and the film was rapidly deteriorated after Nero became emperor of a hasty, poorly edited root without any clear narrative structure. So there is still the potential for an epic biography of Nero, showing the true Nero, one of the best emperors ruling Rome, despite Sueton et al.
