This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Unless you're in masochism, you'll never see it. It was an insufficiently long, meaningless, eye-catching, depressing movie and will forever come across my list of bad movies. The one who wrote this movie is a sadist. I almost shouted at the end, it was so bad it was. I want to give it zero stars, but since it is not an option, I give it one.
