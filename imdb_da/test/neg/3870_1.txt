The great Yul Brynner, who won an "Oscar" and starring "The Ten Commandments" among many others, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies like this, "Sartana" and so on. Sorry, yes. One should be ashamed to see him do his utmost to do this idiotic thing. Gone were the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, in 'The Magnificent Seven' and walked around under the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. It's hard to live by being an actor, sometimes.
