I'm very open-minded. I see all kinds of programs at last ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad. This show had the potential to be good. But my god, what were the authors, casting director, and instructor thinking? The actors are horrible ... with the slightest exception to Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) occasionally gets good lines with the best performance of the party. The rest of the cast kill the show. It is the same story line in each episode. Sam plans to do something. His boss interferes with these plans by awarding him ridiculous work projects. Then the stupid ways try Sam to accommodate both of them in a way that is primarily stupid and lacks any genuine intelligent humor. This is every episode. It becomes very tiring. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they ditch the eye like that. The 2 "hot" girls in the show are being printed (yet the brother remains? Explain to casting cut to me please). I can see why they wrote them out ... they had no significant role ... but they didn't add any better to replace them. <br /> <br /> The quirky Derek Tricolli character is being interpreted in season 2. His acting (along with everyone else's) looks like many poor sitcoms from the 80's ... could have been fun then ... but painful now . <br /> <br /> The show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had some talent to do them. This show lacks everything. Production quality is the only good aspect of the show. It's good in that respect ... unfortunately, the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My God. FOX, was there really nothing better to choose from? I'm sticking with shows like "It's always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" for now. The bar should be set by programs such as those that actually assume the audience is intelligent and do not continually throw themselves at using all their brain power to continue breathing.
