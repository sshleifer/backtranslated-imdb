I saw this after watching "Death Tunnel" (it is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life) so you can understand that I walked in and rolled my eyes slightly to see the instructors and producers of the cinematic pearl be responsible for this. First of all, I thought the director and the producer were the same guy. They are both Kid Rock meets Dawg the Bounty Hunter. I looked at the TAPS study, and I'm not skeptical - I think TAPS is the closest ever to a scientific method in the field. It was cold and trustworthy - I think they are haunted. <br /> <br /> But this, as the reviewer above, like taking a trip. Okay, a tour, fine, but the "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to earn a nice penny and get a financial investment on whether it is haunted or not, so when they have fantabulous stories, I have to take it with a pouring teaspoon of salt . <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, I could figure out what they wanted me to look at the picture about 50% of the time. The rest of the time I couldn't do anything. Also, without any connection to the pictures - the time of day, type of camera, humidity in the room, dust particles (which is 75% what is orbs), weather and other common factors, I cannot accept them. Nor can I think that some can be doctored. <br /> <br /> Why would the band keep the numbers from the door? Vandalism? Also during the TAPS study, they tried to dig the death certificates for these nurses - and they found only one who was ruled as "random" (people would not officially proclaim suicide). But when one of the guides mentioned this, he said "yep and that is suicide sign". It really seemed like the guides to the haunted houses here in October. However, I felt like interviewing the patients and the staff of the old hospital (s) who really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch. I am also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions and were not some ghoulish wardens. They weren't the best methods, but that was all they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
