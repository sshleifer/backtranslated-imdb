It may be for those who have been in summer camps, but it is certainly not an entertaining camp. I went to one before, but it didn't make me scream up and down for joy. Instead, it hurt my head. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray actually had some hair in the 70's. Yes, and he didn't mind driving any. But to get him to drive a lot, give him a woman to hunt for. It's not that some of the bouncers can't be fun. For example, joke runs with one of the councilors, who always wake up somewhere else because of the movement of his bed. Instead, it is that the jokes and stumbling blocks were poorly set up and executed. It just hasn't been fun. <br /> <br /> For anyone who loves comedy, it's a pain. Others are glued to it for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it doesn't come close. "F"
