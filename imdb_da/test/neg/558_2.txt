I had avoided this movie for sometime ... because I considered it an unnecessary installment for a series that should only have had 2 parts. But after reading some pretty favorable reviews ... from some IMDB watchers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it from my local video store. Should I move on ... when I say .... this was a buck-50 lost. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. Firstly .... I realize no one wanted to see a 33-year-old Macchio in this movie ..... But why couldn't they have read Miyagi a letter or something from Daniel-san ... maybe explaining what happened to Daniel ... hell, they could at least have made a quick mention of Daniel or something. But no ... and to compress the already bad manuscript .... they added the stupid monks ... I thought monks took a silence promise ... guess that these yapping monks don't take their promises seriously ... hehehe. The training the girl went through in the movie was quick and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young males .... was a confusing concept to say the least .... it was far from even being a martial arts movie. .. with the girl fighting only short in the last scene .... and then she did not even come close to being hit herself once ... by the male fighting her .... give me a break ... she would have been hit at least once .... I suppose the authors and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl being beaten by a man in this. I could go on and on again ... but essentially ... I stop saying that this movie was just so bad .... even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even watch (she was sorta "butch" looks) .... I can only think of a handful of movies I've been through ... comparing to just how bad this flick was ..... DON "T AFFALL YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE .. ........
