I saw this at my local supermarket and I knew Debra was in it so I decided to buy it (out of support for the sexy woman!) The reason and action of this movie was horrible (except for Debra Wilson, and I'm not just saying this because I love her, she was seriously the only actor or actress who had feelings in their acting and voice!) What I didn't get at the beginning is why the wife didn't just come back in her car instead of to run randomly like that. It was so stupid. And it's LA (Someone saw her being abducted on a public street - NO ... yes it's realistic!) Also in the park when Charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for a stupid reason) the hell was bent on finding him (and at some point) when they did, they had him in a rifle - over a CELL PHONE! In fact, I doubt that LAPD would go out of their way as a stupid mobile phone! The lady could have gone up to one of many of these mobile cabins and have it replaced! The kids who trade skills are also sucked (I think they read from a cue card or had any of the camera whisper their lines) because they would be asked questions and would look around and then respond to a questionable voice (ie "yes do i miss dad?") Also how could all these snipers be in the trees and on building rooftops in LA without being seen?! I see this being played at. 3 in the United States. <br /> <br /> Debra Wilson fanatics will enjoy her parts. She is the only actor with real acting (Debra, treasure - stop making those cheap D-classes, direct to video ... maybe it will change with the upcoming movie Whitepaddy.) She puts some jokes in there when one of Her supervisor comes up and asks her who she is talking to, she shouts at her computer and goes "Damnit, Charlie!") I gave it a 4/10 ... a 4 only because of Debras good acting skills.
