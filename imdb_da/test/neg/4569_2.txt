I am generally not a fan of high school comedies, they are heavily dependent on humor in bad taste and rarely removed from klich√©d history lines and characters and even boring dialogue. However, I have had my share of guilty pleasures, especially when I was still in high school myself. Seeing the oh-so recognizable teacher figures getting their kicks kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instant sympathetic, it was not the case in 'Cheats', especially not the main character. Of course, it didn't help that the actor in games was one of the most annoying, no talented, arrogant children I've ever seen in a comedy. In order to shop in a comedy there is no joke, it's hard to be fun: The delivery just needs to be right or the material wastes. In this case, there were not very good things to begin with, and the jokes, which were half fun, were screwed up professionally by the casting. <br /> <br /> This movie felt 3 hours long, the director had never heard of pacing of course. Stay away from this, there are many other fun teenage comedies out there like 10 things I hate about you, who is your father and super bath.
