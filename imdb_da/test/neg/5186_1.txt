After watching this movie I was surprised that someone was fine !!!! I think it's the worst comedy I've ever seen .... ever !!!! If you think you already saw the worst comedy, wait to see this crap !!!! Not fun (OK, one or two laughs maybe ....... but you have to be really tall), the play is terrible, and the story doesn't exist. Although you like snowboarding (and I really do) you will hate this movie. OK, OK, you can see some great kids, some nice snowboard tricks and some beautiful mountains, but that's all !!! Watch a porn in the mountains instead of the play and the story can be better !!!!! Sometimes in IMDb I read bad review about some movies and at the end they are not so terrible .... but this one, believe me, is pure garbage !!!! Don't waste your time and money in this.
