Similarly, Lamberto Bava was a substandard facsimilie of his father, Mario (who was an extremely overrated instructor anyway), Michele Soavi is a substandard director of Dario Argento mold. The "Church" has at least one thing to recommend it - the incredibly detailed art direction - but absolutely nothing else. The film is long-lasting, filled with one-dimensional characters, and almost put me to bed several times. There is a fine line between 'art' and 'pretentious crap', and while the 'Church' is not completely worthless, you would rather see something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
