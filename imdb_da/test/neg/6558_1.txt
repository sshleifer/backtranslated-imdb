Welcome to Plan 9 from the outer space of Star Trek movie. Come on, draw, admit it. This movie is so bad, so incredibly unfortunate in every department, it has become something of a classic. Shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid. "BOONES! Hi, Bones" brilliant! This is not just ham - there are several great pigs in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. Must be in accordance with the Trade Protection Act for the use of such an expression. The company is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show was better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yes, Spock sings Row Row Row your boat. After fighting over the meaning of the words !!!! "Capt. Life is not a dream." Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really choke Shatner for this. Couldn't Shat have given us his rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man, or harmonized with Nimoy at Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Very disappointed. <br /> <br /> A Sean Connery look-a-like player spock half brother. Only because they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! It would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989 it looks like watching your full granny immerse in a Christmas party. Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's Back! Shat twirls her about a couple of times as a WWF Wrestler and chokes her away. Yayy The Shat! Seems Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan revolt. This explains why Spock has not previously mentioned him in 79 episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently mercifully killed his father, but left them a reason. Tell me it is not hysterical fun. <br /> <br /> 11 tires Enterprise suddenly grows an additional 400 tires for a flight sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's anti-gravity boots also support Bones and The Shat superbly. Must also have used em on the vaulted whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what is supposed to be God, but I assume is really a kind of alien being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in the 10 bids. Sean Connery the 2nd calls on God to share his pain and die immediately. Or something. God punishes Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I want to know what Jehovah's Witnesses have done about this scene. Shat, who has killed God, immediately goes back to his song song with Spock and Bones. Overall, row rows your boat .....
