I absolutely couldn't believe the levels of tenure on the display in this production. I honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. I know. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame is not with the cast, but let's get them out of the way first ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best bet in the cast). He had a good, clear theater-style voice. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges' voice was uneven, but he had a free expression in each issue. The rest could not keep a note in a bucket, even though the music was, of course, called in after that fact. Must have been really awful to hear them live. They were also all girly-boys except maybe three. If I wanted to see naked women on stage, I could go to the titty bars. Not sure why anyone would choose to film the L.A. production instead of New York. I could imagine that NY has more accessible song talent, even if one would believe in L.A. they would be able to find better-LOOKING guys. Apparently not. <br /> <br /> But I downgrade ... the real fault here lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal, spooky trip I have ever heard. It sounded like some theatrical cools took all their musical CDs, threw them in a blender and poured goo on one side. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theater writing and whatever it is. I mean seriously, I laughed my ass through it all, but not on the lame jokes. I think the morbid 'my-love-have-died-of-aids song' titled 'Kris, see what you've missed' was the most hysterical thing of the whole show. Genius writes ... Crisis / Missed ... wow ... the almost rhyme ... must be a good lyric. And Jesus ... the end of the song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." ABOVE AND ABOVE !!! My other favorite was "You Must Be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was filled with the most arbitrary text just because they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said, "He's not that big, I can do it" ... as evidenced by the delayed "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" reference from COMPANY in a song. Another Iraq: Why is 20-somethings song about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously comes from the lyricists' mouth and not the actors ... again, bad to write. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain, and I know many of you, make strange fetishes, go ahead and see it. But you have been warned.
