The most impressive thing about 'Anemic Cinema' is its title: an anagram that is almost also a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English, as it is spelled differently in Britain. <br /> <br /> I've always found dilettant Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he accidentally invented and which is only photocopies with direct contact), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But it certainly had to happen in the end, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> In the early 1960s, the second season of 'The Twilight Zone' began each episode with a shot of turning black and white concentric circles. There is an image in 'Anemic Cinema' that is so similar, I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed it from this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a black and white spiral. In fact, if there were ever any movies that deserve to be described as a spiral, this is it. Through 'Anemic Cinema' we are treated (?) For shot by a rotating disc containing words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is vertiginous, and the texts - about incest and eskimos - are almost Dada in their meaningless. I laughed at a smart sexual proverb. The emperor is naked, folks, and this movie is as little as 2 points out of 10. Au suivant!
