'Mix' is probably the word I want to use to try to describe this movie. I only looked at it because it had a good rating here and I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is about racism in a post 9/11 America, and the director hit it with a sledge hammer! There was no subtlety at all in the movie, and it felt as if they were trying to get some sort of Magnolia feeling of the movie - which is never a good idea when the movie was three hours of tedium and confusion, for it to start calculating frogs in the end ... All in all, a big disappointment.
