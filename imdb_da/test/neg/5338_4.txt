Oh, I'm really tired of all these generic Japanese horror movies about long-haired female ghosts and ghost children. "Ghost Train" is no exception. It is clearly influenced by "Ringu", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago I was into such modern ghost stories because they usually managed to give me some goosebumps, unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in "Ghost Train". In fact, the movie is really boring. Noriko lacks in a subway tunnel as a primary school classmate-Nana will investigate a mystery of several disappearances using a youth conductor and another "lost" mother's mother. The movie offers some mildly scary moments, but the CGI effects are ridiculous and the climax is illogical. Push it.
