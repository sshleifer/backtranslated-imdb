Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage should be the first word in connection with all of its opus. Movie. Theater. Music. Repentance, artistic, cultural, personal. An inheritance with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. He introduced neo-realism through the work of an American novelist James Cain in "Ossesione". He gave Anna Magnani the most exceptionally beautiful close-ups of his career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work rests on a particular Adam Low's talents and Helmut Berger's voice. What a terrible fate. For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary by Director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) entitled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It is out on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment
