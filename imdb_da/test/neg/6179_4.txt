As far as I am gathering, this episode tries to make a statement about how real villains are very bad people, and it's as scary as the paranormal. The "paranormal" imagery associated with the villain Donnie is purely symbolic. He is actually just a normal human being. <br /> <br /> The problem is, I just don't buy it. Donnie is simply not scary than the paranormal. He's not even scary at all. As a guy who seems confused and strange rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has just recently become a killer, he is significantly less disturbing than most known serial killers in fact (eg: he is like a lot of water down version of Ed Gein). That's why Scully's horror of seeing anything other than carcasses with hair and nails cut off (something that is no different from a normal personal hygiene routine) before anyone has been killed or injured at all is completely out of character. She sees things a hundred times worse in almost all other episodes and hardly any flinches. <br /> <br /> As the Comic Book Guy says ... "worst episode ever!"
