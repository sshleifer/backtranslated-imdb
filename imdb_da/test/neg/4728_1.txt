This is not the true story. It is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events. It supports suicide, morosobsession with death, a completely free side shed of organized religion in general (and especially the Anglican Church) and generally provides a nihilistic, meaningless worldview, of which movie footage I suppose is meant to go away, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Except the garbage bin, though beautifully done by a standby. However, the fact that anyone would suggest that this is a true representation is very false advertising. Do you want the right story? Rent 'Fairy Tale'. It's the real story. See if you can find a correspondence between the facts presented in both cases. I only found one: the girls who made the original photographs were pre-pubescent.
