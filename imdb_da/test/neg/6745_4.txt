I'm talking badly about G.I.J.T.M. mostly because I think it lacked something like G.I. Joe had. Yes, it had something like G.I. Joe didn't have the celebrity cameos of Don Johnson, and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The Movie lacked the passion for the characters that G.I. Joe the TV series had. Most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead, and they had to die every time now. It's a good movie, but I didn't want to say it was the biggest movie in the world I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built on, I would say that Serpentor striking Duke in the chest was not the best way for Charlie Adler's character to go out. Nor was it to see Golobulus remind Cobra Commander why he was elected to lead the Cobra forces and then be terribly mutated after he could not deliver what Cobra-La felt was rightfully theirs. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the best way for the GI Joe series to go out, but it's better than nothing. :)
