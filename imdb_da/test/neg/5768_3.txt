The story is a ticked jubilee jumper made a deal with the devil to find gold and is forced to protect it forever. A bunch of friends find the gold and are spoken by the old miner, and they are forced to blow the gold to the smiths to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how did this movie not win the Oscar for the film of the year? What a compelling story of the late 20-year-olds running from a collar jumper right out of the 19th century. I love how in other movies you can't kill the monster, but they can knock it out ... this movie they write the monster as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie clearly frightens Nightmare on Elm Street part 4, but what the hell, not that movie was a 5-star classic either. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is when we are introduced to a girl who has never been to school, never been out of town, never learned to read or write .... but speaks perfect English, smokes hot and carries the latest fashion. How did the Oscar miss it? <br /> <br /> OK I'm done with the bad jokes, this movie is pure crap and only see it if you have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are already in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
