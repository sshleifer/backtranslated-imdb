I had never heard of "The Clearing" until I really bored a day with some friends in the local Blockbuster and it grabbed our attention. The description on the DVD jacket took our interest, but when we popped it into the DVD player, the boredom began first. <br /> <br /> The story was pulled out for waaaay too long. It seemed to follow the same disposition as other films that include a kidnapping. However, the most exciting parts were at the beginning of the film. After that, the overview was followed exactly and that made "The Clearing" unoriginal. The feedback was too many in number, and the sacrifice of grief gave nothing interesting or reinforced the film's character. And I also found that I didn't like the end, so it probably meant that I didn't like the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The play wasn't terrible ... it wasn't the biggest. Robert Redford has provided much better performances. Willem Dafoe's tragic character was the only one that I really developed through history, and the viewer sees only that change in the last ten minutes in the film. Helen Mirren's depiction as Robert Redford's wife was flat and followed the same generic mold as other films that include a tragic and heartbreaking event. In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing to rave about. Use your movie rental money on something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
