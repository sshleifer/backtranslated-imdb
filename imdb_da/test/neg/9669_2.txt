A bad bad movie ... horrible plot, hinges on Bolo Yeung's charater, but he speaks maybe 20 words throughout the movie and has only one battle scene - still in good shape, when he was also in the Kung Fu classic "Enter The Dragon" Interesting to see William Zabka ("Johnny" from The Karate Kid) in another martial arts role.
