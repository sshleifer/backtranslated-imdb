This movie is horrible, I can't even be bothered to write a review on this waste! All I want to say is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the play is very bad. The boy who plays the protagonist really annoys me, he has the same expression on his face through the movie. I just want to slam him! Basically, 80% of the movie is slow motion shot of skateboarders, weird music and complete sh * t. Apparently, I have to write at least 10 lines of text to submit this comment so I use a few lines to say that the main character has one of those faces you just want to slam! <br /> <br /> Meh, I give up .. THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!!!
