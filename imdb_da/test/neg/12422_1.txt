Legendary pop star Steve Alaimo ("Don't let the sun catch you") stars like an unlikely racer whose career has hit the skis (ha ha) because he constantly crashes his car (or as he paralyzes "I" I'm tired of falling down at every fat loss coming behind the wheel "). He falls into a bad crowd of humorous scary Nazi cyclists, unlikely named Jeeter, Banjo, Fats and Linda. Fat is the most comfortable of the pile; he took a surfboard to the bottom of the skull and now communicates only through grunts, a kind of Harley Davidson Leatherface. <br /> <br /> In any case, Steve is being fooled by the police to catch the killed villains in the middle of one of their bank robberies. for "kick, man." I guess they are giving the money to charity. Steve is constantly failing, the cyclists are getting more beautiful and it never comes out as daring because it's so boring. This movie looks like it was filmed through a greasy p not since "Necromantic" has a movie so my soul trampled. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Fats continued to control "Deranged", Ed Gein biopic with Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in summary: Wild Rebels: Hilarious on MST3K, terribly everywhere else.
