I write this note as a chess player as well as a movie viewer. I watched the Kasparov-Deep Blue games in 1997 on the internet. I know something about the issues raised. Other chess players will come together and would like to know if this movie is worth seeing / buying, and I am pretty much talking to them. However, I am not trying to ignore those who are not "chess". <br /> <br /> This movie is about the 1997 fight between Garry Kasparov and the custom computer "Deep Blue". However, the first picture you see in the movie is not by Kasparov or by the computer, but by "THE TURK". This is a "slot machine" built in Europe at the 18th century tournament and played winning chess against anyone coming. I put the word "automaton" in quotes because it was like everyone now knows a fake. There was a man inside it. <br /> <br /> If you don't like watching "THE TURK" then you won't be able to stand in the movie because "THE TURK" has so much screen time as Kasparov, perhaps more, in both modern recordings and ib / w footage from some old movies. The time limit of "TURKEN" every few seconds emphasizes Kasparov's responsibility that "Deep Blue" had human assistance - to some extent it was a fake computer that IBM cheated that there was "a man in it" working behind that scenes to help it win. Kasparov doesn't just think this, but the filmmakers also think so. And then it's not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers. It's a propaganda piece about a big company that allegedly abuses a helpless grandmaster. Really, it is much like a "negative campaign ad", as it is chock full of eerie music and evocative camera work and eerie sound effects and innuendos ("we never found out what was behind the locked door") and it always present " TURK ". <br /> <br /> Now, most people in the chess community are quite convinced that IBM is not cheating and that this was Garry's paranoia at work. Initially, for a human being to help "Deep Blue" hit Kasparov, it would seem that you would need a person who was better than "Deep Blue" AND better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea is a little suspicious from the start. In addition, at the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your PC that could beat strong grandmasters. Today, much more than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect. And we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer hit a guy in check. (And basically, Kasparov is beaten with two bad mistakes, including finishing game 2 in a drawn position.) <br /> <br /> In fact, you don't see much of them in chess games. There are a few comments from masters and commentators who briefly explain how they went, but in reality, you don't see any of the strategy or tactics at all. Of course, as a chess player, I take this as a big defect, but I also think that non-players are being cheated. For example, imagine. A baseball movie where you can't see anything of the game - just a commentator telling you that "in Game Four, the White Sox defeated Astros with such and such a score." No one wanted to make a movie like that. But here, for example, we are told that Kasparov made a bad blunder in opening the crucial game 6, but we are not shown the position on the screen or told why it was a blunder or what he should have done instead or something . We only see a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (When I saw this on DVD, let me warn chess players about the DVD as well. The jacket promises that Extras includes the games "with analysis." Is this grandmaster analysis what people like us can find interesting NO! It is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from a version of Chessmaster that tells you when a piece is attacked and a farmer is isolated and that you are in "Caro-Kann Defense, Main Line." Blahhhh. ) <br /> Someone might come together and say, "Well, this movie is meant to dramatize the fight for the non-player, and then it is unfair to be impatient with it." Nor does it do a very good job of reaching out to the non-player - it changes over some points that a real beginner really would have explained. For example, it says that Kasparov might have got "eternal control" in the second game, but that doesn't explain what it is (or show what it would have looked like on the table, which would have been interesting). It flashes back to the Kasparov-Karpov matches, but does not explain why there were two of them, or who organized them, etc. I did not need this information myself, but I am aware of it. If you don't already have chess experience, there are places where you get confused and it's just a mistake in the movie. In the end, I cannot recommend the movie, which, like "THE TURK" in itself, is not what is said to be (a documentary), but more of a stage light.
