fantasy must slip Jim Wynorski's mind when he wrote the manuscript to it. I don't mind when the animal's scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat lines from other movies, it goes a little too far. I enjoyed watching Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert be eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie, but her breasts (my men's feelings). Jerri Manthey should remain on the survival island, her acting is stiff, incredible, and she's just a clean drill. liked the scene where cobra comes out of the sea eats the guy then for extra taste destroys the ribbon. At least we know the next plot, giant snake man beats komodo before they become the father of a nest egg. Jerri would be great as a parent. sit back with a 6 pact or a few links. It will ease the pain.
