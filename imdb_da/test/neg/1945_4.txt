WARNING!! This review may include spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. It says all this junk about children who tell ghost stories as they do, but then it means that they will all be killed by some murderers in the forest. This does not happen. The stories they tell are a bit interesting, especially the one with the dog and everything that licks, but most are pretty boring, monsters in the forest, a dumb girl and the biggest, the whole movie.
