If you are not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, then it is a round trip: They are a couple of film producers and finaciers from Israel who established the gun film company in the early 1980s. The only Israeli to get a worse press than these two was Menachim Begin. Beginning probably deserved the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a god send to filmmakers, because no matter how bad your script was, they were fortunately funded your movie and would usually hire directors who couldn't directly and actors who couldn't act. In fact, you often have the impression that people would just go up to Yoram and Menahem ask them for some money and they commit without seeing the resume of the film producer. If only producers today were so confident. The young governors are not a cannon film, but Globus and Golan funded it, and it has their signature all over. It is badly directed, badly acted, poorly edited, but it is the script that jumps out and attacks you with its terrible. It starts with a bunch of high school jocks getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks. In fact, the first 20 minutes of the movie play like a sex comedy, and it's a shock when the young warriors become a vigilant movie. But it's not just any kind of vigilant movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (Note a connection? They are both followers and they are both vigilant films made by Cannon movies), no master, it's a ridiculously bad vigilante movie About beautiful boy high school jocks and their poodle goes on mission to wipe out scumbags. This film proves that Globus and Golan gave money to people regardless of their film-making abilities, and you have to worry about people who seem to use their entire reserves to make movies all around vigilantes
