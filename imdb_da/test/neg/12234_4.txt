First movie comment ever! I start by saying "Come on! Wasn't that bad ... was it?" ... No it wasn't that bad actually. I laughed and giggled enough times through the film, so I can't say with my hand on my heart that it was nonsense. It's completely different, this and Epic Movie (Epic Movie sucked bad .. doh!). "How?" people would ask. I tell you how. This movie is not as near as pointless, not to mention the stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes fun) things happening around and with the characters are actually fun in this movie. Not the best around but hey ... what would you expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I find out that when you write a comment, you have to be more objective (my own opinion), but yes, of course it was stupid, it's a "stupid" movie! See, I'm not telling you to go see the movie now or else you missed the century's event. What I tell you is that if you happen to see the movie somewhere, don't cut your eyes on the opening credits. See what it's about - who knows, you like a little. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
