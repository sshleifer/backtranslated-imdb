First of all, let me say that those of you who voted "10" just enter yourselves and try to get the voices to a respectable level ... something that this movie does not deserve. (The only movies that deserve a 10 IMO are the classics ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. Look at the best movie films all the time for the complete list.) I also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote to be so realistic as far as it is like in a hole. Although I would agree with them on the surroundings, they simply do not consider the film as a whole ... they are horrified by the surroundings, but miss the overall review. It would be like I voted 10 for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think beach scenes remind me how it is in the Florida Keys ... even though it may be true, it doesn't deserve the movie to get a 10 because the movie as a whole was crazy. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you something was hiding this movie, as usual, if one thing stinks in a horror trick, something else fetches or makes up for the weakness. (Ex. - Bad actors are overshadowed by a large plot and / or large camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD and it all started quite normal. We began to wonder who would be the first to die ... after a short drive and hiking they camped for the night. At that moment, I recorded some things that really made me tune the rest of the movie. Two main problems I had: Bad effects and an even worse story line. The first thing we all noticed was that the campfires were not real ... you can clearly see "cgi" or false flames as they were all on. For a horror movie having such a blatant effect should have told me what I was in the next hour. <br /> <br /> Only a few minutes later I was shown how poorly written this movie was. I can't remember exactly how they arrived at that point, but we find that "token Nerd" writes a book about exploring caves etc. Another guy in the group will tell a story about an experience, but hesitate to say "I don't want this story in your book." The author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (A direct quote: "If I tell the story, you will definitely have it in your book.") At this time, I expect a nice 5+ minute story, complete with flashbacks and heartfelt appearances. What I got was a brief, poorly explained (and acted) statement. I say statements because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I can't remember the exact quotes, but basically he says, "We were in a cave, the cave flooded, a girl died as our friend saw she was drowned." You may think I'm over exaggerated and really critical, but it's not far from a direct quote, line for line, from the movie scene. Over the next 50 minutes or so of movies taking place in the cave, and although the lighting is what I could imagine being in a hole, I could really have done it without the right fuzzy / lazy look at the movie and the camera shaken is only one that I did not go after. (I have really good vision, and after seeing the film's main parts, I felt legally blind.) I was emotionally detached from this movie, and the parts that should probably have been scary were not. Maybe I had been able to overlook the very slow and badly acted start of this movie, at least I would have been scared, but I can't remember anyone in the dark room, even by shrugging on " action "scenes. /> <br /> The last scene was probably one I will never forget, and that is not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped in a room that is naked. The "monster" comes in to attack / kill the women ... he's stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. A return takes place where we find that the "monster" was wounded as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave. Cut back to the present time and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a shirt screen). He looks at the picture, and the two women seem to have found the weakness of the caves / soft spot. At that time, he sticks and kills a girl and then continues to rape the other woman, rather graphic. After about 30 seconds watching the camera jiggle and shaking when he raped her, the credits roll over, the movie's over. Honestly, if I had to do it all and I wasted money on renting this movie, I could have saved myself one hour and see the first scene and last scene in this movie and still with the same thoughts about what I have now. Those of you comparing this with Blair Witch are the way off ... if any of you had read about how the director and author ran the movie of Blair would realize how revolutionary it was ... leaving each cast member a script day / night filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor did is genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb wanted to let me down, it would get a negative score ... I don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
