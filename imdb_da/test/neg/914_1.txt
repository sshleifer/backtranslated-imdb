oh dear god, i have a little to see the movie four times in my sister's house and it was terribly a story of sex and weapons and very cheap inexplicable plays, unless you are being told to see this avoid what yes Rule turned out just that he can't act Ving Rhames also gave the most horrible spectacle ever in any of his films. There wasn't a part of this movie made me laugh or make me jump or feel any sense. I would be surprised that people actually enjoyed it. I think some horrible movies in my life but it would be in my five worst movies ever the music was not good, and the story I think was made by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and sat down ten bullet points and made It to a movie absolutely horrible
