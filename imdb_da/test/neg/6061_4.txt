My guess would be that this would initially be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, otherwise you could explain its confused, abbreviated history. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The film feels as though participating in plot points was dropped to squeeze it into its time slot. <br /> <br /> If it was longer, it could be more sensible, but it would still not be very good. The film's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as a war between male and female, but the film loses the ball on this, making Hera's followers quite awful while they are not aware of what Zeus supporters do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So it has a couple of exciting ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful to them. <br /> <br /> Poor dialogue, cardboard characters and an interesting scene involve Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unwatchable but also not worth seeing.
