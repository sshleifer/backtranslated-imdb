And parading around a 14-year-old girl in a swimsuit is one of them. For fans of this movie, I would like to ask: Do you allow your daughter to walk around a resort dressed like this? And will your 14-year-old be able to handle the reaction she would get from men? If so, I would like to know why, both count. A suit such is a clear invitation to men; It is hypocritical to suggest that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> And at another time, which teenage girl would ever claim that her father was her lover without excuse for serious psychological problems? It's almost as disgusting as the bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Put simply, some things are just not fun or appropriate, and they will never be.
