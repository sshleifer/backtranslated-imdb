Now I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that Zombie movies are usually not so good, but I like them anyway. Despite the crappy plays and worthless dialogues that occur in almost every Zombie movie, this is by far the worst. See, there are a few basic rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Tactics are rarely used and NEVER act as a boxer. They do not escape a blow to their heads, they take it with a nasty smile. They're not trying to hit you, they grab their arm and bite it! 2. Zombies can't speak. Only in the dead died. Otherwise they do not speak. 3. You do not fight zombies with nearby weapons. You lose in a melee battle against zombies. Firearms are used. In this movie, however, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> It had no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> To watch a zombie movie, see one with an average score higher than 3 on IMDb.com
