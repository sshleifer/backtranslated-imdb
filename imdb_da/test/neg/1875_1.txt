Stripes, an army training room comedy with Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a favorite of mine. Meatballs, a summer 'romp' camp with Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a complete waste of time. It takes a lot of effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word 'comedy' transforms a work of joy aforethought) as obscure, anemic and boring like this. <br /> <br /> Murray apparently reached the same conclusion during recording, but his usual reliable improvisation moves away from him, and his flailing attempt to inject life into cases simply adds to embarrassment - "It really doesn't matter" to chanting the scene is scary. It doesn't help that the support noise is deprived of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then meatballs were made in 1979. ("And introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy" announces the opening credits. No, not Chris Makepeace?!). Reitman has mercifully corrected his mistake two years later for Stripes. Murray's shtick is so much more fun when he fools around with John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Ditch this and see it.
