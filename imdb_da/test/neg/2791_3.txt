The movie starts when we see a recording of a big drought back in the 30s in America. Then, a brief story of an eerie looking farmer Elija, who made an agreement with Satan to get a good harvest, appears. Elijah hired young men to work in his garden, killed them and used them as scarecrows. He also fed the earth with their blood. Some time after 2 police come to visit him. One of them is shot by Elija, another kills the farmer himself ... Then the present is shown, and a guy named Sean tells that he has an old farm left as an inheritance. He decides to go there with some friends to see what happens. Little did Sean know that the next night is "Payback Night" ..... <br /> <br /> For me, this movie had a good story for a horror flip, but low budget and bad special effects just ruined it. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of lazy film making. For example, we see a scarecrow (a usual guy wearing a fun, cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see a normal human skin under his glove, instead of some rotting meat. Gore is not that impressive. There are some unpleasant killings of our "lovely" scarecrowers, but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, the play is something OK in this flick, or I say better its credible. Some naked scenes are also presented to the fans (even a lesbian scene), but these scenes do not store it. Rating: Good music, good story, solid play. But horrible effects, cheap gore and plot holes lower this movie. Not really recommended.
