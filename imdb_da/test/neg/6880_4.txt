I wouldn't even call this a good movie, it can actually be a bad one. <br /> <br /> But there are at least 2 good reasons to keep an eye on this movie, it's the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), both of which deliver solid performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better so the rest of the player is pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in "Suburban kids goes to the hood" drama HAVOC, but here she is far from good on the edge to be annoying. <br /> <br /> The story is decent enough, though nothing special, but it would have been much better as it happens in LOUSIANNA that one of the kids actually has a southern accent, but they don't (! ). <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie where the "Monster" is actually delineated so deeply into Lousianna folk music, with voodoo and so it's just plain stupidity not to include this accent in the characters. The one and only thing that makes it so rap METHOD MAN, he plays vice-turner and accentuates quite a few in his few scenes, and I think if a rapper can do this, why should the "professional" actors not be capable to do the same? Mister Tical aka Meth is very pleasant in its very small role, who at the ticallion stallion ever be a policeman? Although it is only on the big screen. At least besides that, it's a pretty stupid but rather enjoyable Slasher movie, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young cast, it could have been really bad, luckily they are good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent, but there are hundreds of better slasher movies out there.
