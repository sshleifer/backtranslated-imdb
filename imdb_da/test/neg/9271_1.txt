Cates is unconcerned and convincing, Kline takes over as always, like Lithgow as he strikes an English accent (at least he assumes what he is trying to do), and the tone bar uncomfortably between farcical and maudlin. As with most pet projects exhibiting a celebrity couple, this is a relief when this creepy piece laughs until it's forced and crushing conclusion.
