I am tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this program "Gilmore Girls". It confused me, because I just couldn't put my finger on what it was about. Was it about a young woman who had a baby young in life and never grew up? Was it that the daughter was more responsible than her mother? Was it about a rebellious rich girl and her not rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally I didn't care. The cast makes me scream. Scripture is neither "smart" or "intelligent", it is syrup and boring. <br /> <br /> So why did I see? Because I heard so many good things about this, and I am not one to vote a sentence until I have seen. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I saw a few times. The first time I saw this I saw the mother around as if she were 12, and the daughter acted as if she was 40. Maybe that's not attracting me. I have never seen any of the films "Freaky Friday" - not to say it is, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend looking at this show every week. So I asked her, "What is this about?" A very bright young lady, usually articulated, could never give me a right answer. So I asked others who rob over it - they don't know either. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls turns out to be a television program that is like an "art house movie". Many of us won't get it, but those who go try desperately to find an opinion where there really isn't one just to be "hip". Yes, I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying - whine, whine, nasally WHINE. An entire hour of it. Wow. And the rest of the casting is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese ribbon. The city is hokey, the men are wimps, the big parents are boring, and unfortunately I find nothing to solve about any of these characters or worry about anything they do. It's like watching paint dry on the wall.
