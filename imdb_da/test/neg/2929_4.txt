From Kiarostami, this art house visual and acoustic exhibition is a surprise. For a director known for his stories and keen observation of people, especially children, this excursion speaks to minimalist filmography for questions: Why did he do so? Was it keeping him busy during a seaside vacation? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 Long Takes" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes. They are (title names are my own and times approximate): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and waves". The camera is almost still standing on a small piece of driftwood as it is moved around by small waves spraying on a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "See people on the seafront". The camera is still standing and looking at the ocean horizon and a beach promenade. People go over the camera's frame, their faces too far and blurred to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs at the water's edge". The camera is still standing and looking at the horizon of the sea with a sandy beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge, six dogs do not do much, just relax. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in line, gaggle of ducks". The camera is still standing and looking at the horizon of the sea near the water's edge. Thousand and dozen ducks flow in a single file from left to right. I suppose Kiarostami gradually released them. The last two ducks stop dead on their tracks, and suddenly a rock of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume that Kiarostami has collected the ducks and reissued all at the same time. It is not the first time that he deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera is standing over a pond at night. It is tone-white, except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and clouds run to cover the moon. The screen turns dark. What is left for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and finally the morning green. Turned me upside down if this was done in a single roof. I saw this segment as a healthy composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. 24 minutes! <br /> <br /> Apart from the mildly funny ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me cold. A nonessential movie to Kiarostami admirers. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd rate "Five" a five, but four is what it deserves. <br /> <br /> The movie is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
