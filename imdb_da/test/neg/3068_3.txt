Recognizing the picture of the dinner on the DVD's cover made me realize that this was a local movie. The word Detroit in the title portrayed my suspicions, and I saw some things up and yes, a local movie was. <br /> <br /> So I picked it up. Someone I knew actually knew that some of the producers / instructors (not remember which ones) and said the producers / directors made people pay to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! What a good idea. The filmmakers get capital to make the movie, thanks to their cast and crew. Then the investors (cast, crew, others) get some of the profits I imagine. <br /> <br /> Profits! <br /> <br /> Anyways. This movie completely underestimated me. Special effects were special as in special children driving the small buses to school. The action was very entertaining, but not on purpose. There's a good line where a guy says "good", this bone won't smoke itself! "like a pickup line. Unfortunately, it's the only fun part of the whole movie. The story? Well, I've been following it about 3/5 of the way in, so everything stopped sensibly and when we sat there and watched it, it ended Suddenly, I mean as in ... no solution to anything, just as they ran out of time. "Sorry people out of time, good night!" <br /> <br /> We sat there baffled and booing and threw in Another movie, so about 20 minutes later, my neighbor showed up with one of the guys from the movie, we threw it back and he (the actor) gave us a continuous comment that was great because he completely cracked the movie ! <br /> <br /> What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle chase scene where it was so dark that it could have been a guy It ran past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all, it and the jaw falling in your face suddenly end is enough to make you shine. In pain! The zombies looked less like zombi is than my colleagues do. And I'm not working in the morning either. <br /> <br /> So I recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a continuous comment on all the things going on behind scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because It just adds fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this gives a pass. Rent something like Feeders if you want a jaw badly bad in a funny way movie ...
