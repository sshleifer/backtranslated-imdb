Protected young woman, home-schooled and possibly very gifted, has a disturbed, overly emotional side that comes to the surface after her absence has put her mother to her mother and asks for divorce. Directed by the famous film photographer William A. Fraker, this unhappy psychological thriller falls into the trap that most movie hell of photographic leaders find themselves in: each shot is composed to the utmost style, but by victims of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping story. Fraker (and his cinematographer, László Kovács) are very fond of gauzy white and golden tones, giving the picture a burnt, tableaux feel. The mansion in the middle of the action looks like a funeral home, and Fraker shifts the hissing yarn like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiance), two of the most interesting actors in the 1970s, manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite convincing despite the heavy editing (which makes their scenes into small bits of half-realized business). Sondra Locke, another interesting screen personality, seems to shed her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion". Pale and saucer, with impressive thick and long hair, Locke is a curious human puzzle, and she is initially quite scary and dangerous; But this role is so old-hatred that Locke can't find anything fresh to bring out the deep freeze and her flounders. Fraker allows Lockes freak-out scenes to go on and on, while Shaw (looks terrifically debonair) is put in the impossible position to play touchy-feely father to her. All this nonsense may be worth striking if the manuscript had been whipped with a modicum of tangibility (or at least some peat or humorous relief). As it is, Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume's slap script, adapted from Stanton Forbes's novel "Go To Your Deathbed," comes immediately to the viewer, and only the charism of the players gets us to the finish line. * 1/2 from ****
