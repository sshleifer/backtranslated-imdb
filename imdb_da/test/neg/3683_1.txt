Hell's gates opened up and spit out this movie, then shut down again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies I've seen, just like any other movie. Nothing makes sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> It would really take too long to mention all the plot issues. In fact, except as a warning, it's really not worth wasting any of the almost endless space available on the internet to write about this movie. <br /> <br /> From now on I will check IMDb before watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Hot darn, IMDb forces me to write more about this movie. I suppose I should warn you about the Edison Force while I know it. But if you were to choose between the two, choose the Edison Force.
