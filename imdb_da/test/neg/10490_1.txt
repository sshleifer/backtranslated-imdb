This one is not even lively enough to be fun. There is something out there and ripping people off (off-screen) after an off-screen accident, while government leaders investigate (off-screen) and bad actors say stupid lines (on-screen), including a guy similar to Jim Carrey with hangover. The "monster" when it finally appears, looks like an extra from "Robot Monster", but there is not enough monster fu anyway. Fortunately, it's pretty short. Skip it unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this
