This was the typical female prison movie. I thought the women were very sexy and the outfits were great. All the camera was focused on the women, and the women were always in provocative bags for the camera and they were always scantily dressed (which I loved). This is your basic prison / breakout movie from the 70's. All I can say about this movie is that it is extremely cheesy, but the women are beautiful and their flames are good!
