<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations for low-budget, arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a kind of glow about him, the earthly, intellectual anti-hollywood vibe, a la Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan that make him a treasure with the critics from the get-go . <br /> But that's not a good movie. I'm sorry, it's just not. <br /> <br /> It winds. It has too many characters. The tone is uneven, its point of view is muddled, the play is across the board, from naturalistic to over the top. It lasts for long moments with small figures, we don't care and cut away from tense scenes just when things get good. <br /> <br /> It misses the mark. <br /> <br /> The worst mistake in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist, Edie Falcos Marly and Angela Bassett's Desiree, are straight-lined in characters that have no drive. Marly is an apathetic drunk, imbued with her own inertia. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own suppressed pain. When your two protagonists' worldviews can be summed up with the phrases "I don't care" and "I want to leave here", why should the audience give a rat patience? <br /> <br /> I'll be commonplace: Sayles writes a fun dialogue. He is very good at making a scene. The problem is that these scenes don't go anywhere. There is no spine for the film. No driving. The movie does not create rooting interest in any of the characters. In my opinion, he is too preachy about big bad corporate America gobbling up the little guy. <br /> <br /> To see a quality "little" movie, see David Lynch's "Straight Story." Pass this one up.
