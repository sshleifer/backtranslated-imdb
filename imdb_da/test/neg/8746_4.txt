As a child, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I haven't had the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught it, instead of a late Saturday afternoon, as there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing to do outside, but rake some autumn leaves. I figured this would be better. I was mistaken. <br /> <br /> The movie has some very good elements; a water-displaying mystic, a beatnik painter, a pair of idiot ranch hands, an older history buff and an "evil wind". Um ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head that, once the systematic hypnotism of every one present is complete, must look for his evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place on a vicious "ranch", which apparently neither grows crops nor detects evil pets. As everything is declared by their resident mystic to be "evil", you either roll your eyes terribly or laugh at your sides splitting depending on your mood. Me? I laughed until I had tears flowing down my face. <br /> <br /> I remembered this movie as one of those people who really bothered me like a kid. But some children are also afraid of Santa Claus. Anyway ... if you're in the 50's horror camp then it's definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good storyline, this movie has it. It is the supreme drama and just innocence of the time that makes it so horrendous. The action was just bad, but it still had some good items. Maybe it is a remake ...? <br /> <br /> It ranks 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
