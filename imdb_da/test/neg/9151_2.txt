I just saw a horrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A reviewer at Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right when he wrote "From A to Zzzzzzzzz." The story is about an English colonial shaker coming to Malaysia to "civilize the wild" so to speak and end up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English, who serves English-speaking colonialists and teaches them her mother tongue in return for ... well the film never makes it clear, but I can only assume he gives her money or something. Needless to say, the film focuses much more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young people when the forbidden love affair is enhanced by her culture, her soap opera home situation, and her own boundless stupidity in any major decision he makes throughout the film. So yes, the movie has some big flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things I rented it for the first time: a beautifully photographed exotic place and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman playing sleeping dictionary, Jessica Alba . My friend told me that this crazy movie was her on her most beautiful and marvelous, he was right. She is not a great actress, and does not pass entirely to Malaysian, and it is quite obvious that they are using a body double for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has the rare face and figure that is more than just sexy, but also beautiful in the way a Vivaldi violin concert or Rembrandt painting is. <br /> <br /> (PS Sorry all the feminists out there who discourage objectifying women, the "male look", etc., etc., but I hope you can understand that I don't mean something disrespectful.)
