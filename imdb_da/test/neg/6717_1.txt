I think this movie was made backwards, first they shoot a lot of scenes and actions and explosions, and then the writers of history began to work to find a story to tie all scenes together. This movie is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script. The movie makes no sense. Seriously, even if you are a Segal fan, there is no reason why you will ever see this movie except if you are one of those people who like to stare at accidents because it is a terrible accident and should never be released in this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
