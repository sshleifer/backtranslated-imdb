For me it is a case you never understand if you don't live it ... so read this to know why I would have such unlimited anger .. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot about (Bruce Lee) .. my father loved him .. my mother, who hates some minor shots of violence, loved him! and how she speaks to now about his "The Big Boss" aka "Fists of Fury" and the experience of seeing it on the Egyptian films 1973 with all the gigantic success. Also, I saw a really good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I found myself crying: where are your movies Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store .. and it was stupidly moving .. (you know why!) .. and waw .. I found many Bruce Lee movies .. I chose a named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it to myself and looked at one. OH GOD, please forgive your servant. I hurt myself, but without any particular decision. I wouldn't do it if I knew the evil was harmful !! its mythical level of secret !! <br /> <br /> After that I didn't understand at all what is the big trouble about Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ??? .. why anyone would like to know whether he is here or there .. this hero (who I have seen!) is not so gifted and not that genius and of course it is not so sexy ??? <br /> <br /> Until my father saw this star and he asked me to pause some of his close-ups and after he examined his face a little ... he told me in a very definite way "it is not Bruce Lee "! then I was too confused to ask: who is this stupid guy anyway ?? !! <br /> <br /> It was 2001 .. 2 years after my first entry to the IMDb database. That's why I immediately used to know who the hell is that man .. and I discovered the truth .. he's not Bruce Lee .. No my dear friends .. he's Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge .. so big difference !! I just want to know who can love the bad clone? Or god forbid .. love his repulsive movie .. I saw 2 of them and couldn't carry finishing the third! <br /> <br /> After that I ignored all our video stores because it was cheaply cunning (writing on the posters, it's Bruce Lee! ??) .. and I have the original .. The only Bruce Lee that is Such a great star indeed and oh dress, he certainly had the right to immortality .. and no less.
