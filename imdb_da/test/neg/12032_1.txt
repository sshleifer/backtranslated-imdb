A low budget can be an excuse for malfunctioning talent and pathetic appearance of false do. However, this is not an excuse for bad writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialogue without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialogue in this movie was on an equal footing with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training. I also understand that you have to make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. That being said, no serious instructor would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, "It was perfect". I see better character that works on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This movie had a paper-thin plot, bad acting, poor dialogue and no intelligent ideas at all. This just shows me that some independent films are the way of a reason. If you're looking for a quick scare, rent something else. Even "Cable Guy" was a scary movie. After watching this movie, I think I would have been better off seeing a re-run on the X files.
