"Ghost Son" is Lamberto Baba's best movie and at the same time also his worst. I assume that this statement requires some minor clarification. It's his best because it's well-aimed, ambitious, accessible, and very stylish, but his worst because it's a boring, unoriginal movie and undoubtedly a huge downturn for all the real fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: Many fans I myself surely included would not have been interested in this movie judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who led us with huge amounts of intricate Gialli and fun splatter movies earlier. "Ghost Son" is part of his comeback movie, along with "The Torture", and although the latter is not a good movie, it at least lives up to its fans' lines of anticipation, with large amounts of sleaze, blood and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and unacceptable soft horror movie, even speaking in the form of mainstream ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on sentimentality, and this affects the already limited number of terrible and frightening atmospheric moments. The basic premise may have one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is generally dull and overly clich√©. John Hannah and Laura Harring star as a good couple who live on a remote counter in South Africa and breed horses for living. The joy and happiness might not be improved, so of course something tragically bound to happen, and so does. Mark dies in a car accident, but the indestructible Stacey stays at the ranch, where she is in constant contact with Mark's spirit. She even gets pregnant with her baby, but shortly after baby, Martins birth mystery events begin to occur. It looks as if Mark's restless and selfish ghost "holds" the child and uses him to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and sub-areas are underdeveloped and / or inexplicable, just like the whole of the young teen's Thandi's background. There is too little action and the only real scare streams are also obviously borrowed from classic movies like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (vomit green goo, self-flowing furniture ??). Just talking about horrible entertainment "Ghost Son" is a painful misfire, but it must be said, it's a beautiful and enchanting look of failure. The camera is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really inventive and suggestive. The moody score at times even manages to create a grim atmosphere, even though there is nothing of any importance on the screen. There are several beautiful images of South African wildlife to admire, but if that interests you, I suppose you can better see National Geographic instead. Not much to recommend here. Fans of atmospherically driven ghost stories have much better options to choose from, and die-hard Bava fanatics are advised to (re-) see "Demons", "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
