Let's not fool us, okay? We all know that this movie was made because of the success of the "Grumpy Old Men" movies. Unlike them, however, this travesty has no humor and very little heart. Gloria DeHaven is the only shining light seen. It breaks my heart that she finally got the chance to show her skills to a new generation of movie guests, just to end up in a piece of drunk like this. There was a touching scene that showed her standing up by a person she was in love with. Her fine performance was the only quality that took place in "Out To Sea". Everyone else just goes through the movements. 2.10
