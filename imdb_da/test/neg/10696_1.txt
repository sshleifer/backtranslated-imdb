I agree with the other users comments. Hard to believe this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams in the mid-80s. I think it's baptized because the sound and the picture don't always match. If anyone can really say that this is a good movie, they must be unlocked. It's so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do everything to get it. I feel I have lost intelligence from seeing this. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I saw this, but now I just feel bad. I bought this as part of a 3 movie package for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say that I would have been better off literally throwing the money away. Forgive me Jesus.
