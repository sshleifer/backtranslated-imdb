The actors were not credible. The story was really weak, total sap and totally predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a pity that they did not focus more on the struggle for the Canadian struggle for independence. We have seen this love story many times before, only with better actors! We had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a little drama feeling! The sound track was completely disturbing. The deficit hit you over the head with sentimentality. But really over the top. The only thing we found OK was that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found the filmography, the Indian village relatively realistic.
