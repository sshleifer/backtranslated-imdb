The humor is non-existent in this loser of a movie. Carrot Top plays a surfer dude inventor who consistently blows the rent money on his goofy, useless inventions. Then he helps an old guy broken down beside the road, and voila, he acquired a bigger company. And on and on and on past the jealous relatives, the humanization of the company, hostile takeovers, the mandatory love interest .. aargh ... let's just say that this movie is almost unmatched. What Carrot Top has achieved is to convince me not to go to his stage shows.
