I can imagine what happened to this movie to be: a bunch of study runners sitting around, drinking gin-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them coming up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a movie that would bridge the generation gap, which was so far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find just as interesting - for various reasons, perhaps, but still a ticket is a ticket. What interested hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism and wild sets and costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals, eye candy, a feel-good script and nostalgia. Very good, so "Lost Horizon", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can't miss, don't you? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. On the shore he outlines a utopian community in Shangri-la, "The Blue Moon Valley", near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully satisfied villagers who serve a monastery of long-lived monks. Into Paradise is a Gilligan's island-like floating outsider (a veteran of WWI, a missionary, etc.) Each with their own spin on the situation - what plot is there for each of them to respond to being presented with a choice to stay in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century. Taken on its own terms, it is gentle, pop-lit fluff that presents Hilton's own conservative British views in "Oriental" dress, as exotic and as known as a fortune cookie. As imprisoned honored guests of the monks, castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never pushed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of it themselves), are treated royally and given simple but luxurious travel arrangements - who do I want to escape? In this Central American Sky-on-Earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is abundant and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing changes. The Nicks are throwing, but encouraged to look pretty, and even flirt a little (the given cause is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is non-threatening: revealed as one of the world's best mix of Christianity and Buddhism, there is little to offend anyone than the stubborn fundamentalist or oddball out there who actually knew anything about Tibet (as at the beginning of the thirties were a very small number). <br /> <br /> As a Capra movie focusing on the adventure / character interaction angles, it was enchanting; And maybe Steven Spielburg had made it fly if he had been there. As a Hollywood product from the early seventies, the adventure was too fast, and the updated list of characters is also gentle to get much of an impression. The monastery is deprived of the outlined, clear qualities of classic B & W, and it looks like a de luxe beauty in white and blue, while at least some of the monks' garments tried for historical accuracy, so most of the inmates as if they looked as if on the way to a morning massage and fango bath, with a few holes of golf in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim could have recovered some laugh at the story and play the right conflict within each character's reaction; just five years afterwards, Brian Eno would have captured the calm atmosphere of a T; Instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David got the job of writing the songs that married Muzak-like tunes with some of the most timid New Agey lyrics ever written. Naturally, every song requires a dance figure that ranges from the only forgettable to the completely boring, and then the script, which does not have a line worth quoting. <br /> <br /> Tie-ins with this movie were legion - everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this movie, and so was the hype I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. Almost the only good thing I can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review from memory almost thirty years later - next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of Bardo Thadol, and thus learned about true Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
