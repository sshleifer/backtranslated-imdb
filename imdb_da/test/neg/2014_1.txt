Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge", which I saw is a master class in how not to make a movie. A rag tag collection of misfit salvages the board a previously lost cargo ship "The Demeter" in the (cough) carpathian system (which is later upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and awakens a relentless evil (in this case the script). The movie is a bizarre bastardization of the Event Horizon, and regardless of the lameest vampire movie is always. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** After an abundance of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on, we open with a cheesy exposure type from Casper (stupid name ), who plays captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name) and instead of the actual character development continues to describe the twisted, incomprehensible oddities that make up his crew. Van Helsing jumps himself on a stump and carries a body heater all the time in a kind of retro 80's tribute to Han Solo (I guess). Occasionally Demeter's Captain appears in a kind of crazy video diary so as not to tell us anything about the consequence of a pronounced German accent (unfortunately, subtitles are not included). Crewmember Mina controls the abandoned ship (alone ??) armed only with a gun-shaped torch and thick Eastern European accent while talking to Van Helsing on his ship's bridge (which is essentially a single glittering wall). Mina has a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cap that continuously slides at the camera. Why this happens when the vampire is not yet made meat is never explained. This leads on to a shaking camera chasing Mina down the hallways until she runs into Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith might have been designed to write Humvee's lines, as most of them consist of Humvee and remind us that he is black every 10 seconds and says the word "ass" enough for a Guinness book of records while delivering all this in a "from DA hood" accent (it is year 3000, "DA hood" itself exists?) One of the main problems with this movie is that it is insanely trying to let its set be in the year 3000. Unfortunately Won everyone with healthy eyes doesn't buy this as Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet style ocean going thoughts. Possibly the movie staff thought it would be okay to leave the hammer and seal symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of Lenin next to a lot of cupboards and explain it away as a kind of futuristic communist comeback special. The crew apparel looks as if they were raided from an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993), and they are armed to the teeth at the latest in the 20th century's automatic weapons (with added year 3000 zing when fired), which of course is not is against vampires. Healthcare is a past (in the future), as the simple professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair ??? My god, what happened to all the genetic engineering things. The professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip off from Alien Resurrection, who had their own rag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who was strangely not killed). Fans didn't take Prof as he was scared in many scenes. If I were buried in a Soviet ship out of wheelchair, pursued by bad vampires, and everyone left me, because I was such a sneaking string, I would be afraid. <br /> <br /> During the UN-dramatic Mina Chase scene, the profen informs us (with feeling) "it's disturbing". The rest of his lines are also confusing "bugs" and "we all are going to die" X 100 follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as vice-captain (what happened to 1st officers?) in what I thought would be the tired, standard problem, hard nosed, no nonsense, "don't look me up unless I tell you also, "beat 10 stuntman at once super treasure, but it's a Z-flick so she carries pretty much a tightly-cut cut top and even tighter leather pants. Coolio's performance increases the ham factor by 90% and is a camper than a number of tents, but fortunately for us he dies soon enough. Although he seems to hold his heart on the right side of his body. After a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using lumpy Soviet style controls and in the dorm crew find themselves stranded as their own squatters to find a more interesting crew (probably). Why Dracula himself is mentioned is unknown when the biggest evil guy named Orlock, who is Space Transylvanian for "crimes against fashion" that he dandies about in a big puffy, frilly shirt and even bigger star collar, making Hammer Horror Vampires looks smart in comparison. Orlock stops explaining his entire back story (off camera) to Erica Eleniak, but fails to kill her in another rip-off twist from Alien Resurrection. His back story is such a bit choppy, it's not worth repeating. Since the budget can't afford match coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even real end titles (the first cast list I saw were the same characters but totally different and Italian names) the movie is beginning to destroy, what you were pursuing with. Fortunately, the crew is able to fight back with the help of a ship's computer that contains unclear, millennium-old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some useful 20-year-old pool signals found in the ship's recreational space (up to your holodeck) . The ending is horrible and a little suspicious, either they run out of money or the former Soviets demanded their ship return. I went into this movie and knew it was bad but ignorant of how bad it really was.
