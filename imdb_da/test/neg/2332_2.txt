There is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a movie like this. I remember feeling the same after ignoring Dogma. If you don't like a movie that is strange and controversial like Mulholland Dr., you are seen as "not getting it." Of course, for those who have already seen this movie, you know that the whole point is not working. <br /> <br /> I have heard from several sources that the unique and sympathetic aspect of this movie is a dream come true. In other words, the plot is not structured like other movies. With Mulholland Dr. it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third-class boy who was delaying to the last second to make his art project. It does not make sense, it should not, but I know first that it should be a television series. It looks like Lynch had a stack of unused movie and decided to blend it in with a bunch of new stuff. You will notice that at the end, the nudity, the sexy and the evil language grow. Everything he wouldn't have filmed for television. For a better movie that was not told in a traditional linear way, you must hire The Thin Red Line from 1998. It was a great movie, it is not. <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
