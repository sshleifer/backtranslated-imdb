I can't believe this show was okay-ed. First outside J.P. Manoux is a horrible job that fills David Spade's and Pacha's voice too deeply compared to John Goodmans. The theme song is so annoying and the episodes are so stupid !!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain as the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. Half of the episodes are copied by the movie. In my opinion, the emperor's new groove was one of the best children's films this year, but they were completely destroyed by making Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should see such shows as SpongeBob, Fair Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible, but not this show.
