I had great hopes to see this as I always enjoy Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good as Darwin and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with. <br /> <br /> The origin of Darwin's book was one of the most groundbreaking, controversial and innovative publications ever, but you will never believe it based on this boring movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is hardly anything about Darwin's five-year journey on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, for example, certainly of the highest importance to history, as it was from his studies of wildlife then that he began to form his theory of evolution. <This is just a long, boring home drama, with Darwin portrayed as a somewhat loathing eccentric, who sees the sight of his dead daughter everywhere and becomes cold shoulder by his emotionally constipated wife. Jennifer Connelly's depiction of Emma Darwin is nothing short of terrible and has little relation to historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, either from Emma or from the local priest, as played by Jeremy Northam (a blink-and-you-miss that is a complete waste of one talented actor) to counterbalance Darwin's views, but it was not addressed. The story focused too much on infinite mawkish mood about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie, and too much time was also wasted in Darwin and wondered if he should write his book or not. Eventually, I was so sorry that it was hard to care for. All in all, it was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.
