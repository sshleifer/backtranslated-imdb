Seriously! You just got to see this movie to understand everything wrong with it. It came out in the period when everyone was trying to make family films that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals, Mr. Nanny, etc.), but it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the film is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who only shows aggravation and fatigue, possibly in the tired clich√© that this movie enjoys. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the biggest mistake in the movie was not the play or the movie, but especially the writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, although this film lacks the wholehearted IL 'Walt managed to withdraw. Junior's Dad, (John Ritter) makes you angry without doing anything, simply because he allows Junior to run unattended and gives him a strict warning when he ties a 200-pound shelf to a chalk board. <br /> <br /> Junior's grandfather is also extremely uncomfortable. For those of you who saw the first one, found it nauseating and not the other, "Big Ben Healy" as he is mentioned in this movie, is still a total shower. He basically goes into John Ritter's house uninvited, settles in Junior's room, though he says he hates junior and basically does nothing to speed up the movie's speed or to support the movie in any way. Instead, he goes out of the audience by being a lazy free loader. Finally, we are introduced to a wide range of new figures, such as. Smug, uncomfortable, Trixie, who carries dynamite in the backpack, which she first lights, then hands, to Junior, who simply stares wide at her eye. Also, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the unpleasant principal at Junior's new elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to come over, I simply put it: This film reeks! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the actors' beliefs shine through the movie, even though the manuscript sucks.
