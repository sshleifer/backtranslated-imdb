I bought this because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and one of my friends was in it and for $ 1.99 how bad could it be? Then I read some comments on the movie and began to get excited - perhaps it was really a lost gem, one of the great little B-movies that everyone had forgotten, but deserved to be revived. WRONG! I'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it came from a few quarters here, but I found it one of the most boring and blatantly bad-filled movies I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's hokey Texas accent (right from the Georgia part of Texas, I think). It's just stupid. No one in the film behaves like a real man. None. And no one does anything credible or interesting. It's not even a clich√© party. It is only 80 minutes of frames going on. It even managed to make Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now it's incredible.
