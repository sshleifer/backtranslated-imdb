I am one of those slings for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days - I'll still check them out every now and then. My observation is that most of them are not very funny, even those on large networks that get high ratings, I just don't understand who finds them gut busting fun. While a few have made me crack a smile, none of them laughed out loud, I usually change the channel after a few minutes. Now on the FOX network they are churning out new shows like changing your underwear, for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom, wrong badly wrong. They've beaten this dead horse so much, it's just to find out who they can find to write a crappy pilot with poor dialogue and just throw them out. Let's see a short piece of the last piece of junk that Fox has churned out called "the war at home" <br /> <br /> I saw about 5 minutes of it and it was generous. In this special episode, her daughter meets her parents, so I am an adult now ranting. The girl gets tired, tells her: "OK fine, go ahead and do what you want. If you turn up, it is your problem" as she replied: "Well, I think you're angry, but at least I haven't got AIDS "(cue the laugh track, no way that can be a living audience unless they have been paid to applaud such waste) whether or not to have AIDS to be in such bad taste. Well, anyway, I don't need to see more of this crap. Take a tip FOX, stop wasting your time with sitcoms. Okay, you have the Simpsons, but it also gets really old and tired.
