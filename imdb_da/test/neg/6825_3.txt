When you tell these events that took place a few years ago (it was hard to believe that this actually happened), I thought there is a basis for an interesting story here. Many secrets were never uncovered, the horse was never found, the main conspirators were never caught, etc. <br /> <br /> But this movie seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention is paid to the plot. Some other questions have been raised, however, like why on earth would Mickey Rourke be in this movie? It's good to see rourke's career taken off again, but he must ring by mentioning this nonsense. <br /> <br /> If the topic interests you, do an internet search on the subject, you will be more educated and dare I say more entertained. Avoid this.
