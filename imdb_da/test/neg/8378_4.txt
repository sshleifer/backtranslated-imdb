A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off, at least I hope this is what they were supposed to, because at least then I could respect the director to admire Tarantino. A scene a "song" scene with Rose McGowan is far too well done and brilliant for this movie and could only have been stumbled by a mistake by this director. In addition to his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her good scene, this movie sucked. Some of the toughest dialogue I have ever heard, I am willing to consider why McGowan does not speak much is because of how bad her dialogue would have been. Trying to be fun, never, trying to be dark and not, trying to be stylish and just gentle. Who corrects the money to make movies like this, I hope they were all directors, so no one else's money was wasted. If not for McGowan, the whole cast is terrible and when McGowan is your best hmmm, I must wonder.
