I saw "Gristle" primarily the presence of Michael Dorn when I enjoyed his Worf depiction on Star Trek TNG, but had never seen him out of his makeup. Dorn seems to have a good presence and probably has the potential for a profitable play. However, this movie gave him a little dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can actually use the "F" word. It seems that this movie is made by a person who fancied himself as a forward thinking thinker, with a social conscience. Yes --- for 1965. Today the themes are so immersed and sophomoric and cornball that even Spike Lee's terrible "Bamboozled" looks good in comparison. <br /> <br /> This crime-caper flick has a complicated labrynth of double, triple and quadruple crosses, but the plot scheme is so unnoticed that it collapses itself within the first 30 minutes. For the most part, after that point, I just looked out of momentum and a gentle curiosity about how each scene would play out. There is a great cast here - you will recognize almost everyone as a character actor from much better movies. Why are they all in this? I suppose it was 1) Work and some money, though it was modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around LA --- you may know they were participating to support him as a giant movie guy on the third and fourth part of the Hollywood scene. Dunno ... but the movie was half-baked --- not really "finished." I gave it a 3, although my love for the actors involved was unhindered from my admiration for their previous work. Let us hope that everyone has moved on to more professional, more carefully executed and more thorough projects since.
