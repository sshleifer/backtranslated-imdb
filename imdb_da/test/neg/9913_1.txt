Anyone complaining about Peter Jackson, making movies too long, should sit through this CBS event. There are about 45 minutes of history upholstered by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring rolling TV dramas. Poor science is a staple of crappy weather disasters, so I'm not complaining about it. Stupid science can be fun to see if it is performed in a fun way. What kills this movie is that it is 10 subplots ... all of which could be carved without destroying what would be the central plot. The one character that is entertaining to see in category 6 is Tornado Tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype. Note that I also don't bother commenting on special effects. Their quality should not come as a surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
