Now the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - the modern king with low budget flicks, be it on TV or directly to video (I doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of recording B-movie dual functions and all). <Br /> <br /> Creates of such cult (?) Classics like Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... Well, I kind of like these guys stuff. Its most entertaining (in a clearly cheesy, campy and particularly cheap kind of way) and if he is one thing, he is a pro - something you can't say to all the guys in the movie biz. <br /> <br /> But this one flick here is among the weaker in his upper hand. Insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to get your brain stupid in minutes. If you are looking for genuine F.O.R. goodness (or rather bad), beware of the above, and generally his things from the 70s and 80s (I think he lost a bit of his edge lately).
