I really don't understand how that movie could get a rating greater than 4 here on IMDb. It's simply a huge mess, and I have to admit that I actually liked AvP 1: Close to no story, okay, I can live with it, but at least they first came right away. AvP 2 does not. After the stupid premise has been presented, there are well over half an hour of stupid and unsuitable teenage cliches, stupid as hell dialogue and close to nothing else, except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have the first half of the movie and Predator scenes that make you ask yourself about the guys making the movie, so even see any other Predator movie or just don't care enough to be bothered. <br /> <br /> After that, the crap party finally comes to the point where the predator starts attacking aliens, or at least pretends to do so. And boy, is Predator stupid, blind and deaf. It's terrible. How he even managed to serve the things he has is over me. He misses with almost every shot, only notices foreigners when they are right in his face, or if it is absolutely necessary for the script so he can move where he should be. He is even surprised by bad human teens and deputies all the time. What should that guy be? After the first hour of the abomination I was almost always shaking my head on each scene. Close to no scene in this movie goes by without incredibly stupid dialogues, stupid Predator actions or stupid missing there or stupid acts from our "heroes". <br /> <br /> Finally, the thing ends. To my surprise, I and my friends did not know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I missed leaving the room was half-crying, half laughing about the 1 1/2 hour they were just wasted. <br /> <br /> Don't watch. Never.
