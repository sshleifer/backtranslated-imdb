There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read the revolution for hell of that or any of his other writings. Abbie was often dismissed as the Clown Prince in the 60's, but he was an idea man who used his wisdom, sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to get his ideas on his mind. The media often focused on the man, not the ideas, and that is also the problem with this movie. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this flick is like a National Enquirer version of Abbie. He deserves better. If you don't know Abbie or his times, this movie won't help. <br /> <br /> This movie is located. I give it a zero. <br /> <br />
