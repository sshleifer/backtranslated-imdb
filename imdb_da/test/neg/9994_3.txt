In this movie, we are invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk by someone who does not like to start with. What was the point of making the movie then? To show that it would have been better not to have IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire for keeping our hero's integrity intact? Almost. He behaves at the party at the start of the film in the same way as he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Should we be careful that Capote looks seriously at his claim that he and the murderer Perry Smith are related spirits, the former having all breaks while the latter had no? Sir. Capote's situation did not affect me at all, I'm afraid, so if it was the central idea, it was wasted on me. But even though I could understand why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us, the lumpy storytelling would still have bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a bravura performance without emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I long for more of them. Dreary beyond belief.
