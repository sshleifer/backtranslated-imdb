I never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused. Especially in French and neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am, for example), "Baise-Moi" was announced as the most shocking and thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. Yeah right! It may be a bit shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone being shot in the ass?) But the weak and meaningless plot has probably not made me think much. "Baise-Moi" is another of the "accuse everything that goes wrong on society" films, and they are generally not very convincing. About 99% of the population work perfectly well in this community, so why would you blame the same community for the futile and hopeless actions of two staggered nymph girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flash. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother and the two meetings in an abandoned train station late at night. They decide to travel together in France and leave a trace of sex and blood where they stopped. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this movie is very boring to sit through. Just as the girls indicate themselves all the time, the dialogues are paralyzed and the people they run into (and kill?) Are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, it is fine for me, but please do not pretend it is art house film making. If you leave the sword and hip-camera work, all there is to see is that (not so) arouses pornography. Cold soundtrack, though!
