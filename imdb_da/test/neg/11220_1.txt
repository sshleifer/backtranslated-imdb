This movie is so bad they wouldn't buy it back at my local used CD / DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought the other two movies I sold from the four disc sets, but they didn't buy underworld, and the other two movies redefined the rank, so what does this movie say? So I tried to sell it back to another store that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back the underworld either. This film is bad at all levels and is one of those that came out in the mid 90s after the Tarantino clone. The only slightly redeeming element is Dennis Leary, who tells Joe Montegna that he is a "smelly friend" and calls him "Mister Stinky Friend". This line is so terribly awful that I can't help quote it at least once a week when describing a smelly friend. But now that I have informed you of this quote, you do not have to go through the pain of watching this movie.
