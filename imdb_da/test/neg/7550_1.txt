I had seen Rich Mayall in Blackadder and New Statesman so I thought I'd try this movie. <br /> <br /> At around noon 16.00 I bought it around noon. 8.15 pm I quickly forwarded the remaining movie to see if there was anything left for a human with a brain ... but it wasn't. Around. At 16.45 I threw the DVD into the trash. And this is where "movie" belongs. <br /> <br /> What happened to British humor? The humor is as nice and witty, intelligent and artificial as you find in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? The black humor Britain is so famous for? I don't want to offend anyone, but I suppose even stupid kids wouldn't find it fun. They deserve more intelligent fun. And Rich Mayall, you can do better, so please, do!
