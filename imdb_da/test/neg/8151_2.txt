Gave it two stars because the DVD deck was good enough to get me to buy this piece of manure. I paid a dollar for it on the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a couple of good movies (at least I think they are good) that have never been seen inside a video store. Having seen this, I'm really offended by it. Light years worse than anything I've ever seen, I can't even recommend this as a campy joke movie. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh it makes you angry. How did this horrible movie find any kind of distro? I can only believe it was self-proprietary as the amateur DVD writer would suggest. To the producers of this "movie" coming out of the business, it is obvious that you have no talent for it.
