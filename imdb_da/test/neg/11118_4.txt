Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never register me on my movie meter. But in spite of the only fact, this is not a bad little thriller, given the low budget, low quality effects, rigid and Sci Fi Channel aspects. Blood effects are very convincing, and Chupacabra actually looks realistic ... no matter what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is a beautiful Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> Apart from the positives, this sort of runs like Kolchak: Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) meets the love boat, but despite the ultimate cheese of this work, it still contains something similar to a plot, and actually trying to get your respect while laughing and rolling your eyes. <br /> <br /> As in conflict with this work, I still managed to find a pleasure here. Maybe you will too. It ranks a 5.2 / 10 on the Made 4 TV Scale. <br /> <br /> It bets a 4.1 / 10 at Movie Scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
