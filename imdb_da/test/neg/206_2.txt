An elevator movie with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds good on paper? I suppose it should have done when someone green lit the production of this movie, but the end product is terrible! The story is boring, the action boring, and for a movie that is only 88 minutes seems to just pull on. I could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better I should have done ... any paint to look dry somewhere maybe? <br /> <br /> Sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what on earth did he think when he joined this? There are so many other great action movies around ... go see one of them and let this movie be forgotten best.
