I remember when this came out, it was the first kung fu movie ever seen in our way and we were all happy to see it safe. Although the action was at best mediocre, it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as poor movie production or, more precisely, the way Chinese made movies at that time. They were worse off without question, but there was entertainment value here, and it certainly was. Kung fu craze had begun, and Bruce Lee and "The Chinese Connection" would soon follow it or "The Chinese Boxer" with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this movie was chosen to lead the way.
