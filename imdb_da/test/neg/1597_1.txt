Okay, so not all Australian movies are all that good. Yes, maybe there have been very few with much profit. Take it away But it's an absolute bomb that qualifies as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would like it. I figured I'd give it a fair go. I even met one of the screenwriters Dave O'neil, so I feel like a traitor who gives this movie a bad review, but ... The reason is pretty thin (I won't disturb it ... read the synopsis ) that I can forgive: there are lots of movies that can cover it with some decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away's jokes cover up his plot as a $ 2 prostitute skirt. Probably the only laugh coming from the 6 other people in the cinema was the bad play and dialogue. Take Away goes down like a week old Dim sim ... You might understand the joke if you see the movie, but joke is not worth it.
