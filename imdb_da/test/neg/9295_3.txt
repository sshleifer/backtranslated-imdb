**** Contains Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched this show finally come so I could see it. I lost it so I could see it several times and there is something about this show that really bother me! <br /> <br /> I recognize that this was a movie for television. Not only that, but it was made for life, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for television, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both very talented actors, definitely did not reach their best abilities. I can see that Don Diamont's character was so clich√©d that you knew when you saw him he was the villain. I can even pass the obvious mistake in the timeline (she was raped during the winter holidays and then over a year later she has the baby from it.) The big thing I can't get over is this: There are two attempts for the child's custody . In the first attempt, custody is assigned to the child's father because he is "better educated, has an education from a community colleague and has a full-time job." In the second trial, the verdict is reversed because the judge feels that there is no evidence that Emma (RLC's character) is an imperfect mother, and custody should not be taken from the primary caretaker and given to a person without prior interaction with children. <br /> <br /> The problem is this: Nowhere in these trials is the fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and got the pregnancy taken into account! Whether it was rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Wouldn't it be taken into consideration when the judge chose him for custody because he is a "mature adult?" Older adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> It's not the worst cable movie you'd ever see, but it's not a good show either. ** out of ****
