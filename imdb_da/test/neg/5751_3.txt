At the beginning of 'Loggerheads' we are introduced to three pairs of apparently unrelated characters. To make the case even more confusing, we are informed (via titles on the screen) that the action takes place in three separate timelines (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but in the end we'll see how the three pairs are related: Mark Austin, a young man in his 20s, gay and HIV positive is alienated from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a driver and arrives at Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside resort where he meets George (sensitively played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved in each other. Meanwhile, Mark's mother-in-law, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find her son she gave up for adoption when she was 17. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother has decided to track her alienated son, whom she misses him (despite her homophobic ministers husband). <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' that we are told are based on a true story, and that is perhaps its Achilles Heel. Director / writer Tim Kirkman is trying too hard to create scenes filled with dramatic excitement where there is little to find. Take Mark and George ?? they are both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about. There is a little bit of excitement when Grace faces an Adoption Agency Director, who is prohibited by law from giving her any information about her lost son and a slight conflict with her mother who refuses to refuse her when she became pregnant as a teenager. No sparks fly either between Elizabeth and Robert, as the good honorary man, for his part, has maintained from the outset that he does not intend to join his son. <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' look like 'Brokeback Mountain' because the gay couple are the good guys and the straight men (for example, the Kure Beach policeman and the honorary man) are bad. The biggest downfall of the movie is that there is no interaction (and hence no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers". Mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has the opportunity to join him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both a demand for tolerance and a call for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late! The Church's feelings are mostly appropriate, but they do not create good drama. Loggerheads move at the snail's pace without giving new revelations (or tensions) on topics such as AIDS, adoption, and homophobia. In the end, "Loggerheads" fails due to lack of originality.
