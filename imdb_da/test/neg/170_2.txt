There were so many classic films that were made, where the leading people were out-and-out liars, and yet they were made to look good. I've never bought into those things. The "Screwball Comedies" were full of those things, and so were many of the Fred Astaire films. <br /> <br /> Here Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous "country" magazine writer who has lied to the public for years and feels she must continue to lie to keep her persona (and her job). She is even lying on a guy getting married, another subject that was always trivialized in classic movies. She is a New York City woman who pretends to be a good cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Of course she doesn't know anything, and the lies jump up as fast as you lose track. I suppose everything must be fun because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. Please send the barf bag. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is not fun. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, send the bag again.
