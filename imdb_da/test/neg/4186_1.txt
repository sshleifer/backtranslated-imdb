My friends and I often have jokes that movies are in real time. But this movie is really ... They will literally show 4 minutes of nothing, but a guy digs in dirt with his hands. It has no plot and an incredible amount of free screaming. I honestly don't think it won a prize for the alleged excitement. If you are like me and saw the first movie and loved it, because it is terrible to act, by a scary hilarious one liners and all-around low budget "ness", it doesn't matter; This is so bad that bad memories can even rub off and damage any good memories you have of the original. You would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen.
