Can there be a worst movie? Even Ed Wood on his terrible worst couldn't come up with anything so bad. Cheesy, stupid, long lasting, terrible ... and these are the good points. I saw this garbage back in the early 80's when I was incredibly bored at first, and actually put me through the whole thing without blowing my mind out, though it would probably have been a more enjoyable experience. I actually remembered it because it was so bad. It makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making television films (ie Spielberg), and it was a wonderful way for them to get their original material to the public, but shit like this just totally killed the whole treat.
