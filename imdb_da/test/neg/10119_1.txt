First of all, I really don't understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. It's the worst I've ever seen. Even the actors seem to be bored ... and I think it says everything! <br /> <br /> But I must give my applause to the open-minded creators - this team seems to have a really good future. Therefore, I recommend the big studies to look ONLY at the opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if they are seen outside of this movie, it almost looks like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this ... this "thing!"
