This movie was chosen, frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store. It turned out to be quite pig. The baseline - as it is - was uneven, inconsistent and predictable. The actors are constantly so embarrassed about the poorly written lines. The only fun moment in the whole movie was about the dangers of smoking and the accidental spread of an airbag. The rest of the movie lacked the pause to entertain one of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law or even the cat or dog. My advice, if you are tempted to borrow this turkey, is to save your money and your time. Look for something else ...
