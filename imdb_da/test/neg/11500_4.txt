Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so I'm happy to see some of their movies. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of sweets. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg-shaped string and manages to push the doctor (Billy Gilbert) out of the window and clings to it and gets Ollie up to the ceiling. When the situation smells, Stan Ollie's clothes, which the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally abandoned by the nurse, filled with a sleeping substance that comes into effect while he is running (which you can tell is made with a car in front of a big screen. Filled with a little similar slapstick and not so bad (although it is a repetition and a somewhat predictable) classic comedy, it's not great, but it's a black / white movie Worth watching, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on the Comedian comedian.
