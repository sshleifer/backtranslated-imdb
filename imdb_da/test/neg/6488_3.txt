This movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest reputation) who are on their way to a small fort to take over a recently derived uncle property where they plan to shop. Upon arriving at a nearby town, they find no one who will walk there (although it is only 15 kilometers away) so they go. When they get there they find that there are no soldiers, but a good amount of people who have taken over the use of the fort and built a small town nearby. They soon find that something is not here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead of going into the plot line, I'll make some comments on things I noticed about the movie. First out of the play is very flat, few people seem to be right enough to believe. However, my first was bad acting, but in the end I saw some of the exits, and the same people became alive. So my only thought left is how the instructor wanted it. On top of the bad acting, I have a big problem where people do not respond directly to a given set of circumstances. Take for example no one would take them to Ft McMillan at all costs, even though it is only 15 miles away. But when we arrive at the fort, we find it well maintained by a decent population of people who all have to get supplies from one and not at all mail etc. It was supposed to take place in 1867, but we can see the rail car has electric lights ( They are not at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style locomotives so popular at that time. There are also places where you can see paved blacktop (and maybe a car at some point, didn't want to bother to go back and see) and other anachronistic elements. If they had followed the rules of the "world", they did and let the actors be actors, it could have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 I gave it, and they wrote about it 4 times, it could have done even better.
