I watched this movie in the cinema. I took classes in Second City Chicago, and of course this movie was very intense. It's a Woodward movie about one of Second City's native sons. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about John's story. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lor did not make him particularly friendly to women in improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. The man led his life and he was loved intensively by the people who were in his world, and lore also says he treated all his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea that poor Michael Chilklis (who is a really good actor) is in a really amazing movie, and really excluded himself from imitating the man. Forget the idea that they couldn't get the rights to any of Belushi's work ... and all SNL scenes never happened as they portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Screw the idea that half of the historical information in the movie didn't even follow Bob Woodward's work. Kinda says "Okay ... we're messing with Belushi ... Let's also go after Woodward too ..." They also decided to take the premise for It's a wonderful life and make it. It's a terrible life on crack. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian angel or the devil? Is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device ... how many different endings can you handle for a movie? It's one of those movies when it's over ... you're looking at the person you're with, and in stunned disbelief goes "What the hell was that?" In some circles, this film has become a kind of cult classic. But for good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult classic sits around the screen and makes fun of (or throwing out snappy one liners) on the screen. A cult movie is never good. And most would never see them in any serious context. <br /> <br /> Want to see some classic bad late-80s fair stony? Rent Wired. If you want to know about John Belushi ... you can get more information out of the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie.
