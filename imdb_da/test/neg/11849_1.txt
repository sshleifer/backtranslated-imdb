<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If you fancy JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their pure entertainment value, if not for their quality (case in point-John Carpenter's DARK STAR highly recommended) <br /> <br /> If you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general - <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE THEM FROM THIS CINEMATIC CIRCUIT PERIOD! <br /> <br /> The shameless use of stock footage from CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 Makes most of this miserable attempt at a dino / slasher flick-Tag scene, for example, where the security guard meets his death in Alpha T-Rex Jaws . For some reason he falls about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why? Simply because this scene was lifted directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a crummy flick to begin with. The end was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who are unlucky enough to have sat through the straight-to-video loser. Again we see that Mr. Rex is fighting a bulldozer that changes like a forklift through the miracle of-da-daa! - stock footage from the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1 & 2. Of course, the end is exactly the same - the animal falls to its death just as the complex goes up in flames. <br /> <br /> A real insult to everyone's intelligence. <br /> <br /> But it's still better than seeing ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * out of ***** <br /> <br />
