Killer Flood: Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even at the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me, let me correct myself, even at the low standards of television disaster film, it is truly awful. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The women's model may have seen a picture of a dam, but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that produce electricity, oh I do not know a power plant nearby, some gateways for water to run through, even a high voltage power cord or two. <br /> <br /> The pond is also a little understaffed. Two, counting them, two employees employed the entire dam, all three shifts. And the employees were apparently imported from a clich√©d ridden world war two films, as they heroically and quite inappropriately have long eulogized death scenes complete with pictures of grandchildren floating by. Heck one of them manages to be shot by the dam itself in a manner that tolerates description. <br /> <br /> The special effects consist of liquid water superimposed on the city's photograph in a method that makes a threesome of Godzilla movies look like the Matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue crayon on the film layer would have yielded better results. Since the shots of the disaster are worthless, how is the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the script and the play follow special effects. This is no diamond in ru. This is rough. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is horrible enough to generate some laughs, and the film itself has the serious incompetence that makes a good cult classic, but bad disaster films should age as a fine wine. (Lavine, Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green is hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever, ever to match the great Henry Fonda being pelted by raisins to be murderous beers. Check back with me in 2024.
