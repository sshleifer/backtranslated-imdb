A modern scary movie? Yep it is .. The Hippies, peacenics and environmentalists came together to give us a movie of fear .. I do not recognize it as I only look at it 2 years ago that it was a fear movie, but that's exactly what it is is. <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this movie and the movie that Nazi made about us in ww2 and the same movies we made about them. This is pure propaganda and speaks only to those who believe in foreigners, 9/11 conspiracy cards, faked moon landings, peak oil and major environmental sciences. What I can say is this movie makes push buttons, you get to ask questions and ultimately just forget it .. It's a scary movie .. so if your scar comes in your houses, lock your doors and make up for the nuclear winter, we all know, comes when the bush provokes the Chinese in nuclear war.
