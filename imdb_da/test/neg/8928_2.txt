STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal - not as bad an actor as Kevin Costner but ....... aaaaahhhh, you get it) is a modern Robin Hood (listen closely, you can hear Brian Adam's music playing in the background ... no, not really), the kind of guy who steals bad blood money from drug dealers and use it to keep run-down orphanages open. But now he has been approached to drive a getaway car in a heist from Las Vegas in one of the last things before retirement type jobs. But of course it goes wrong and he wins up for the patsy for the big guys at the top and in prison. Here he meets a guy named (although you wouldn't know it from being aware of the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), who he forms a friendship with and ends up breaking out of prison with. When he is free, he is out to prove his innocence, find the lack of money and of course come to those who hit him! <br /> <br /> Of all Seagal's latest video clips, Today You Die has looked at most of it in a movie theater, even with a rap star as his co-star as his former movie Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yes, it works when he doesn't make movies about taking care of the environment, he pretends to be black and co-starring with rappers. But TYD is not a movie, and it is a luxury. The Big is never enjoying again until Under Siege 3 materializes (if ever!) The movie opens with a smooth, polished look that commands attention but it all goes down the hill quickly. Once Seagal has hit the prison, the list loses that connection. In fact, Treach's character just seems to emerge from nowhere without any introduction like his sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in it. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I've said it before, but I think I mean it this time. I don't think I will ever give more of these to the video Seagal movie ever. I honestly have no enthusiasm to see Shadow Man at all. In fact, I can honestly say that I have not really enjoyed any of his STV films up to this point and today you are certainly no exception, an apathetic, boring effort all round best avoided by all. *
