Based on an Edgar Rice Burrough's novel, the Earth's core provides little more than means to escape and rest your brain. A Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) discovers a giant excavator which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to cork their way deep into the ground to investigate what mysteries it can hold. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman beings who have conflict with prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> Cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying. Instead of being a bold adventurer, he comes across straight. On the other hand, McClure persuaded himself to be ridiculous. Caroline Munro plays the beautiful princess Dia, who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast are: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
