Normally I will not bother to comment on a horror movie sequel because it is usually assumed that they are bad, and if you see them with healthy respect, they can be very funny and comfortable to fool / laugh. But this chapter in the ongoing Halloween saga came close to gumbing up everything the original stood for. In the very first movie, Dr. Loomis (very pointed I could add) that Michael Myers was evil and it is trying to explain why (doing a bad job of what I can add). In my opinion, he was very scary as he was just a blood hungry freak. The whole goth / cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a dull, predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be fun.
