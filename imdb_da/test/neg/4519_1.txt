This is absolutely nothing like WWF and WWF 'Attention Era'. I have always been a dedicated WWF fan and I have never seen a glimpse of its competition. Now I rank the day I wanted WWF to take responsibility. At least, the WCW would constantly try new and radical instead of stopping as a mask of the show's current intentions, and so does the ECW. WWF has always been about Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant, and other ancient wrestlers as such, and "Attention Era" only happened to catch up on the radical ideas of the competition. WWE is the same garbage as it was before Attention Era only stumbled down and demoralized. The wrestlers are horrible, the fire split is mind scrambling, and the story lines and provisions are non-existent. WWE is so bad that it even ceases to be a past must by itself by pushing characters and wrestlers in the main event suddenly and by maintaining creativity barriers. Sure, the show shakes the brain of sweet, innocent, and easily brainwashed children and bad, miserable, parious, stupid people in the Internet Wrestling Community, who actually consider the company good. Anyone who shakes and rests on the idea that this show and product is good can go directly to hell.
