I know curiosity killed the cat, but I simply had to see the restoration of psycho, especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work. I've seen the original Psycho, but since I was a kid, I knew how to respect it and not just that, it was an excellent movie! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard about remake was "How do you reintroduce perfection?" I'm stuck in it too, but I think I have a more open mind now and maybe figured it was a way to introduce Psycho into a new generation. <br /> <br /> But it became a total insult and left to face the original Psycho. I know this has been said, but I saw the film's presentation, and the director was like "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot every scene shot by shot like the original" ... what's the friggin point? ! OK, but I will judge this movie on its own, even if it is offensive blowing the original. I think the actor wasn't quite up to each other, but frankly it seemed that the actors just saw the original and just remembered the lines from there and made it their crazy own. <br /> <br /> Looking at the production of this movie, I would have released Anne Hasche, she said, "I've never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, it made me angry, honestly, it wasn't just that, she really sucked in this role as Marian, she wasn't convincing, not to mention her shower room was really awful. Vince Vaughn didn't ... let's just put it this way, the movie was terribly misunderstood. This was a sin against film and on its own it was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could have been a new introduction to a new generation. But to Gus, let the film do the one who knows what they are doing! <br /> <br /> 1/10
