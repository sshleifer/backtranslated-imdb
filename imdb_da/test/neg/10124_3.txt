When naive young Eddie Hatch, a wardrobe at the Savory's Department Store, falls to a statue of Venus and gives her a kiss kiss, the stairs turn out of her pedestal and give Eddie more than he negotiated. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do for a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the top class songs. The purpose was to create a safe, popular film without too much investment, while exploiting Ava Gardner's upward mobility to superstars. Robert Walker as Eddie is lost in a solvable role. Eddie is not only naive, but dithering and unhappy. Gardner is beautiful, but the only things that give the movie life are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girl friend, Tom Conway as the sovereign owner of Savory and Eve Arden as Savory's long time, wise cracking secretary. It is a role that Arden could play in his sleep, and she is good at it. <br /> <br /> The music opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a great-time star. However, the only point in a musical is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus was supposed to be a social satire of varieties, Kurt Weill, composing and Ogden Nash came to write the text, a series of stylish, witty songs and a masterpiece. Without the satire, or the clever songs or Martin (or a similar showstopper), the film becomes just a weak comedy fantasy, how much of the comedy is predictable, and the imagination is being worked to death. <br /> <br /> Not only did movie producers play almost all Weill / Nash songs they brought into the film's music director Ann Ronell to write new lyrics to one of the songs that survived, pervading observation in lovey -dovey romance. Ronell was no hack; she wrote Willow Weep for Me. Wondering what she was thinking of while replacing or tweaking Ogden Nash's clever work. <br /> <br /> The one bright spot in the movie is the Weill / Nash masterpiece. "Speech Low" is as much a love song as anyone ever wrote. It is given one of these ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by Eileen Wilson dubbing Gardner. Dick Haymes contributes with a choir. <br /> <br /> With regard to Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a great music director, as well as composer and lyric author. Your for a song: Tin Pan Alley's women are a fascinating documentary from some of the women who have done it in the industry, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who want to hear how much of the Weill / Nash score was recorded by the original Broadway cast, you might be able to track the One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast) CD. The music is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show starring Martin.
