The movie had moments, but it was disappointing in my eyes. It was a recast of Trespass (Walter Hill) and saw The Sierra Madre Treasure, with less tensions, bites and human emotions. There were some fine actors, but the story was lukewarm and lacked any real depth. I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn, neither was inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for. This movie has been made to death in the past and did not need to be made, eat money that could be used for better movies. For an action movie, it was scanty of action and as a thriller did not tense. Better than seeing snowfall, but not for me.
