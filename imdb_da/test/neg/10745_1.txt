Dear Mr Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, seriously ... the title of the show is "Masters of Horror". And it's like it should be an opportunity to show off your horror chops to show the world why you deserve to be called a "master" of the genre. You apparently misunderstood the exercise. Apparently, you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your attempt comes out as disgusting, overbearing and above all the sermon. The only reason why someone marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the type of people who are not I am not sure about having that kind of policy pushed down the neck. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, give nothing wrong, what you think they think, or I think ... I just want so obvious (not subtle) and unfunny (not satire) messages out of my horror. And while there were certainly other "Masters of Horror" that were big disappointments or where I was just generally confused, why would this director (william malone?) Be considered a genre "master" ... your prisoner far out over the rest for just missing the whole point in the series. <br /> <br /> So next time, please keep your preaching policy to yourself?
