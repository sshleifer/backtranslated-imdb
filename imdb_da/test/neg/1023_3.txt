Fantastic production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney cannot save the curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tales go back to yesterday with three escaped chain-going prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film merges, but never builds any momentum. It gets a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the artistic direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the manuscript (of Coens) is seriously deficient in humor and interest, supporting the cameos of John Goodman and Holly Hunter failing to add any elevator, and the other half of the film slips insecure into complacency. ** from ****
