"Tokyo Eyes" tells of a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls like a man chased by his big brother, a policeman. This lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% speech, speech and more talk. You will see it less than the three star game while talking on the bus, talking and playing video games, talking and getting a haircut, talking and walking and talking, talking on cell phones, hanging out and talking, etc. as you reading subtitles waiting for something to happen. The thin wisp of a story is not enough to support a low-end-value movie, a milder cast and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just incessant yadayadayada'ing. (C)
