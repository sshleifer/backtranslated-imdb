A wildly uneven movie, where the main problem is the unpleasant mix of comedy and thriller. For me, the unusual premise is clearly a comic, and they should have gone to an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some fun lines, but occasionally he's too unlikely for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband gets scaled is too ugly for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preached to us through Freeman's character, early on the situation of the Indians. I mean - gab! They should have given Freeman some fun to say in this segment, but of course it's much harder than just writing him a boring PC speech. There are even more New Age PCs in the form of the end: the girl not only gets the boy - she gets no boy at all; In fact, the message is that the girl has no boy at all! A bit of a feminist statement there. The first half hour is weak, but the movie gets better - ironically - when Zellweger comes to Kinnear. I say "ironic" because I'm not very much a fan of Kinnear, even though he's solid here. Zellweger is very sweet as usual; She has the kind of American cute look that should appeal to almost every guy, and I wonder why several such women are not "represented" today, instead of the dogs that inexplicably became stars like Diaz, Roberts , Aniston, Lopez or Barrymore. As the film tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character, which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker-with-the-heart of gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even far away that they were father and son.
