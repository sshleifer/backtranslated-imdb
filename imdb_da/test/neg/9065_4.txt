OK, so it's about 30 minutes with gore without any history. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. You see three people in the whole movie (who are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. The main choir has no feelings and just reinforces the body for no apparent reason. It's the whole movie. I love to watch very gory movies, especially since in the US real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. So yes, the gore effects were pretty tough. But it's just not worrying. Why does everyone think it is so disturbing? There are no signs at all, there are only 3 living people and 3 bodies. No one has any personality or back story. You see that three corpses have been chopped apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify yourself with death and how it may well happen (despite the fact that the guy loses his job and goes to jail for a very short time after.) To interfere with the viewer must take care and care they must identify with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie, you really need to worry about the protagonist. Here is just a guy and a body. It is as deep as a sausage made from just one rainfall. They never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie. All that is a guy who chops a few bodies, then he has sex with a body. Now with a sex scene, it's a weird thing about what he takes to wear gloves, but doesn't use condoms. So he couldn't care less about catching some weird STD from having sex with a body, but as long as his hands don't get messy, there's no problem, now it's really logical. I don't really like the movie, I liked that it was very gory, but when it ends, there's no reason to watch it again, no need to care, and it's just not a very convincing movie. I say if you can find it for less than $ 10 then you might as well get it, but if it's more than that, it's just not worth it.
