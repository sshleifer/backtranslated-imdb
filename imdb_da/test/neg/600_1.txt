this movie is basically a bad thank you to the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets the twist that tells her to check the kids, she calls the police who track the calls and find who comes from inside the house. When a killer call has a story so simplified, a small child could have written it. Not much excitement, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the movie. In the beginning, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. what about it? the movie is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot of as original as a Beatles concert. Even at low budget slasher standards it is cheesy. Don't waste your time with this. nuff said
