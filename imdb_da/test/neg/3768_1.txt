There is a phrase from experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky who says some movies are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog walking down an alley and sniffing everything along the way. That's how the movie is. The structure is "Kurosawa started as a baby, then he became a child, then a young man, then a film director, then he began to make 'masterpieces', then he became old, The End. The word 'masterpiece' is widely used in this movie to describe Kurosawa's production without explaining * what * makes his movie as good / good. Just because the offscreen narrator reads a script says a movie is a masterpiece, we must kiss his back end and accept that a particular movie is a Of the great works of art of the 20th century, and another point, Paul Scofield's voice is used as Kurosawa's voice when excerpts from the director's memoirs are read on the screen, bringing pearly Shakespeare notes to the text ... but why he? ? If you made a documentary about Billie Holiday, you will use Dame Judi Densch as her voice ????
