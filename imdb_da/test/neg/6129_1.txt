Oh boy, oh boy. This movie is something for the lovers of "real" cineatique art. It makes no sense at all. It's totally boring, especially because of "anti-climaxes". All people behave more than strangely and unrealistically. Sometimes it feels like sitting in a theater, because in dialogues the actors tend to meet the camera (and thus the audience) instead of each other. As I said before, if you are in the more artificial films shown in Cannes - go for it. If you are not, just leave this movie alone, because you will be more than disappointed and ultimately know that you have wasted your time - as I did. Two thumbs down ...: - ((((
