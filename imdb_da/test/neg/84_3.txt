See the title of this movie "Stupid Teenagers Must Die" made me believe this was a spear of some sort. I later discovered that the original title was "Blood and Guts". However, both titles are misleading. This is not a spoof, nor a serious splatter movie. This is something in between, lacking in both areas. A group of teenagers take part in a sadness at a creepy house, and then the killing begins. Sounds familiar, don't. Well, these movies add nothing at all to the endless stream of similar movies. And it is badly made. Because of the lack of light, the whole film is grainy. Now this effect can be very effective, but it is not in this case. The young cast does not play too badly, but the director has no idea what to do with actors. In many scenes, the actors are waiting for directions, but these are too late. It can of course also be an editor's mistake. The signs are unrealistic, and the storyline just sucks. The sound is sometimes awful: Conversations are undecipherable, but when you speak loud or scream, the actors are very loud. It's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still a bad one. For me a 3 out of 10.
