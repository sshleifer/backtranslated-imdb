One day in the life of a dimwitted cab sometime around Christmas: The taxi driver picks up a fare ... they have a "real insightful" interlude ... he loses the fare ... he picks up another ticket ... other interlude .. And then it continues in 90 friggin minutes ... none of that convincing (or interesting) for another minute ... SHIP IT!
