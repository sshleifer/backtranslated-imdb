This movie is a good companion to Blair Witch because it makes so much wrong that BW did the right thing. Like BW, this pretends to be a documentary of ghost events where each member of the team manages his own camera. <br /> <br /> The reality is never there. The participants are poorly written cliché characters, and the events taking place are just as cliché (the cat jumps out of a closet, falling chandelier, etc.). Also the styled dialogue and inappropriate improvisation of the excessively attractive caste deters from the docu feeling. And worst of all, the supposedly held camera for many events is too perfect to be even externally credible. In fact, with some re-editing, this thing could have been a Blair Witch parody. In fact, there is a scene where the blonde historian eats a sandwich with a big roach on what is actually quite funny, as it reminds me of a similar brutal scene from "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". But in the end, the event is played without shock. It's hard to tell what the intent was with The St Francisville Experiment except for joking some scammed BW bucks. But it is pretty sad when the only real interest I could find was whether the blonde historian should have her t-shirt bound by her stomach in a particular shot or not.
