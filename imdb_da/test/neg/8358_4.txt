I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this movie. If she were to be depressed, I think the writer and the director neglected to investigate depressives before making this film because Ricci's character was more of a portrayal of a self-centered, worthless shadow than a victim and survivor of depression. /> <br /> The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I couldn't buy it. This is just for video schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.
