I looked forward to seeing this movie that I didn't really understand how I got the impression I would enjoy. I am afraid that it really is a celebration day - every protector in the cinema I participated in gifts and fidgeted often throughout the film. It's a shame because it's a great story - I tend to think it would make a better reading. It is not helped by the principle that only shows the teeth once - and that was because of the camera angle. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the protagonist's dilemmas. However, the excitement and drama that could have made this a truly high-quality film has been completely spoiled by the tedious treatment. Boring as a half-baked documentary!
