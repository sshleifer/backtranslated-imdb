Frankly, after the Cotton Club and Unfaithful, it was a little embarrassing to see Lane and Gere in this movie because it's BAD. The action was poor, the dialogues were extremely superficial and endless. It was well shot, but then it is again a big budget film. It was too predictable, even for a chick flick. I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die eventually, the only thing I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing worth seeing was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful. But if you want, see National Geographic. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie, this miserable. As far as Gere goes, he is a good actor, but he has movies like this, so I'm not surprised. Half an hour, I wish I could bring back.
