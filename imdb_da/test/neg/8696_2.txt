For a truly wonderful movie, you can also try to watch the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. The best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico scenery, and it will be the movie for a 2nd. I was surprised that these actors did not have horrible sunburn, they were not abandoned residents. And Moses is said to have a speech disorder, but certainly not here. Even the "miracle" scenes were constructed and non-credible. And what is the point if you can believe in something in a TV story? Talk about being stupid, I thought this Hallmark-made movie was pathetic and I can see why others hate Hollywood. I don't, just some of these corporate profit grubbers. You do not need to be any kind of religious to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth", but for this celluloid waste you have to be bored with nothing to do, stupid and religious. And for a real movie experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a very highly rated movie.
