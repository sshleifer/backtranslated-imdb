This movie was recommended, but I'm not sure why. I'm not really and Adam Sandler's fan though, except in 50 first dates where he departs from his usual angry man routine. Damon Wayans is an undercover policeman and Adam Sandler is the guy he promised to be friends with for a year to bust him. Sandler is of course quite angry at this betrayal. Cue angry shouting and stupid faces from the king of black. They end up going, and of course they are friends again after a big misunderstanding (with Sandler shooting Wayans in the head - he survives so that he is Bulletproof). Should I continue? You will find out what will happen if you see it anyway. When our DVD player paused (hey was $ 80 from the supermarket OK?) It was commented that the player knew the movie was boring and refused to play it.
