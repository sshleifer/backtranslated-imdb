I'm currently looking at this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The action is ridiculous. Half of the cast should be retired porn players, and to get kicked off porn you can imagine the quality of acting. <br /> <br /> The graphics are unlike anything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can't even dispose of items for the weapons they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am with the number of "bullets" that their guns can hold. <br /> <br /> If you are asked to sum up the movie, I would say that someone had shaken a group of complete hopes on the local county, beat them on an island, added unnecessarily intense music and let one 6 years old edit. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say no possible explanation as to why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and cost $ 6 from my local video store in one day. If I have something, I have benefited from knowing that I am much smarter than any party involved in this movie. I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew Captain, I wish I knew ....
