When a hard-working entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club, he starts a match between the members and buys it from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns it into an amusement park / golf course where everyone can participate. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a good movie, but it is still a bit entertaining at times. Almost all comedies are cheap slapsticks and bad jokes except Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of its biggest roles as Ty Webb for the second time and plays it well. He is not only the funniest character in the movie, he is the only fun character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humor to this movie, which strives to be a great sequel to a classic comedy, but falls to rubble with others shown on Comedy Central. The movie could have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role, but instead he was reduced to a smaller character and the star became Jackie Mason (who?) They should have brought all the casts back and made a sequel right way ! This is a perfect example of what not to do when creating a sequel to an already stunning movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is humorous, but a big mistake. I do not recommend this movie.
