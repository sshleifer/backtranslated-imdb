While everyone does a decent job in this movie, I agree with the other comment: It's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-less experiment with really talented actors. As such, keeping your attention is not enough. That said, there are a couple of really fun moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a fiery shotgun, which I think someone who has been so drunk would find as much fun as I did; the other is a split second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover makes his usual nutty twitch party guy and does fine, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nutty patriarch (Repo Man, any?). Good cast, not enough to keep it going. Just a few gems, seconds long.
