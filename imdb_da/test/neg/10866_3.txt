Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and not pretty YET in this movie, he's like a drug against the women in their thieves. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been claimed to be sexist, but if any movie deserves the title it is this. I can't even count how many breasts were shown in this movie, probably more than hours Larry Bishop uses to write the script. <br /> <br /> Scripture is ridiculous, bishop and his gang argue, bicycles, party, have sex, kill people, and the next day they argue, bikes, party, have sex, kill people and third day, and you get the idea. /> <br /> I like ERIC BALFOUR and consider what he had to work with, he did pretty well as Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is about Larry Bishops character Pistolero, which is so one-dimensional not even fun. He is also a terrible actor, and apparently he never intends to do the leader himself, but all he asked said no so what should he do? Once he realized that he was going to do the leadership himself, he probably made a rewrite of the manuscript so he could touch more ladies. Although visually a bit beautiful, at least it's biker scenes and Eric Balfour isn't half bad this movie is just a big mess. I never hope to see Larry Bishop in front of the camera again.
