So it's a space movie. But it's low budget. You ask, "What about the effects?" The effects are sometimes good, and sometimes really, really bad. I mean bad. And note I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> There's a story here, but it's told what I think is the wrong order. I don't mean a Tarantino-style wrong order. I think it is told in a completely indecent event. Most of it is about a mother (in the future, because you know it is sci-fi) as told by her daughter, who is mostly prepared in narration from her daughter's perspective. Only when you are through the first hour and hear Paul Darrow's voice as a computer, you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he had read it. This story is so constant and inclusive that the actors on the screen hardly say a word for the first hour. There is also a lesson here for you and upcoming filmmakers: if you do not make 2001 and want some action (this does), then use a good match choreographer. Otherwise, your battles will look good, what's in BATTLESPACE. And note the title has the word "fight" in it. Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think this can be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is watching IMDb note this movie that costs $ 1.8 million. When you compare it to something like PRIMER, which made it better with a budget of a few thousand, you realize in low budget film making, it's all about the story. I didn't expect much - but I was still disappointed. Two out of ten stars.
