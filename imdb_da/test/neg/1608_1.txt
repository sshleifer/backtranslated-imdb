It's so bad I can't tear myself away. I ask myself, "Why?" "Why?" with each scene. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity but then again if you want to make a very overtly gay movie with a fetishist attitude to all things Big, Big boats, Big Boys, Big planes, then you don't have to worry about things like plot or character. I'm baffled and very worried that CAG looks so much like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to put a Pryor look in such a horrible movie. But I can't tear myself away. This movie is the first movie I've ever reviewed. It is so phenomenally bad and bizarre it is. It motivated me to join this site. I've counted 50 main characters. Perhaps if I was stoned, I could follow this, but as it is, I feel like a kind of a never-ending bad dream, where it is always 1988, and we were the biggest cocktry on earth.
