No way! I hated Granny. First of all, she is too tall - of course she is, it is Tom who is the brother who plays her - and I hate the thing she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but: there are fun parts in this movie. Eg. Is the fact that every actor sees V.G. (very German), and also that they believe that even when they are alone, they must pretend that that guy (Tom) is their real "grandmother" or something. I especially liked - not the moment Charlotte leaves and starts going to the nearest gas station to ask for help. She suddenly finds herself in the middle of some forests (where were these before? No one dares to explain) and turns, turns, turns like a ballerina, looks at the stars ... and ... ignores the fact that GRANNY'S BE HERE, READY TO STRIKE !!! But still the music was not that bad, the hair clips were okay, and the end was terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... wish I had the German version.
