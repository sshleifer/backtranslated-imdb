I saw this at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival in September 2005. The description seemed exciting - how wrong was I! This could easily be the worst movie I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see that the director is my age (b. 1948) and lived with Nico of Velvet Underground, which leads us to Andy Warhol, who by chance is the one I was thinking of while I watched this - Warhol's 24+ hour film of nothing Much happens. This is not art, it is boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. OK, maybe ... but what is the purpose here? Surely they had color in 1968! And there is no contrast to the present. And yes, the subtitles were in white, of course. I don't think I missed much, but it made about 20% of them unreadable. Next is the pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events thrown in. What is the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dining table? It adds nothing to the movie. There were many similar scenes - almost like someone taking a video camera and filming random people and splitting them together to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Plot? None. The "uprising" consists of some figures in the distance that occasionally raise a rock off screen. For the most part, it is a horrible long time to see people (in the distance!) Standing around. The repeated opium smoking is just as boring. When the protagonist got a sweet girlfriend, I drove up, but no, she was too boring! This is perhaps the only French movie I have seen where no one takes their clothes off. Probably they were too tired to disturb. <br /> <br /> Romance? None. The girl doesn't really care about everything - maybe her sculpture has interest, but if it does, we haven't shown it. We do not care about the fate of the characters, because they are all unpleasant. Maybe that's the meaning of all this?
