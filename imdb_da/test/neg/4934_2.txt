I had a hard time sitting through this. Each turn and turn is predictable. You're sitting there waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes, that's it! Just as you had predicted at the beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes out. Et cetera. <br /> <br /> Smart writing? No. <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, there is no nudity. Other reviews that call this torture porn are probably written by people on heavy drugs. Unfortunately, there is no torture and no nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no thrill at all in this "thriller". The only good part about this movie is the end, but I'm not going to spoil it. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10. A 1/10 would be a horrible B movie. This movie had better plays.
