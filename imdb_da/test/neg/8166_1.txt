Well, I have only caught the tail of this movie on HBO, just the last 10 minutes or so, but I have to say it probably contains the most ridiculous depiction of distance driving, anytime on movies! I am a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport and I have been through many painful demonstrations in film before. But nothing could ever have prepared me for what appears on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this movie, it literally speaks faith! The portrayal of the runners is even more ironic given that African runners dominate the sport completely, and they are elegant and graceful. The female protagonist pushes together as an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly educated" male followers are no better. Well into the race, this alleged world-class runner is surrounded by pudgy, obese people, many of whom are walks! I find it interesting that the director decided to get her to lead female competition, but near the end she is shown by passing people who look as though they are terrifying at two broken legs! Should we believe that this fantastic star's athlete has only taken over a curly person at the end of the race? Perhaps the instructor reckons that female runners cannot run faster than 12 minutes miles, and he has clearly never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Although you are not a running fan you will be amazed by the immensely inaccurate depiction of driving, and this movie can only be seen as accidental comedy. Here's a note to the director: The next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, it may be worth hiring at least one person who has actually watched that sport in action.
