This movie is poorly written, hard to follow and has poor performances and dialogue from the leaders Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The prerequisite, credible but weak (undercover drug agent subject to the drug underworld) deserved better than this Lili Fini Zanuck flop. The competent beneficiary (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie also features the absolute worst "love" scene in the cinema. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is highly overrated; especially the disgusting, juicy without substance "Tears in Heaven" by the otherwise legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is absolutely unforgettable from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
