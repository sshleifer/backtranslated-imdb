Not a horrible movie - my 10-year-old boy loved it and he would be the target demographically, so I suppose they hit the spot. Pretty boring for an adult himself. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to relate to animated lego characters, even to high-tech ones. <br /> <br /> I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle World was a little weird - unity, duty, and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks they just sound a little fascist? Especially fate. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> It'll sell Lego. Kind of boring to a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertising. Could have been much worse.
