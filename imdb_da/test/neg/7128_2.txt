All the way, though I was thinking of myself "Oh God why!" In the beginning, I thought, "Right it might be average", but plays and plot on most parts were terrible. <br /> <br /> Every part of it was so predictable, though the first movie seemed to bother a lot with the ring, it was a half decent movie, but it just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them horrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, eg. The part that Geller dropped from the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to continue telling me to sit down, and I kept on commenting on what was going to happen next time, and more than once I was right. Why go into the house, get her coming after you? that does not make sense. It was a bad excuse for many kills, and no real depth was seen at all. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that comes, just leaving you feeling there was no point in seeing. Oh shes behind her ... so not that you come * yawn *. Surely these people must have thought about ... oh, I don't know, carry a knife around or at least try to fight back, instead of being eaten, but some hair? At best in the movie I was very mildly scared (and I mean the least), I just cried for the credits when they rolled I exhaled a short "Oh thank goodness." If you don't already have it, don't waste your time and money on this; meaningless, plot less, sorry excuse for a successor!
