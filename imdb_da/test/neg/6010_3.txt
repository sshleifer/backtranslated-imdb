For the producer David O. Selznick no instructor would ever do it. Therefore we get on "Farewell to weapons" (1957) two ?? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although both men were completely executed in their own right, it could also not make the head or tail of this catastrophic remake of Hemmingway's magnum opus. Hemmingway generally has never translated well from book to screen. But under Selznick's zeal to transform it into its next 'Gone With the Wind', the outing is both punitive and exhaustive. At this time in Selznick's career, he was no longer the titan that could take the box office poison and convert it to Gone With The Wind. Tired, fragile, minus his study, and with an upcoming feeling that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones could have been a mistake, Selznick left the creative governments of this flick over to Fox Studios ?? but he kept enough of himself in it to become a disadvantage on the set. <br /> <br /> Now you are or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion must serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondent's tale of romance thrown into good measure. But chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and boring. In the final coil, Jones's facial disorders during childbirth are born so badly that I am surprised that neither director chose to cut them from the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that in thirty-three years she is far too wise to play the optimistic cataract with great conviction. Still, older actresses have managed to make an audience forget about the differences of age. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware that she does not fit the bill in either plays or years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with the stoicism of a soldier whose heart is broken, but his head remains strong. The support noise is whipped with such fittings as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but it is wasted nonsense that in no way reflects the formidable talents of an actor and the best of other places in their guns of filmmaking. <Br /> <br /> The anamorphic image element of "Goodbye to Arms" looks good, though there is a little too much film grain present in some scenes for this reviewer's taste. All in all, the colors are subtle and subdued, even though they are balanced according to the deLuxe color treatment used at this time. Some fading is evident. Meat tones do not seem quite natural. Contrast levels are slightly weak. Black is generally solid. White is almost clean. There is not much to recommend this movie sonically. It is essentially a wise picture with gun shots as background. There are no additional features.
