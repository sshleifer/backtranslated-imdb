As someone has already mentioned on this table, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, director 'distance', a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow' and truly credible performance (aka GREAT acting). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It begins to show its faux hand about 20 minutes of mark (with 60 minutes left to see), and the viewer begins to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen simply jumped too early. But to be honest with Eriksen, his problems started early: he explained in the extra material that he started making a real document, could not get financing and definitely a cheaper way to make his film. <br /> <br /> The principle - people who have secret lives by sending them to a porn site - was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 when the movie was made. Eriksen does a lot of difficult things - a needy host team, cameras with cameras, zooms, grainy black and white - all I think you get a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the credibility of the actors and the rather terrible dialogue.
