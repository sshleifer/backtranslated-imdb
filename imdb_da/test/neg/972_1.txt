There comes a time in every big name actor's career when they become sloppy and accept projects that they would not have touched at a 1000 ft pole in their golden days. Remember "Taxi Driver"? It was a nice movie. I can hardly believe that De Niro in "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I'd rather see "Time Chasers" twice than watching this movie again. If someone offers to take you to see "Showtime" or give you a free pass or whatever, run away as fast and as far as possible.
