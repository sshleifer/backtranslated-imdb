In a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by Myrna Loy. With her incredibly wild hair and voice that sounds very loud and weird, it's hard to believe it's Loy !! She has no resemblance whatsoever to the refined and fun character Nora Charles, whom she played in the Thin Man films. Instead, she overcomes so hard that you would almost expect her to be in an Ed Wood movie. What a big difference a few years made in the quality films, she got as good as her plays! On top of the horrible silly character, the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting - just very, very stagy and stupid. The only thing good about it is Vitafon's sound system - making the sound quality of this turkey the best I've heard from 1929. Heck, it was even better than most 1930's, so the sound engineer has at least something to be proud of - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even the Turner Classic Movies host is referred to as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! And after seeing it, I disagree ... a little. The movie is simply bad.
