After completing this infernal trash, a friend and I vowed a solemn promise to never talk about how we had just thrown away the last 90 minutes of our lives. This movie is completely useless, a two-dimensional hero and heroin that we cannot give a promise of whether they survive and some of the lame villains forever to darken the screen of horror (or any other) genre. To further prove how absolutely pointless this movie was, I would have liked to add a plot synopsis, but I can't write fiction. All in all, the only reason to think about it is that anyone will ever see this movie if they had just murdered their entire community and were looking for a self-imposed punishment that will haunt you for all the years to come!
