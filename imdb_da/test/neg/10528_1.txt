This movie is sometimes a wild 80s college sex comedy, others a cute romantic one ... Then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in lines of science fiction ... It's so uneven it's almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I would hardly rank it as one of the worst movies I've ever seen, except of course for throwing Peter O'Toole. There is absolutely nothing for him to work with here. Poor dialogue, bad ideas to work out, poor everything ... And yet he is great ... There is not a good thing about his part and yet he does it if it is only in pure charm alone. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was so capable of achieving so much with so little shines a spotlight on how much everyone else in this movie failed, making it even worse than I suppose it actually is ... <br /> <br /> If another actor was in O'Toole's role, I would have forgotten this movie as a crap and never thought about it again, but a good performance by Peter O'Toole on Despite all the odds, I can remember this movie for a long time to come ... If only as a movie that might have been good if someone involved in it was almost half as good as Peter O'Toole .
