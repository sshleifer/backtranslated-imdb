I thought it was comedy !! What a hoot! I can't believe that Forsythe or Reynolds would actually appear in this piece of waste. And then there is the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever this eye is called. Should she put a few pounds since her Playboy centerfold .. Like about 50 !! The story is ridiculous, the actor is absolutely horrible, and the tired old clich√© that is run over and over again, boy, it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dog. Worth it was LAUGHS !! And there are plenty! If you really want to kill say, choose a baby half an hour at the rental shop, but be sure to have a room full of brain dead to see it with you. I think that's who it was written for .. it plays as if they were thinking of a really low rent, fabric-induced audience for this.
