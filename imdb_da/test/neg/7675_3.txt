"Oh, you pilots are such men." "They don't call it the cockpit for nothing, honey." Dialogue such is just one of many reasons why The Concorde ?? Airport '79 (or, if you saw it in the UK where it pulled out the heels, the airport '80: Concorde ') became the last and by far the smallest of the series. The disaster film was in dire stretches in the late 70s, what about The Swarm, who had offered very unintended hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, when Time Ran Out and City on Fire just offer much boredom and desperation to find a new one The spin on the genre is all too clear here. This time it is a conspiracy complex, with Susan Blakely's news anchor discovering billionaire Robert Wagner has sold weapons to terrorists and the North Viet. Of course she decides to tell him everything instead of making the story public, but he fobs her out by explaining: "I am a very rich man. I have everything in life I could ever want. Why would I put it at risk by doing something so incredibly stupid? "Just in case she doesn't buy the line, instead of renting a hitman to kill her on the ground, he decides to do things the wise way by planning to destroy Concorde while flying to Moscow via Paris. "I have done many things I have been ashamed of, but I am not a killer," he insisted indignantly on his way to reprogramming a controlled missile to destroy the plane. Saw nothing incredibly stupid there. And when it fails, he sends a jetfighter to it. And when it fails ?? <br /> <br /> Don't even think of looking for something similar to logic here: this is true captivating material that even the studio gave up and marketed as a comedy in the US after the critics laughed it off the screen. Where the three previous entrances all had the appearance of glossy big budget entertainment, this little screen friendly action (the only one not being shot in 2.35: 1 widescreen) may not even make the Concorde look good, which is a feast. Television veteran David Lowell Rich presumably has the right concert because he was quick, inexpensive and had previously directed television films SST: Disaster in the Sky, where Peter Grave's supersonic aircraft could not land due to sabotage and Senegalese influenza (which is not was intentionally at least a comedy in spite of the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the casting) and seemed like the natural choice for what resembles a $ 14m television movie that somehow escaped into theaters when no one looked. Throwing like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars are in a very short time this time around, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded off by rehab clinics and busted sitcoms. Alain Delon gives the Hollywood career the last shot as the pilot, "Happy Fish" (don't ask) George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co-pilot's place hoping to remind people of the other movies while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple veterans from The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), a soft porn star (Sylvia Kristel who tries to become respectable), an Ingmar Bergman regular (Bibi Andersson ?? and she is the one who plays the hooker!), David Warner's navigator on a nightmare diet to be hunted by bananas, the devil's voice (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and her Seeing Eye Chihuahua ("Dohn miscon-screw me"), Martha Raye and her weak bladder, Jimmie Walker play the scissors in her seat and smoking grass in john (in the few moments not occupied by Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson kisses his credibility goodbye as the obligatory mother with critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overhead cabinet, airline owner Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danni ng occupies the best seat in the house, Ed Begley Jr. in goggles and the Russian Olympic team and their beloved coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhh!) on a goodwill tour of the states (who knew about the boycott? ). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to a procedure, Harry Shearer gives a news report in the same notes that he would later use for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlight? In spite of the improvised wedding ceremony during a crash landing, just be George Kennedy redirecting a heat-seeking missile by opening the window, sticking out his arm (almost twice as good sound!) And firing a flare ?? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engine, so there will be no "heat source" for the missiles to home in? Yes, somebody was actually paid to write this and that somebody was the future Oscar winner and scriptwriter of Munich and Insider Eric Roth (hi, everyone must start somewhere), although in his defense was producer Jennings Lang who came up with reason. What do you still expect from a movie that circles stunt balloonists and ends with a shot of Concorde flying into the sunset? Amazingly, in one of them will not admit defeats that studios used to be inclined to, Universal shot another 20 minutes or so a few years later to include in the network television shows (not included on DVD). Unfortunately, his checkout led to the fifth entry in the series, the ridiculous scream that would have been the Airport 1984: UFO, never get off the ground. Even more truly tragic, it was Concorde who was used in this movie that crashed in France 21 years later. (Oh, and if you wonder what Charo says to her Chihuahua in untitleded Spanish when it's not allowed on board, that's "What do you think? Don't worry. When the revolution comes, I promise you will fly on everything you want. I promise what a shame, my love. What do they think they are? "
