I put it directly on you, this movie is dead boring. It's about a flood, that's it. Blah blah a little about family, blah blah politics, blah blah boring. <br /> <br /> Blam all over the weather, bad soot. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a hard ass who expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a most annoying character. <br /> <br /> If you are from the UK or anywhere it can flood, then you like this movie. It is as if earthquake films are most appreciated where earthquakes occur. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie where the weather is the enemy, and you have to capture or overwrite it literally, it's more like a time bomb that needs to be disabled. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, it's understandable why Britain thinks the world is overcrowded, it's not, but for them it is. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie is as exciting as picking scabs and I can't recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, far too long. The problem with the movie; I don't get into them beyond this because the movie doesn't deserve such dissection. Tips for you Londoners - buy more boats. If you bring children to this movie, they will either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons.
