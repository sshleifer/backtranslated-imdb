'A comedy of biblical proportions!' The masters of hyperball, movie-tag-line writers, on it again; The sequel to 2003's Bruce Almighty hardly raises a chuckle. The only thing that raises my interest in this film of total indifference is its dogmatic Christian undertones. Sorry, make it overtones. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel ignores Jim Carrey's good sense of rejecting a retaliation, plays Evan Baxter, smuggled the Bruce Almighty news anchor, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and stressed in moving into the size of a house of Acropolis, the pressure of all change takes its toll on its family. His wife (Lauren Graham), apparently flying in from Stepford, and three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips, and Johnny Simmons) doing a stiff job looking sad at a piano accompaniment, pray for the family to get closer and nearer By the way, Evan does. <br /> <br /> In what is it going to be the biggest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) actually shows up, but making it all pesky 'works in mysterious ways' things everywhere the place by telling Evan to build a Noah-esquire sheets in preparation for a great flood rather than just giving him a pool table or an X-box or something. And in genuine malice style, he also forces Evan to cultivate a beard, long hair and wear worn and tattooed clothes. Nowadays, I was sure that razors were hard to come by, so the beard was inevitable for Noah, but I'm almost sure it had nothing to do with spirituality. Same with the clothes; A massive construction work will probably be more difficult with such impractical clothes. Couldn't God have confronted a pair of steel boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> To rewrite Bill Hicks, I find the idea that God is bringing us a little disturbing, and Evan is doing every step of his way. And who wouldn't? God essentially gets him fired, drives away his loved ones, makes him a laugh and at some point threatens him. Of course, God proves to be right, and the rational, hard-working family who was getting fine, has to eat a large piece of bittersweet humble pie. It's almost like being left alone by God, Evan had to tolerate and humor him. What kind of message is that? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a very commendable environmental slope, with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage done to the world around us. It's also the first movie to ever offset its carbon emissions, and this should surely be considered a landmark in Hollywood. If it wasn't for the trite, disappointing banner of American Christianity flying high over it, Evan Almighty could have been an unofficial family movie with a commendable environmental record. But with its confused religious dogma and relentless 'blind faith' message, it stands as one of the most contradictory films of all time.
