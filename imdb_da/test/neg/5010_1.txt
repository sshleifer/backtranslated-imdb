I tried to see this and was very disappointed. Don't expect intelligent and insightful humor alive Amy's brother David in the middle of this drunk ... it's the polar opposite. But if you are in poop, fix and boner jokes, you come in seventh heaven. This is the bathroom humor aimed at those who have had several bongs that can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as "the best TV writing ever." I suppose those who hate such simple humor couldn't look long enough to care to file a review, but I just send a warning to the ignorant viewers who are looking for high-end comedy. Signs exceed. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laughs are set to zero (unless of course you are looking for juvenile, low-knuckle humor.) <br /> <br /> I made it for 40 minutes and constantly prayed it would turn the corner against worthy entertainment but unfortunately it just got worse and worse. And watch out for Amy's always present and hammy overbite expression - it will set your eyes on. It was great to see the cameos of recognizable comic actors I enjoy, but I can only assume they agreed to participate as a benefit to the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> For those who loved it, I'm sorry. This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
