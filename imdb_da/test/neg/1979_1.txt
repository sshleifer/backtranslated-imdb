Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style over matter gone wrong. Instead of drawing on the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix has spoken a moody montage of incomprehensible combat scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa by blindingly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera's angle to change every second? That Cloud can effortlessly suspend itself in midair for a whole minute as he swings wildly with his 2-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. Although it is not very bad, it is far from well-produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. <br /> <br /> Here's what I'd like to say to those die-hard FFVII fans who can't stop cheating on this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from Square Enix but even a trashy CG flick like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thinking well in advance. Today's news is numbered. <br /> <br /> Films like Advent Children question me whether Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offense) it is a Japanese company. Japanese developers can provide fun games, but most of their offers are disappointingly low. They are complete psychosis when it comes to quality of production. Advent Children has some of the most breathtaking features in CG history, but it doesn't save it from its collapsed plot and cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> Any fan that came with this movie knows Sephiroth is coming back. Bending the story to meet his resurrection was a big mistake. NOTE: The one point I give this "movie" is in honor of the 10,000 unified Japanese animators who gave their lives to make every bleached blonde hair on Clouds amazing Caucasian head.
