<br /> <br /> This movie really has nothing to do with it. With Reverend played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, complaining about his constipation and other toilets in a 2.5 hour movie, you know they didn't do anything at all and abandoned the crap literally. It is a waste of good talent and a general shame. Terrible! <br /> <br />
