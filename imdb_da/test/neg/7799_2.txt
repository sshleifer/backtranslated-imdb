Surrender Cinema has been known for their extremely erotic, almost exact sci-fi movies. While they generally do very well at these (Femalien 1 & 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old ties. Any number of girls - some recognizable and others not - are in this movie in all stages of nudity. There are also several clips from other movies that are excellent unless you've seen these other movies. There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things - some playing basketball, others talking, still others playing with themselves. The only worth in this band is the very first scene - a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and fun Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum. Not highly recommended.
