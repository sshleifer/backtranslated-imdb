This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. Maybe for them it's fun, they might even see something scary in it. For me, the play is poor and the plot is poor, and there is just not much value for the adult viewer. I saw this movie as weak and boring. At times, there was the possibility that the movie might be interesting, but it never really materialized. The creatures look good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they do not seem to have any other substance than the look. At times, I wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy, or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. This movie was just not good for me.
