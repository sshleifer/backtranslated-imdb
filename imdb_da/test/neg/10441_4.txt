The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on Troma DVD is disappointing. This appears to be a censored print for TV viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and parts of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who watched the movie scary would be sour as hell on this poisonous DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cutting. But even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bush ranger life in the nineteenth century Australia. After touring the old Melbourne Gaol, with death masks of prisoners on display, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.
