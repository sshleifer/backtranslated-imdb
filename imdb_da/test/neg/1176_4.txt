I've seen this movie completely confused. I'm not sure if it was trying to be a horror gore party in a Rob Zombie-type affair or a real-life exploration. In both cases, it lacked its mark. It is not very historically accurate, while characters are carved and changed for the sake of history. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither convincing nor bad. For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach, and this movie could easily crash on this route without destroying the overall effect.
