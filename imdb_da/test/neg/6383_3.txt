I know Terry Gilliam is considered a good instructor, but claims that this movie is good, is just silly. What was the movie about? What's a spoof? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer from Gilliam's manuscript. Completely confused and unnoticed hurtling from a historical age to another. I find it fun that some people actually call this movie magically. Is it because they have to praise any movie that is vague and indecisive, what it is about ?? 3 stars for special effects considering it's 1981. Roger Ebert is right in his review. The film is ambiguous and resembles Gilliam's comforters with money to make a vigilant children's movement masquerading as a historical reveal. The movie also tries to confuse the game explorer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery top billing.
