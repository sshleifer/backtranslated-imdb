This horrible act? The sci-fi movie is a crap. I've just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story makes no sense, there are many errors in the manuscript, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown cast is terrible, the leading ham actor seems to be too old for his role. I was induced to buy this VHS, which has a magnificent cover, and see this crap because of the illogical IMDb User Rating and some "ten star" reviews. I just checked the authors and each one has only a brief review ("L.I.N.X.") issued in IMDb and nothing else. Why do they promote such waste? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
