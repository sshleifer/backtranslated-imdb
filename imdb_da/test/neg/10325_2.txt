I give it a 2 - I reserve a 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen movies. We don't even remember what this movie was about. The only thing we remember is a shooting water scene, where the actors fall to the ground, roll to the other side of a time or something, and then you get a recording again. It was like seeing 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform "stunts". Also, when the characters drove in a truck, the engine noise (or the radio could not remember) disappear altogether when the actors spoke. <br /> <br /> And like others, we bought it because of the Sandra Bullock front cover. very sad, very bad.
