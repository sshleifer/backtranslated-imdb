A friend and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It played in a big theater and we were the only two people on the site. It took two days for the theater to stop showing it. It was so bad we laughed all the way through it. Since then, we are considering movies based on Kill or Killed as the worst movie all the time. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's so bad it's fun. It's not worth seeing another look, it's for sure. I just can't make myself give it more than one, because I don't think the movie makers intend to be that bad and I can't give credit for an accident. Pardon.
