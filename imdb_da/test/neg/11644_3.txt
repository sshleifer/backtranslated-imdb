Jim Brown stars and produces a story set in the Philippines right after the Japanese invasion. The story has the Japanese taken several navy men prisoners, including some divers who they use to retrieve the gold MacArthur had dumped in Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> It's a messy movie aimed at making a statement about war and racism (The movie uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle montage). The performances are, at best, just enough. Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show a range in a performance that just has him standing looking annoyed. The sets are usable but seem quite cheap. The movie suffers from the start because of a large amount of stock footage including many of the most famous shoots of the Japanese attack in Tora! Tora! Tora! The use of such a large budget sequence makes it true that the rest of the film looks positively anemic; It also reminds that there are better movies out there that you could see. For me, the movie seems to have a half true plot, the silver download, and a half plot that is just there to fill the time. None of this is particularly exciting even with the explosive final. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I would take a passport.
