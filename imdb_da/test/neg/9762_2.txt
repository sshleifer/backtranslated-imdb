I always wanted to watch the movie because I loved the novel, but was warned away because I had heard that the movie was a stinker. It is. Fowles wrote the script, and I was fine, despite reading the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is execrable - jarring, jangling and utterly inappropriate - breaking any attempt in mystery or mood in the movie. I suppose the director has to blame a lot because even Michael Caine is horrible in it, and he already did excellent work in ALFIE a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The "Mysteries" caused by book are not translated on the screen. I want to see someone repeat this.
