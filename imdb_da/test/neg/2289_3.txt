While some prefer to comment on the value of Bond movies in the context of the learning rate, and while most of the jargon tending to limit Bond to a modest 007 successor has been exploited beyond all reasonable claims, there are more redeeming plausibilities that extend Sean Connery's credibility into this doubling role, which had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance of Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy. Although Connery had been less visible in the latter, his women's searching qualities might not have cast a wrinkle on the face of the angry spectators, as it would in this latest rendition, which to most concerned approached the 007 theme of friendly anger, although overall tastes had been changed. Perfect for those who interest others while failing to be who you are!
