killing moral history of a high school kid, there is virtually the now-stereotype geek. He is smart but has no friends, no social skills and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from HIM. A beautiful girl hits him (he should have known she wanted something - he should be smart, right?). She manipulates the poor desperate fool to write her holiday paper on Shakespeare, as the teacher immediately knows she couldn't have written. He loses the girl (not that he ever had her) his teacher and his college scholarship, all fell. <br /> <br /> Marv is so stupid and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers who run things through the warehouse he is working on. Then the fragile little mud can be impressed and will marry him. Sad, really sorry. Marv is such a pathetic dope (and rather brainless, for a presumably smart guy. I mean trying to steal drug dealers? Has this kid got a screw loose?) That you stop getting upset and get the dreadful urge to kick him in the stump instead. Of course, the girl says her boyfriend about the robbery Marv boasted to her and speaks to him and his friends about stealing the money from Marv and the company. They are trying to do so, and in the process of shooting more people. Police appear at the same time, and the idiot Marv pulled away, a total disgrace forever. I know that this thing was aimed at making teens behave by showing them the consequences of bad behavior, but all that was really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior. Which is the premature end of your movie career, of course. Goodbye, Marv, we really didn't know you. And thank you for that.
