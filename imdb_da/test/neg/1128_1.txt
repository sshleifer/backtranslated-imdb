This must be the worst piece of body I've ever seen. Randy Quaid fun as a supporting actor in the original, but not as the leader. Too much Eddie. The original is a classic. As the original, the supporting actor carried the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He is Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! How Snots still looks the same after all these years, and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older. After 15 minutes watching this movie I don't think I had even laughed yet. The island thing just didn't work. If it wasn't for the beautiful South Pacific women's guide on the island, the movie would have been a total loss. I sat on this review for a week and yes, I still think the movie should never have been made. Let's hope there is no third! Shawn Gearin
