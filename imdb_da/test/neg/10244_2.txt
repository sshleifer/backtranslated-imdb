I'm not a movie snob. I've seen many movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. But I agree with critics here - "Galaxy" is just substandard. Clearly meant to be a comedy, it has only a few scattered laughs. "Galaxy" has poor photography; it has bad special effects; it has some pretty bad actions; and the production values ​​... well, the sets can just as well be made of cardboard. <br /> <br /> "Galaxy" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magic object called "The Blue Star". After a long journey (and some very convincing combat), the crew arrives at their destination, a kind of wild western alien world. There is a painfully unfunny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous "Star Wars" scene), a hunt with rumors, and a final escape. <br /> <br /> Casting samples but not breathing into this turkey. Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done better work in other films. James David Hinton is quite a member of the spacecraft crew. The late Dorothy Stratten stars as the title robot, and while she looks good, her role doesn't give her much chance to act. <br /> <br /> You can catch this movie to see Dorothy Stratten. But if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip this one.
