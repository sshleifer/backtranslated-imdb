Such pain! Pain in the form it had promised in its central idea, but it never fully recognized it and continues to blow much sand into your face. I don't want to say that this straight-to-video South African / Canadian / British horror flick is horrible, but it's just too bland, predictable and just a little memorable about it. It is a guarantee that you forget it, not too long after seeing it. I tried to see it last night, but had to finish it in the morning as I couldn't keep my eyes open. Even then I couldn't remember where I got up, which made me see it from the beginning again. The only thing that hit a chord was Andreas Poulsson's sharp filmography of the big, harsh and eerie desert places. A beautiful glossy chic creates a striking visual feel that cannot save the movie from the total empty feeling. Everything else is under par and almost comes out of the grid. Like the animal's main scraping revelation. Huh. The computer-generated special effects of the vicious monster are tolerable, and there are some grisly flashes of stripped meat and bones. But there is too little, as it does not hide the fact that the clich√© script will consider the generic conflict of character to create excitement and uncertainty. It would be fine if the withered script was more than just basic, shallow fluff, because it never generated any strong, lasting excitement, but made it uninteresting to work on. The main characters are superficial, and the token support falls into the dispensable basket. It's your stereotype group. Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier's performances are colorless and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries, but looks a little tired.
