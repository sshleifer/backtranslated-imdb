WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you are planning to watch this movie, DO NOT! I warn you ... this movie is TERRIBLY boring and basically horrific, not in Horror movie kind of look. I lost this Piranha movie to another Piranha movie, and when I noticed I was making a mistake, I decided to see one anyway. I wish I didn't want it. This movie is so horrible and so unacceptable in every piece of material that I couldn't fear letting anyone say that this movie was halfway decent. For one thing, this movie is called A Boring Talk About Wilderness instead of Piranha. They only show piranhas ONE time! At the same time, the way this movie sounds so badly heard that I got sleepy just 20 minutes into the case. At the end my mouth was open and I stared grimly at the empty TV screen. It is a very badly and poorly filmed piece of junk that I was afraid I had brain failure after seeing it ...
