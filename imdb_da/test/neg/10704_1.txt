I do not think this can legally qualify as "film". The plot was so flimsy, the dialogue so superficial, and the lines so awful that I could not believe anyone actually wrote the lines down, said, "Holy shit! This is a masterpiece" and then actually put it to a producer. I for one is still dumbfounded and will always remember this movie as the mark of degeneration of intelligence in America - it and "Crossroads" of course.
