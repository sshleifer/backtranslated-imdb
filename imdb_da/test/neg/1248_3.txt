20 people rated this a 10! This ballot paper was filled better than a Christmas turkey! Talking about turkey is here a traditional story that hopes to piggy-back at the current pokerville - without success. Told completely in linear feedback, and when I say "told", I mean TALKED TO DOOD, this movie never lets a picture enough when words can be used to exhibit. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's childhood fascination with cards and his associations with hoodlums can sound like interesting movie material, but the director manages to suck his life out of them. At no time did I feel the slightest sympathy for Unger, a genius on cards that threw it all away on other forms of games where he was not so skilled. Of course, as we wait through three musical montages, this leads to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, family events, and finally his redemption (kind). Big gab!
