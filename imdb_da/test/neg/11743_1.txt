A horrible movie, unimaginable and raw. The act of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version, they must be seen as believed. There was no need to make this image, which only highlights how complete and brilliant Hitchcock was and how impenetrable. There is also a creeping, transparent insensitivity in the film that is not there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one could really feel all worried, even the pitiful Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and cowardly humor that remake doesn't have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's movie was the incredible and intuitive depth and sense of shade when to cut away and when to show something, whether to use a close-up or a long shot to make an actor sympathetic and when should he do scary and so on. Remake has none of these properties and does not even try for them. It is an idiotic exercise that I am amazed at even being released.
