I'm writing this when I watch the DVD. I grabbed the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said the show should be good. It has a decent Netflix rating too, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Perhaps on the stage this worked. But I have to say that the sight of the crusader dances and sings quite naked, just seems silly. And the lip sync for a pre-recorded score adds the unusual. <br /> <br /> Most songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. This is my idea of ​​nothing, sorry. The result, so far, is generic, showing melody. Nothing memorable, or especially melodic. Everything is to serve the texts. As I have to say, sounds like they were written by a committee. Each song is essentially an extended joke. If the jokes were ten seconds, they could work. These single several minute long jokes don't. <br /> <br /> Now I see the movie in chapters - a few minutes until I get the core. Kind of hoping that one of them will be different or entertaining enough to keep me from moving on to the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> Okay. I'm done. So here's what I think. If you have any experience or long-standing understanding of musical theater, avoid this - it's just not quality. However, if you are gay and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you may be entertained. Or maybe it would be your interest if you have never seen many attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
