Although this movie's trailer and poster implies that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I couldn't have been so shocked to find that she was just a minor (and I mean less) character if this movie were to be told by Sally's very own family! I think if you want to tell the story of a family member who has been ignored by the story, would you really tell the man who pampered her for obscurity in the protagonist? His other lover (who happens to be white) like the actual love interest? I know I wouldn't! I am as pale as they come and usually a big fan of Merchent ~ Ivory flicks, but I couldn't forget about this film's treatment of poor Sally Hemmings.
