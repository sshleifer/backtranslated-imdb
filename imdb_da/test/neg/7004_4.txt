I ran over Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her movie there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes, of course, she is the person who pulls you in to see this bad movie. Poor guidance. Scenes are repeated over and over with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad chest job, but the other actresses looked good. I like Yvette, but it was obviously a bad choice for her. I can't believe I rented this garbage to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.
