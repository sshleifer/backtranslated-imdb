I really had to judge "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst pieces of boy I've ever seen. The film unintentionally shows those who are the worst aspects of the French, or at least how they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism. I myself am French-Canadian and feel a little ashamed that the creators of this movie are from the same culture as me, it should give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really was! One does not see much of this film as subject to torture. There was a total lack of humor and it seemed to me that the whole movie was a documentary that interviewed people who were neither famous nor talented as if to celebrate something that never happened to begin with. Instead why not see Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three amazing modern French films.
