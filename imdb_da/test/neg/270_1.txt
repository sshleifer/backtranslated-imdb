I didn't expect much when I went out to see this, but my God what a disappointment. The original was fun within that genre, but it's so bad I felt abused when I left the theater. There's no plot, it's not fun, it's not fun to see, it's just embarrassing. After an hour I hoped that my patience would be rewarded, but now I do not regret leaving the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore it, see it when it comes to the small screen. Or watch it on the budget DVD, no matter what you do, don't waste money on it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
