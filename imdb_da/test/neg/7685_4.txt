Ivan The Terrible is more of a filmed stage game than a big-screen opus. Citizen Kane - a similar work in many ways - is quite the opposite (in the way we expect such fare), as it has lots of place shooting for example. It is about conveying a character's motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character, what does it mean how it was done? And in view of the low amount of actions, how else is one to express events that affect history and, consequently, the sign's armaments and decisions, except "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> There is also a historical level why the acting style should not surprise. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the Soviet Union forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films as they knew how. When they were prevented from accessing more modern works that showed the cinema's development and techniques, they only used what they knew. Nazi control of the government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry from the 1920s because of their overall control over the film industry. And propaganda movies can only "entertain" German troops so much; Thus, the need for popular German silent films from the 1920s, for example. So much Ivan's horrible film's techniques would have been derived from such recorded German films that were delivered to the movie staff (as mentioned in other comments). There was no confusion anywhere, and though it was found to be over-hyped, it is by no means a bad movie experience - and certainly not among the worse movies ever. The action is fine and part of the cinematography is excellent (even by today's standards, more below). Absolutely not a popcorn flick; one cannot leave the brain outside this door. Dated perhaps and very symbolic - only worth looking at the big screen if you are not able to watch the movies with the lights at home because many of the movie elements will be lost in these films' primary B&W experience. Everything depends on what expectations you enter into ... WARNING - SPOILERS: Do not read the following comments if they affect your personal view of the movie (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if you don't mind the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan is how Stalin saw himself - evident in his influence on the film's direction (see other comments) - and anyone with a world-historical attention outside the US perspective will certainly understand this. Perhaps Ivan was a former incarnation of Stalin, or perhaps not; This is more a portrayal of Stalin and his motivations, decisions, loneliness, promotions of poor people, etc. - using Ivan's persona - than any true historical record of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of certain colors in the sequel: Red (for the Soviet Union) in the banquet stage. And maybe blue (for the United States) under certain shots when the usurper carries the crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many good visuals such as the deep use of shadows or the external shot of the people who are going to ask Ivan back to Moscow.
