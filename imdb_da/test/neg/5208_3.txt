Nico Mastoraki's forbidden film was quite disappointing in my opinion. The film is about a couple going to a Greek island to kill all perverted people (apparently). You know you have something quite sick when one of the first scenes includes a guy who has sex with a goat and then kills it. <br /> <br /> But it only gets worse from the time when all scenes look pretty much the same. They meet with some people so they either kill or have sex with them (preferably both). The end is ok when the couple turns out to be brother and sister, and she just lets him tear a place but generally one would have expected more. No matter here, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
