This has to be the most horrible abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed. It's simply not fun, and the screenwriters have of course just tried to use the name of the TV series to make a few quid at the box office. This film makes it seem subtle as far as sexually induendo goes (nothing wrong) and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. A complete washout I'm afraid of !!
