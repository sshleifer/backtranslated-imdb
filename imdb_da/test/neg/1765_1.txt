This movie was so bad I thought I'd scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit through it. The beginning of the movie, where they are at war, was promising. Only it tasted of "Save Private Ryan" to me ... or at least an attempt at it. Only we don't care about these people. There was no structure of the characters. The child who dies, I suppose, makes us cry ... but for some reason it's just annoyed everyone. Then we should listen to the line following the line of sappy dialogue, which desperately tried to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which of course was also quoted in the movie. Go figure. There was nothing original about the movie at all. It was like sitting through the most secular parts of every war movie ever made, with a little humor thrown in to keep you hoping it would get better. Unfortunately, it does not. 3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghilla must be shot to try to copy the English patient who was currently a good movie, but now I'm wondering .... should I rent it and make sure I wasn't just caught in HYPE ??? Maybe I was, but I was definitely not caught in the hype of this movie. I really went to the theater that would like this movie. I'm a dying Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh through it as I did.
