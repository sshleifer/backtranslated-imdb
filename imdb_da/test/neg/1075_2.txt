This movie did well in the cashier's office, and the producers of this mess believed that the stars had such good chemistry in that they threw them into the much darker screwdriver, Gazebo. Frankly, I am shocked to see all the positive comments about this ridiculously plotted creepy comedy. Both protagonists have maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. A veteran supports the cast with Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor providing excellent support. And the beautiful cinematography makes sure that the rich landscape of Spain seems lush. And there are four or five really fun scenes to go with two clever scenes and a whole lot of recycled and unfunny clutter. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it started with a kiss.
