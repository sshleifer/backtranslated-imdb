When the budget doesn't allow a Cadillac or Packard or Lincoln or Imperial hears, we speak cheep cheep. It is bird language for cheap cheap. What's in the forty-year-old teenager's boy? The guy who looks like a cement head trying a few times to run over John Agar and gives the only scare in the movie how close he is. His hair looks like a shoe. And lakes. He's a shoe head. <br /> <br /> The nurse woman needs immediate emergency hair washing. She has lacquer in her blonde locks that would ignite if the production company had been able to afford light. <br /> <br /> The monster? The music was scary. I would try to run from the music. The monster probably had better hair than the rest of the casting. Put some lipstick on this monster and you have Divine's older sister. <br /> <br /> The camera's work and editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout. <br /> Hello. Agar? We are thinking of making a sequel to Night Fright and ... Mr. Agar? Agar? Tom Willett
