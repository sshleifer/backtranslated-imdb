Let me first say that I am not a person who usually crawls on the fact of having to think while watching movies, I love Tarkowsky movies, for example, Berghman is also a favorite ..... but this one? The positive points can be summed up easily: the photography is great and the music is perfect .... does it make a good movie? I used to think it, but this is a perfect example of someone who (for me) doesn't ... maybe it's because I'm too stupid? possible, but I do not think so. For example, Tarkwosky also used very long shots, but what he never did was to shoot 5 minutes of the same image of two people who went (and I just mean their heads because in this movie there are many of those shots, but sometimes it is effective), the overall result is simply boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that while intelligent, above all, are very pedantic) <br /> <br /> You also feel always that the director does some of the long shots not to the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to save on the budget .... i'm very disappointed in this movie because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just went over and over again without keeping the same level as in the first scenes. <br /> <br /> While reading very promising comments on this site, I also get the feeling that some people are just trying to see much more in the movie than there is ... when a movie is slow and artificial , it doesn't aril means it's very deep .... yes it's an allegory of musical theory placed in a small town's context that is quite interesting on itself, but it does NOT make a deep movie .... except for people who absolutely want to make some kind of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself .... an exercise that, in my opinion, can be done much more effectively, while watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, who owe much to Tarkowsky, but the cabin is never that level.
