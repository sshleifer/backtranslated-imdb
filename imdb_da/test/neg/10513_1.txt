A dark, yet humorous story involving a policeman who has a first-hand experience of vampires and decides that he should stop working to pursue those evil beings. The majority of the film contained dubious actions, plot, props and movie footage. The battle scenes were like hokey as a middle school rendition of a WWII fight. The lines provided were spoken as if the players had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because they didn't even look like they could work in the smallest amount. The majority of the movie seemed to be shot in some cellars (in some scenes one could see the beams overhead in a scene that should not look like a basement). The reason had no motivation to move forward or go backwards, it just seemed to stand still at times without reason for some signs actions. I sometimes felt the sound effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series. It looks like the movie magazine, being an African American vampire hunter. But this is where all similarities end and the movie looks at a Saturday Night Live spoof.
