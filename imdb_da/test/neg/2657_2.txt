Why is it that such "romantic" movies that never go anywhere, always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? It's not wise, and it makes it look like a bloody television movie. This movie was juicy, slow, dull, unoriginal, wood and I bored? Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude, but he was just a crawling murmuring policeman who seemed to go into Congress women's home as everything was fine when he behaved like a pervert - staring at Thomas with a transparent glare almost Never bother to talk. <br /> <br /> And why the hell are they always British actors putting on crappy accents - they are thrown because they are famous, and everyone knows they are British just because they are famous!
