The suicidal brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother mourn much the same way (by acting), but that father is morose and blames himself. Writer Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn in, signs with question marks hanging over them, and then the whole story - points out the most obvious terms: Suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family Illness! Harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to consider, but then spelling everything out in an elementary, sentimental way. Sigourney Weaver's confused performance as the family matrimony is dry disconnected, and she is a joy - that is, until Harris gives her a makeover (complete with sensible new hairstyle). It is the cinematic equivalent of a discouraging pat on the head. ** from ****
