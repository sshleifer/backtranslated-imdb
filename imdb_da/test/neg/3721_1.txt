Although I do not recommend this movie, I also do not recommend reading this review without first watching the movie. Although I have not given the conclusion, or most of the plot work, this movie will best be seen without prior information. It's hard to find the main problem with the movie Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly appears in his first feature film to have collected enough scenes of youth rage, late night stoner diatribes, self-righteous reasons and unofficial banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenage anxiety dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply disturbing - for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to lead the audience down on past due paths with no sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters and above all the hope that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of uncontrolled loose ends, by Store it under a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The protagonist, Donnie Darko, is a young man engaged in therapy, misunderstood by his friends and made hostile and confused by his suburban life. We are supposed to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes it is a difficult assumption. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory of the smurfs, and Donnie counts with his own theory, his friend complains that Donnie seems "all smart." However, Donnie's speech is no more intelligent than his friend's - just more angry. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his description of his standardized test results as "scary". but given the instructor's inclination towards simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor replacement for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems that are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the whole issue of drugs is discrete, and one of the first chances that the director must redeem the movie is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange fate, the possibility that all this can be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that "science" behind "fiction" is very shaken. The explanations of time travel are weak, which at best seems like detached, uninformed hike. We get the idea that the movie's author once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure it was really interesting and wanted to work it in the movie. As a result, the scientific part is more dependent on expensive computer animations than the actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel tells that if he continues to talk about the subject, he would be fired. No further explanation is necessary). Donnie's conversations with a future visitor lead him to commit more evil actions. The reason for these actions is a difficult business. He damages his school, but it's okay because his school doesn't treat him as a person. His punishment for an eerie self-esteem (something similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in man's public humiliation. But should the public believe that Donnie is a kind of devoted angel who beats ignorance and decay? He himself seems unaware of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Apart from these shortcomings, the film is scratched with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush / Dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film. However, the focus goes on as far as Donny's gruff, blue collar voices for Bush, while his open-minded, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing at all like a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former is not necessary to make a good movie, but the latter should be omitted. Likewise, Donnie's in-depth talk of not being able to lump all human emotions into the boring categories of "fear and love". This does not ask the public to make great strides in understanding. Everyone knows that there is more that two people feelings, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives tribute to several symbols of the 80s pop culture in her movie: ET, Stephen King, Smurfs, Back to the Future. In the heart, this film feels like the director's greeting to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes, and opponents, affirmations and inconsistencies that are roughly sewn together by untested hands. All songs are played in music video format for the character's actions, apparently because the director likes the songs. Signs that have no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bullying, the fat girl and the right idiot teacher) get unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them somehow. The unpleasant mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us asking if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in the head to make another movie, or if he has wasted all his creativity in a meaningless, rowdy, demanding effort. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10.
