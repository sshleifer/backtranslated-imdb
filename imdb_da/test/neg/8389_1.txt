This movie was so bad it looked like a home video. On a scene, the camera slowly and gradually moves down and then moves back into place. The sound is barely and fad occasionally out again. In another scene, the camera man is only visible in a mirror. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene of instructions on how to set up a tent ... which believe me continued for years and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes ended in conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion, these were just to fill in the movie and do it anymore. Even with these scenes added it was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it was the cut head that looked very realistic.
