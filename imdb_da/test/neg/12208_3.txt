You only have to read the cast list and the credits to salvage in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but unfortunately! How so great actors and leaders could have turned one of literature's richest stories into such a monumental BORE, is completely out of my mind. It's great to look at with nice photography, especially the Yarmouth sequences, but JUST PLAIN DULL !!! No need to move on! Skip it and look at Selznick or the wonderful BBC mini-series from the 1980s.
