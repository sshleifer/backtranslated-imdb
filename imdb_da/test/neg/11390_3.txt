Brainy, cross-dressing little boy, finds success in the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. Shirley MacLaine directs and stars as the baby's grandmother, and it is always fascinating to see long-term players get their chance to control a movie, the material they are attracted to, and the actors they choose to work with. Here is the only person thrown in "Bruno", MacLaine. The child's actors seem to have been picked for their glimpses and beauty, and the sharp heart of MacLaine keeps their close-ups for incredibly long periods; Nothing about these cherubs seems natural, not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouth or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. As the boy's unhappy father, poor Gary Sinise floats around the edges, with shame, always with a painful look on his face. Towards the end of the film, MacLaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes, and even ends up with the child who hugs the Pope in Rome! Another rude treatise from a talented actress who is a director who, like Sally Field and her movie "Beautiful", cannot seem to stop blinking and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity to shtick and childhood innocence as a punchline. The kids in this throw throw their eyes, crack wisely with mature comments, use big words - but when a milk-white boy calls our pint-big quite "gay", MacLaine's grandmother instructs him to go over and knock the baby out in front of the media!). What about progression? * from ****
