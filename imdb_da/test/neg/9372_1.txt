Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be the steep center for "Tru Calling", but it is not enough to save her television series from mediocrity. It is a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as Dushku should go from a caring supportive role in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to this clunker. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "Tru Calling" fails to excite at any level above hormonal. The eponymous heroine spends a lot of time driving here and there on what is to be a very small town to avert the death of the beautiful corps, that she has already met in the mortuary where she works. In spite of all the races she comes to, she always looks like she's just got out of a portable air-conditioned changing room. <br /> <br /> In each episode Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast strive to breathe life into the intimate, characterless screens, but it is a pointless exercise. "Tru Calling" is just on the plate and looks lifeless in the ceiling.
