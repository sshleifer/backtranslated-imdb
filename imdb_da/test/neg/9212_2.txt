Very poor quality and the play is just as bad. This film is a good example of today's England and mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this film, nor does the film have any form of scripture Christianity as most people know it. <br /> <br /> I'm also very surprised because this movie is a BBC program and the BBC is renowned for its quality programming, but it seems the BBC's attempt to compete with Hollywood's psycho / drama film Fails completely. Poor action, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion. I wouldn't even bother buying this, rather trying to rent it or buying it when it goes to 2 bucks.
