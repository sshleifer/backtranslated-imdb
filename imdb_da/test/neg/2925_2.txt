The 33 percent of the nations who still support W. Bush would do well to see this film showing the demand for the French Revolution and the terror of 1794 that strikingly resembles the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. Maybe they could stop worrying about saving face and taking a ** whupping they deserve. It is really a pity that when a politician destroys the country, those who voted for him cannot be denied the right to never vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no sense of character. What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character hopelessly doctrinal like Robespierre; a haunted empty man whose simplistic reductive ideology cannot help him clarify the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests exacerbate the hopeless situation he has helped to create. Sounds like all belligerent, overprivileged, retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of? <br /> <br /> Wojciech Pszoniak knocks the dull Deparidieu out of the screen. As sympathetic as Robespierre's plight, it is comforting to know that shortly after the film ends, he gets his jaw shot and sent to the guillotine.
