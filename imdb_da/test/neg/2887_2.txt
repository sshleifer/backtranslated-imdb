Once again, not quite bad enough to make it fun. In fact, this is just boring. It is reasonably well made, although the script is bad, the effects are OK and the working average. (Except for James Mason, who is always great but in this underused one) I suppose it's hard to write something about this movie because it didn't cause any reaction in me, what ever. Dull, dull, dull, dull, boring.
