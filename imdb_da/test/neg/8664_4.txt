In her second half, Mansfield Park is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price is my favorite of her heroes, so I'm sad of the miserable fate she has suffered in her big and small screens. The only good reading of the character I heard was made for Amanda Root's radio, which gave the same quality as she did to Anne's film "Persuasion": a rigorous, secure, hearty moral centering. If the actor was younger, she would also have been good visual casting; but the Fannys who have reached our eyes to date have looked more like each other: Mary Crawford; Ruby the scullery girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial serving wench, or possibly tart, with her high moral principles pulled down a stick. I was hoping for better, but had been feared worse. The series had a solid Edmund, in an actor who was best in similar saps, and the perfect one, ie. utterly abominable, Mrs Norris; otherwise it was dullish. The movie, which was supposedly intended as a deconstruction or another bad theatrical idea, came out as a mixed burlesque. After such disappointments and the recent disappointments of the production sister's pieces (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey") I could not avoid having mixed expectations for this; And on the whole it made me feel a little better cut off than it didn't. It condensed the novel intelligently, and eventually I left much of the same feeling as a cartoon version might have. On the other hand, it was necessary to recast most of the characters, except Crawfords, and at least reminded or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including its most famous character, and what should it be if It's not the most famous scene. The character is the officious Aunt Norris, who is always ready to lead other people in what to do, but always manages to avoid having to do anything of herself; here you get no point at all. And with her much more goes: her remark that cuts through Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas discovers that she has banned Fanny a fire in her room these years and his roundabout excuse her; Fanny is honest in recognizing, during a visit at home, that Aunt Norris for all her mistakes could control the household better than one of her sisters. But then the whole trip is missing from history, and that is most of what is happening at the theatrical performances and most of what discomfits Sir Thomas at his return; and in fact sir thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were. Above all, the scene where Crawford suggests Fanny, one of Austen's most complex, is simplified to a pure tale; Missing from it is Fanny's rigorous maintenance of what she knows to be right and what she knows to be very likely true to all the distractions Crawford and anyone else can throw at her. To a male reader, now no less than when it was written, it reveals with unparalleled clarity - unsurpassed, at least as far as I know - what a woman goes through to try to treat fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to Mistrust It's a brilliant scene in the novel; on television there is only one scene. <br /> <br /> And Fanny, oh, Fanny: When will we see your like?
