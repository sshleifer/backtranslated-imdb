I would love this movie so much ... I really did. But it was a terrible disappointment. I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and was thrilled by the story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books all the time. Remember, the book had much more depth than this movie, in plot and emotional resonance. It worried you about the signs. It painted a complete picture of Phoebe, as opposed to the bad characterization of the young girl in the film. Although it was beautiful and showed * some * promised in its budding career, Jordana Brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just a terrible choice for Wolf's role, both physically and logistically. What an awkward looking couple. Wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character, and more physically prolonged, just as he was in the book. In addition, the chain between the two actors was suddenly forced. <br /> <br /> However, Cameron Diaz deserves the utmost praise for her accomplishments. She took an impossible mediocre script and gave her character life, a true spirit. She is simply beautiful and her meticulous way makes her very credible as a hippie. It's too bad her talent was wasted on this forgettable movie. <br /> <br /> In the Books to Film category, this is a terrible translation, almost as bad as Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner. But let me not start on one ... I am usually not that hard in my criticisms, but I was so disappointed here because I really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right. It didn't ... <br /> <br />
