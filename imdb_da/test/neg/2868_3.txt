I've just seen Fingersmith and I'm stunned to see the average rating of 8/10 for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only was the plot difficult to follow, but sign development seemed to be randomly used. <br /> <br /> The actors were adequate, but in the process of making turns, their characters become completely one-dimensional. When this happens, the story really falls flat and becomes dull. <br /> <br /> And just if anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles away, it is hammered at home in the most banal terms at the end of the movie. The end scene is disappointing and ringed in, and everyone who sat back and went "Ohhh so they were blanket munchers all the time!" Must have been out in the evening. </ p> br /> <br /> Two stars for tonsil hockey in the previous scene, which was at least a little weird, nobody for the rest of it ...
