One should remember that the Gammera films, like many of the first series of Gozilla films, were actually aimed at children. Little Kenny and his cohorts live out of the daydreams of the children in the audience: they run around and play with top secret things while the adults stand and allow it; They come to cavort with monsters, and even when the evil ones enter, they are never in any real danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first Gammera movie is an aberration because the child is punished and endangered, but the rest of the series is pure desire fulfillment. <br /> <br /> As a critic said, these are not adult adult movies but successful children's films.
