Don't be fooled into thinking this is a remake, as this year's recovery of TIME MACHINE is based on a previous movie. It's not because this is a meaningless movie. It's the director used the original camera script shot for shots similar to the "remake" of GET AWAY from a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt to decorate or restructure the original script (but with a director like Van Sant at the helm we must be grateful. He is certainly not Hitchcock) In fact, I am even correct to say the costumes can be the same because the private eye carries a pig cake hat. Weren't they in fashion at the end of the 1960s? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Avoid
