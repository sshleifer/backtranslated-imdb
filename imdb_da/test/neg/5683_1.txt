I had never heard of zero budget "auteur" Neil Johnson before I saw "Battlespace" on DVD on Hollywood Video. A few minutes into the movie, I realize that this is not a bad thing. Like many straight to video Sci-Fi movies, this is a movie dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that do not create a story. Viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a story by the protagonist's daughter. For me it seemed like a smoke screen to mask a movie with military ugly visuals and zero character focus. Some people here seem too ready to take this movie seriously and swallow the seemingly new age line hookline and sink. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can immerse themselves in thinking that things like "Battlefield Earth" were a brilliant movie or that Shasta is as good as Coke. Those who were enticed into the cheesy cover art can look forward to miserable plays (in small doses separated by long blocks of people who don't speak), rat computer animated effects (in extra-large doses) and annoying talking computers. What you don't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue, or a good story. "Battlespace" is impenetrable bull and the constant annoyance of the story proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real film production is all about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and boring predictions. This is just down the line directly to video sci-fi such as "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If boring Horizon's boredom and "Alien Visitor" is something you seek out, you have to see it all out. If you enjoy a good storytelling and hate fake lenses, you are better off with a real movie.
