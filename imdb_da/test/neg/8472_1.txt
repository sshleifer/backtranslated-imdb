I spent nearly ninety minutes through this terrible movie waiting for a revelation of dance or spirit or inspiration or something and abandoned! What did the filmmakers do about this? This is an old woman with limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill a story without a point, we get some things about the other people in her thrall, her help with the burros, and of course her ten cats! Don't watch this movie. And have no more to do with someone who loved it - they have no idea. There are fascinating people in this world with amazing stories to tell and insight to share - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I took to this movie say they have forgiven me - but they will never stop fooling me about it.
