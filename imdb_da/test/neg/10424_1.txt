This could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! I had this movie when I was a theater director. When I put the film together and looked at it, I thought I had some wheels out of order. As it turned out, I didn't, and if I did, no one would have noticed. I couldn't figure out what's going on! Everyone who went out felt the same way!
