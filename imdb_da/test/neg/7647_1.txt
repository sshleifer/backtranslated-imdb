Honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies I've ever seen. Seemed like a movie for television. And badly know it. I can't believe people are still hiring Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie or that they still allow John Sayles to make movies. My husband and I came across this movie on TV one night and got so sad we ended up cleaning the house while it was on. . . and it still bored us! It has made me believe that critics have been as credible with Sayles' former films as Lone Star, which was raved about in time but not really added too much in the end. Spend your time on something better. Anything.
