I'm not sure this movie could ever match the first, even though it was in the original seven (despite four being killed). It just doesn't have the spark and the chain. All the actors seem tired and look like they are just going through the movements to get their pay slips. It is interesting how Yul Brynner is "magnificent" in the original film, but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel. Nevertheless, when his stars in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s his character (in the same matching black pants, shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 film Chris Adams. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth seeing even on cable.
