I realize it's a small statistical sampling (8 votes from this post) but 5.9 out of 10? I give this movie a 3 and even it is generous. I have been trying to watch this movie three times now (Saturday night at 9 am premiere on the SciFi Channel and Saturday night at 1 and Thursday evening broadcasts) and I have fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends. Which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen, who strapped for cash, that he should continue to play supporting roles in these frightening "Pumpkinhead" followers? Is Henriksen contractually forbidden to make any "Pumpkinhead" film? Can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster resembling a geriatric, emaciated "Alien" that goes as he has a stick attached to his **? When will the hick characters in these movies realize that small arms and rifles don't hurt "Pumpkinhead?" Why don't they try to stick another stick instead of this thing? And finally, the authors of this movie are so creatively challenged that they couldn't name the two sweeping families more original than Hatfields and McCoys? While you are aware, why not write a manuscript about a fictional president and name him George Bush? Today I can get the mental endurance to see this movie all the way without drifting to sleep. Until then, if anyone has the answers, let me know.
