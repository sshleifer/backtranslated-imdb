"The Next Karate Kid" is a thoroughly predictable movie, like its predecessors. Its predictability often results in a sense of impatience on the viewer, who often wants history to move a little faster. Despite its lulls and its extreme confidentiality, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively due to Morita's presence. He doesn't seem tired of his role, and he injects some life and humor into the movie and becomes the best reason you see it. Not terrible, but not much.
