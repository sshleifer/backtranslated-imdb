I for one actually expected this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a little too high, but I love Judd Nelson. In fact, he is the only reason why this film is worth watching and really his role is not so great. The main highlights of this movie are furious sex scenes and dull dialogue. If that's the highlights, I'm sure you'll get a good idea of ​​what kind of movie this is. There is certainly a reason why this was a made for television movie. Only watch this if you have nothing better to do on a Friday night or just waste money on video rentals. Save your time and rent the Breakfast Club!
