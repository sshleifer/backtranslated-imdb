This mess begins with a real tank running over a car, interkut with pictures of a toy tank. This is followed by a family who goes home from a birthday party without saying anything. The inexplicable tank and the untalkative family pick up, I swear over a 10 minute movie. Finally, the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities, only to discover that the city's citizens are hiding in their houses and the police are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the city's folk music comes out because of the family's presence, we learn that both the author and the editor are confused to replace excitement with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hope that the audience cannot tell what is going to somehow bring turmoil on the audience ... and it works! ... but not the way they thought it would. I was very worried about how bad this movie was, but not scared at all. The dialogue consists of things that do not make sense. Not in a fun David Lynch kind of way, but a kind of in-walked-under-the-middle-of-a-drilling conversation kind of way. During the next hour, we learn that the filmmakers are trying to drill us into being scared by showing boring everyday scenes combined with the above "what happens?" type of scenes. The plot implies something like gently-looking old people who put children in trance through Satan's power and then bring them to a party to play with toys and an even more vicious intention, and it is up to a group of white men (all white in the movie) to grab their weapons and save the day and a long, long eyeshadow woman who whines on the drop of a hat. They look for the kidnapped children by looking at random places and shouting over the children's names. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is afraid of the mere thought of satanism, paganism, wicca or even Catholicism because of a lifetime diet of brainwashing from Trinity Broadcast Network. This represents Satanism as older people in Halloween costumes with candles, while mingling at a party, in front of an Ankh. Fill with a priest who completely sprayed on nonsense about Satanists while calling them "witches". The message that something that is not Protestantism can all be thrown into the same category for easy condemnation. About 30 minutes of recordings are wasted to show mediocre older actors scary babblending overwhelmed pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not consist of words. <br /> <br /> The highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of ​​little green men for a solid 3 minutes, a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak. A priest studying Satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-so scary drawings of demons to scare the Lady Lady Church. Random shots of dolls. Random shot of children. Paint instead of blood at every chance. Film school level dream sequences. Introduces insignificant signs that do nothing before leaving. Sometimes they seem like nothing they do is a big thing. The management is at best sloppy. An example of the instructor includes a scene in the beginning, where a man and woman kisses and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes, and a dark red paint comes on her cheek. When they look up, they see that it is not blood, but drops from a girl's snowhead. Snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have produced drops of the same texture as paint, not to mention the fact that her snowcone was a bright red-orange. Hackneyed wrote for sure but made even worse on the bad track. It then cuts to an alternative shot of the man, the woman and the girl and shows that she stands about four feet away from them, so that the snowman would not have dripped on the woman, even though she had held her snow above the woman's face. The way to go, editor! Of course, the play is blah. The cast of the whole cast can be put on a scale and perfectly balanced between overactive and inactive. <br /> <br /> The conductor's most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the flashing eye of the camera teacher as the actors do by themselves. <br /> <br /> And finally, when we come to an end, it would have been good if it had been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.
