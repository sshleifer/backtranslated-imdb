Well, I've seen the anger of the ninja. It is not something I would recommend to people who are not seriously into Japanese combat films. This is a kind of Japanese campaign nominee movie with a complex plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "sorrow values". I saw the subtitle version (NOT recommended by the way it's easy to miss something) and I didn't really follow it all. It had some good scenes hard, but generally it wasn't much in my opinion.
