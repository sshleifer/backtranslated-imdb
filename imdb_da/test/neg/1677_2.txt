This movie over does it on cgi I mean sci-fi really they made it the original '' BATS '' is better it doesn't use cgi as the sequel. in this movie are the simple people running from mutated killer flutter. and real bats in Afghanistan?! the plot involves u.s army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attacked by bats and dying <_ <but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers. The play is bad and it doesn't even look like a horror movie. Throughout this movie is a pretty good TV movie for the sci-fi channel. But if you like sci-fi movies, you like this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie, don't be surprised. oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead.
