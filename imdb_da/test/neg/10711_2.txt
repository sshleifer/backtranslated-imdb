The actors are asking for a huge suspension of disbelief, you give it to them in the hope that they will convince you for a moment that it is possible. Unfortunately, with television films, it seems that they have specifically decided to make cheap Cosmo questionnaires. With a small budget and big demands, you need to spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The movie gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies oppose the odds, but unfortunately it is not enough to save the day. Oh, and the less said about the end the better. Merry movie viewing by everyone!
