Living in Edinburgh and having a great thirst for history, I was very discouraged by the "libertys" taken. Wrong dog stroke for a start !! Bobby's owner Old Jock was an old single man who came to Edinburgh and died a pauper in lodging, not like the movie at all. For anyone coming to Edinburgh and hoping to see the sights of the movie, you won't find the cemetery in Princes St Gardens !! There were a few moments when a tissue would have been good. The actors were amazing by elaborating on a rather flimsy script. I do not feel that the poor thugs Bobby actually got enough screen time, possibly due to being "lost" at some point. All that, the movie was fine, and every 8 year old will enjoy.
