"The beautiful country" is a big disappointment. It does not meet my expectations. Bihn, a tall muscular guy, is the son of an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during Vietnam War. We were told he was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early 90s, so he flew to America to seek his American father. Sounds like a heartbeat material? Maybe, but show in this movie. I find it hard to connect to Bihn emotionally because the movie is full of clich√© and I simply don't understand or believe in him. The printer of this movie is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. It takes some events on a necessary basis and tries hard to touch the audience's feelings. We are not so stupid and it does not work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So you don't feel Bihn's boat trip (yes, he was on a boat!) Is hard enough, let's have a storm overnight and let the ship shake a little. Still not touched? Lived! Get a young child to feel the heat, the hungry, the disease, the violence with the adults on the boat. Hopefully it will do the trick to touch the audience. Still not touched? Your heartless SOB, let's ... OK, I won't give any spoiler of the movie, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is really long and slow. It never tells us why Bihn did not go to find his mother and father until the moment he left to watch his mother and father. What did he do the 20 some years before he went to Saigon to look for his mother? And guess what? He has luck and everyone will tell him where he finds the person he is looking for and he finds someone without scratches. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should hire the Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which one? Both Vietnam and America seem hell to Bihn.
