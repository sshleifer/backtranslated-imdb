It is the best movie that primarily takes the sick and helpful movie ever made in this poor country. really your people do not even know what the word cinema means and you voted for movies, i am really curious to know how many movies by P.P.P. or L.Bunuel you've seen. The result of this "faield experiment" reflects much of your way of understanding things and recognizing a good / quality movie when you see it. We the Romanian people have only one movie, and until today the status has not changed and that movie is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I do not lose the time when many of you have seen it. It's a movie that respects all the required quality of a MOVIE. From the script to the frames and even to the image's quality / clarity, there are even over 41 years of age. I recommend to voters to search for better movies and then vote. KuDos will see you later.
