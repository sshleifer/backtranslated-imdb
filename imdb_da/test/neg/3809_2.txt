This movie is one of the worse examples of hype. People who read IMDb comments may be tempted to see this total waste of time as I was at fake tag lines like "A throwback to 80's horror" and not. This movie sucks, from acting to leading to history. Terrible, across the board. And I like good horror movies, I'm not a snob at all. This sucked. For reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre The Beginning, The Other, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror and Really Hated The Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Make) Wolf Creek , The Hills has eyes (re-make) Hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore tromper not fun or originality.
