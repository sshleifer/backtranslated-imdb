those (dueringer, dorfer) are good stand-up comedians, young, not ugly, have money, the girls love them, the audience is appreciating everything that does <br /> <br /> and then they made this movie ... <br /> No history at all, some jokes were old in the fifties, the play is terrible. Save your money for something useful as a gift for your girlfriend.
