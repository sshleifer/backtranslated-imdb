does not mean that this movie is good. I was really frustrated at it at many levels. It's a bit of the top of the bukowski hat. Hi, I've read that guy in college - let's see what Matt Dillon does to him. and i like matt dillon. I thought he came close to looking a little like a hank, but mostly just the reddish cheeks. I have to break a sign, and there just wasn't much to worry about. I think time can be cruel to bukowski, and that bother me a lot because the writing was solid in a kind of post counter culture time. hard to sit through, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me throw up. I ask for very little, got less.
