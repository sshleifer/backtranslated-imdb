I went unwittingly into this "trap" of a movie. <br /> <br /> If I could return time or just get a refund, I'd be happy. It was at. 19:30 and Cinderella Man did not start until noon. 22.00, so I hurried into the theater to catch the movie that started at. 19.20 ... and I dare say God reached out (or pulled it back) and allowed me to punish me for my movie gap by sitting in for this movie. It may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted to my heterosexual male cohort, but there is no excuse for miserable sound and video editing. This movie was highly worthy of a high school project budget ... and I think I've seen better in the acting French shorts that we used to do with Louis Laloupe. Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this movie was for LA fudge-packing crew and their sympathetic ladies. The way was me when I realized that so the whole audience saves me blown up all the jokes and anchors ... I fully understood the hint of humor ... but I just couldn't relate. <br /> <br /> This show did show me, apparently, how gay men date and build relationships. But even though it was their purpose for the movie, I feel that "Gayness" was focused on too heavily .... humanity seemed lacking .... but again, maybe it was meant ... simply to be avant-gard. .. and to make a splash. <br /> <br /> I believe in low budget and poor equipment, make your movie as "high" as possible to get the crowds and money back. I really wish I had just read my Sheldon Van Auken instead. Hehe ... I was the wrong audience.
