This movie is over hyped !! I'm sorry to say that I can see the first 15 minutes of this movie and something beyond that, I have to force myself really hard to see the rest of the movie. It is quite stupid and very false. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing these clothes and the play is really bad, especially the one playing the Alien sign. He is totally annoying !! Don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I'd rather sleep or spend my money on something other than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible I would give 0.
