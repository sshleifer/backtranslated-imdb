The most obvious mistake ... horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was destroyed with poor dialogue, continuity issues, things never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the horrible, clumsy rule of Sandra Locke. Not even two amazing performances could have saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette are giving horrible beliefs. The thing is, they are better actors than this movie would have you believe. The best of Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperate Seeking Susan) has some nice moments - as a fantastic scene at the beginning when she painfully pulls her handcuffs away - but gives a general weak performance by her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick when trumpets fade and the glorious My So-Called Life) are much worse acting without conviction or emotion, anything. But I will not blame the actors who have been good in other roles. Scripture is horrible and the bad direction doesn't help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
