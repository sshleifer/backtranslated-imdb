Like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this movie cannot tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism. No structure at all, just throw naked women on the screen; no it doesn't work like that. If close-ups of female genitals are not your thing, prepare yourself to look away from the screen at many points (I often did). "All women are at heart" is the mentality of the movie offensive, and "story" is, in turn, absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). But halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nothing and involves one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a key wrestling match that she wins with a few judo movements . Although the choreography of the battle is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. In fact, the scene and the fine filmography are the only two reasons I give this movie * out of 4, instead of 0.
