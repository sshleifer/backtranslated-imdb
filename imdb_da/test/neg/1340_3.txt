I joined this movie with a little trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting, and unfortunately my fears were realized. This is a humorous piece of work, and I sat in the theater waiting for humor and humor to begin. I'm still waiting, it works. Updating the history of today's time just didn't work, and the change of character an absolute travesty - why Bette introduced Midler's character as she disappeared as fast as she arrived; The related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot. The women at the cinema laughed a couple of times, but nothing touched me as fun except for a line from Meg Ryan who spoke to her mother about her situation and told her that "it's not like a 1930s movie - I wanted to much like i was the version of the 1930. It was too drunk feely 'sisters stick together' and really need some of the harder white and clever dialogue from the original game. I still see the original movie and download a line as I have never caught in. There is no sense of closure for this new version, and while the 1939 movie is politically incorrect according to today's standards, each thread was tied and when the movie ended - made it so strong. a warning for all viewers - if you know the original, do not bother: I felt cheated by losing a portion of my life in a movie theater that looked at this eerie piece of fluff, bring the jungle red !!
