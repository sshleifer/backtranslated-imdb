I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. And that doesn't say much, because I consider myself something of an aficionado when it comes to crappy movies. But this is beyond bad. This movie is so horrible that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I just want to ramble on a few of the points that sucked. First, CGI must be one of the worst I've seen. I can't believe this movie was made in 2005, reminds CGI of something I might have seen in Babylon 5 way back when CGI was new and fresh. It is poor outside of faith. Secondly, the actors seem as if they belong in the worst kind of daytime lapse. And when they look at their resume, I see I'm real ... Third, it's not possible to breed huge reptiles for the other technology they invented in this movie: the recoilless gun with infinite ammunition! Michael Par√© seriously burns 100-200 times without reloading in every other scene ... As if that wasn't enough, there are also shifting planes! Initially, they are regular F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something completely different, and in the third scene they are F-16 again! If you buy stock footage, do not mix it like this! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there is plenty more to say but I think I stop. You all understand what I say. Honestly, I didn't think this kind of movie was made any more. It's like something Ed Wood would do. Totally ignorant of quality, no matter how something looks ... It is almost amazing in all that is terrible. If I could give it 0/10 I would, but 1/10 is the lowest class. So that's it.
