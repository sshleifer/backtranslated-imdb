Sometimes you just need patients when you see indie horror. If you can just tap your way through the slow early stages, sometimes a real gem will show itself ... Unfortunately, this was not the case with "Satan's Whip". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" is trying to pull us together on a boring snowstorm in a movie, with no real payout at the end. I guess the black and white (and blue) filmography should have been for a reason, but it never explains why the majority of the blood is blue and I found it increasingly annoying when the movie continued. The story itself is not that bad and actually had some originality and decent content, but the play is simply pathetic. This combined with slow pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made "Satan's Whip" one to forget quite quickly. I will give it a "4" rating for some witty dialogues that made me chuckle, but alas that couldn't save that boring waste of my time.
