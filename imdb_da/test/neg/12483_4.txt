Hoping from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating Fulci movie I've seen to date, and I encouraged myself to join horror fans who generalize that his movie gets worse when you later enter his career . Considering plot synopsis, I expected a little bloody bad nature with this, but for all its bizarre blooms it feels boring even on a driving time of just 80 minutes and suffers from unpleasant shabby production values ​​and movie-making craft (or lack thereof). El Story: A gambling addict widower wine and your rich (and strange) women find him through lonely hearts columns before they make them cruel - sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals - and stealing their money to break their debtors . Of course, it is unlikely that only one man would host so much turned up pathology at one time (abuser, psycho / sociopath, cannibal), but this is Fulci! In fact, Touch is the cheapest and most economical look I have ever seen. There is almost no one in it, even in the background of shots on the street, for example. A news reader who continues to appear on the film's TVs to warn the non-existent cast of the maniac's recent actions, operates out of the most pathetic television study on the planet. He never even gets to look at the camera because he has to read all the headlines out of incorrect paper sheets. <br /> <br /> Some scenes just go over and over again with the protagonist mumbling for himself about what he's done or what he's about to do, but the play isn't so good enough to sustain this kind of thing so it Main result is seer boredom. The film also looks gentle and ugly in general. I've read that it was supposed to be an Italian telemovie (shot it ever in that location? With the amount of gore involved it seems unlikely) and it comes from crappy old telemovie production values. <br /> This is also Fulci's first foray for all black humor, but he's just too graceless a director to make it work. Sometimes there are strikingly cheerful or "crazy" music used to play against a cruel scene, for example, while the hero / villain deepens a dead body in his basement. The effect is not really chilling or fun or ironically something that you would like to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy. Of course, there are some redeeming moments of gore (that you will be waiting while trying to keep you awake), including any murder by the stove (!) Of a woman who just won't end her life even after her face has become completely tied up with a bloody big club and a homeless guy who gets a car back and forth over him about five times. The most outrageous element of the Touch is, nevertheless, the physical deformation of the widows to whom the crazy guy is entitled. Carriers, hairy moles, messy harelets - it's not like he was looking for women with these features, it's just the way every lonely hearts widows seem to be. There are lots of shots from Mr Crazy secretly grimacing as he tastes these women. The black humor of such a garish misogyny may have some staying power or resonance if the film was not so badly executed in general. Finally, Touch Of Death just seems like a really stupid, artificial mess.
