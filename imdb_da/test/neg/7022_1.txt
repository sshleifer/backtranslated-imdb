Lucille Ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but she still made an occasional film, especially LONG, LONG TRAILER and LIFE FACTS. Although her television career was strong, the 1970s began to see her movie career lie down - but Ball was determined to have a last-minute screen capture and the project she chose was 1966 musical MAME. <br /> <br /> In many respects, the role seemed tailor-made: Based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a crazy, wildly uninhibited woman who "inherits" her orphan nephew Patrick - and lead him on a wild ride in the possibilities of life, jumping from one cartoon to another. The music that included songs like "Open a new window" and "If he walked in my life today" was among Jerry Hermans best work. The support cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; opening of night fanfare was huge; the movie was a disaster. The critics were horrified and the audience sat slack-jawed. Whatever hardcore Lucy fans can say, MAME is a failure, so much that it's hard to know where to start. It is badly directed, poorly filmed, poorly executed, and there is Lucille Ball at the center of everything, unable to dance, unable to sing and grin like a waxworks dummy, while incredibly poor choreography swirls around her . But the disaster is hardly her to do alone; They do not support throwing prices better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their scene role by Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; The former is stadiumy, the latter is bleak. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he is pretty much alone and clearly not too happy about it. <br /> <br /> The DVD brings the movie from the VHS pan-and-scan release to widescreen, but that just means it's more horrible to see. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME; While I wouldn't say it's bad enough to make you throw your eyes out, you may wish you had it. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
