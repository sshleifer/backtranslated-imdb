It is difficult to build any enthusiasm for this horrible cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. It certainly cannot be because of the all-art look of the set designs or the noisy behavior of an all-star cast. These days it is all too often shown on the Fox Movie Channel or AMC. It makes me guilty of reporting that veteran actors such as Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine themselves are thrown into this confused science fiction travesty, of which no one is rightly calling. It's like seeing an expensive budget spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialogue. It's a cartoon version of Jules Verne's novel. <br /> <br /> The mature Fontaine was still attractive but has a painful expression on her face, perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the manuscript. She contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role, but an imperial and unpleasant presence and looks quite out of place most of the time. Faring no better is Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and - most of all, Peter Lorre - as well as Frankie Avalon, who gets to sing the title melody, which - it is safe to say - was not a favorite title tune. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience of sitting through a movie like this one wasting an attractive throw and being an insult to almost everyone's intelligence. Completely unconvincing from start to finish. The movie, as well as the amazing submarine, sink to the bottom of the ocean long before the battle with a rubber squid brings the movie to a dull conclusion.
