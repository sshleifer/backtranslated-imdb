What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square meters of remodeled old Rome, 2 million cubic meters of 50-meter tall buildings, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of work, an International Ancient History Committee (sic!), Some first-class actors and actresses. The final result? An empty TV movie for a single-digit IQ participation.
