Parts: Clonus Horror is a horror okay. There are of course the bad fashion species in the late 70s. There is the really bad action by Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. Their days consist mainly of running, jumping, cycling and wrestling with each other. When they do not, they learn about America. Not the band America, or the song by Neil Diamond, but an America where they continue to become part of a larger community. But they get some weird stuff so they all have their body fluids drained (General Ripper was right!), And they are placed in the freezer and await Thanksgiving or Christmas when they are thawed and burned at about 450 degrees or so. Oops, that's not what happens, but it would have been much more interesting than what is shown. Mario, of Super Mario Brothers fame, makes a nice cameo as a doctor who bickers with Dick Sargent.
