There's something about a movie that contains female bodybuilders who get me in front of the screen every time. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Pumping Iron II", "Esser: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk" and even the television movie "Getting Physical" which contained some big names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own ways (mostly because they contained Rachel McLish. ROWWR !!). <br /> <br /> Then I went to look at "Nemesis III: Prey Harder" solely because it was such luminaries as Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. Love the ladies, always, but after that I am a bit happy that I missed the first two "Nemesis" flicks. <br /> <br /> Well, the first one, anyway. Most of the footage here is lifted bodily (and kicking and screaming, I will guess) from "Nemesis II". In fact, the one who was marginally entertaining saw the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But even though price and company are flexible and make up, they don't get much chance of doing anything else (such as ACT!). In fact, this whole movie is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha ...) in oblique storytelling, ambiguous characters and open film making (both film and story). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes sense, but even if it did, there would still be problems - such as to make such small parts for such larger than lived women like these. What a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what do you expect: cohesion? A star only in view of all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev put into their bodies, NOT "craft" work done in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Thank you, ladies.
