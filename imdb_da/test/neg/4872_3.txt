They do too easily in this movie. It reminded me of Indiana Jones, where he hides on the outside of a submarine during a sea crossing. Everyone knows everything that happens, it's just really easy to get anywhere you want in the White House. I don't even know why I saw half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from all angles and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually it's faster than a car in a garage or an ally). It was stupid, for the most part, and I didn't even know, had a ten-story lift in the White House. Anyway, something conspiratorial is always interesting.
