Okay, so I chiller in my room when mother knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it should be an older horror movie, because there is now someone who might be stupid enough to name a movie that after The Blockbuster hit "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. It alone should have stopped me from putting it in V.C.R. But no I had to take a chance I had to believe that this movie could have a little ray of hope. Little did I know that the rays were not there to see. <br /> <br /> Number one, the story is so ridiculous that it is probably true in some countries bumpkin town. Two, the actors seem more like people real life people who just happen to wonder about the set when the director shouts cut. Three, almost any movie starring, is always horrible. But the funny thing is that this is another movie directed by Kevin Summerfield. I have been relying on his movie to bring me to the floor with splitting laughter. <br /> <br /> Where to start with this movie? I know let's start with the jogger in the woods. The camera's lighting was so bad that I thought the jogger was standing still and the camera man was running. I love how the woman stops eating a candy bar. I think it's just about dark, or just about light that could tell with the camera's lighting. And she stops running to eat a candy bar, I mean a CANDY BAR WHAT HELLS. Then she stops being the first victim because of stupidity, and I'm already ready to break the tape, find the instructor, burn his small hands. <br /> <br /> So by no means can some guys try to fix a car that is likely broken for some years now. Then comes the fake Mack 10 and a very real prostitute who happens to be part of our main charter cast. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie is about a group of children who are all in trouble. And get the opportunity to pick up waste in sleepy park or face suspension forever. There is sent in the woods with one of the teachers (Mr.E or aa Kevin Summfield), who supposes to look over them and make sure everything goes well. The funniest thing is how undeveloped the charter really is. I mean what's with the fake Mack 10 guy and who ever heard of Hacker trying to kill himself. And some how one of the students has had an affair with the teacher Mr. E before all this community service had even come up. But the school still thought it was a good idea to let him go. There is also a student named J, whose purpose of the movie is to keep annoying popping up out of no where trying to get the audience jumping when all he really does is add to the fairness of fairness. The sound was so horrible in this movie. I think there was one seen when two guys are fighting and the guy is beating the other guy in the stomach and out of T.V. comes this sound effect, which sounds like someone is halting an outdated wooden box. It started terribly and ended dangerously stupid, even my taste. I will say this though, the music in the back ground made the scenes see some what was acceptable. But not so much tolerable. My conclusion is this if you want to leave another movie that Kevin Summfield took seriously to buy "Sleepy Hollow High." <br /> <br /> I am still thinking of shooting myself to remove the pictures of the fake Mack 10.
