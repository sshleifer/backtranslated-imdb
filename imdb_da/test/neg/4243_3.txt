It was really amazed to see that someone would take so much time to evaluate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. Partisan "AF" was started in 1943, when two communist pilots from Croatian Ustashi AF, together with their observers in Breguet 19 and Potez 33 respectively, increased the plane saw some acts of punishment and hand bombing, but did not last long. A crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot was killed later while flying a Spitfire Vc. The real partisan squadrons were established when the RAF unloaded two of its (Yugoslav) squadrons of Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc, manned by ex-Yugoslav Royal Airforce pilots, and assigned them to Tito's forces on the island of Vis. Even they were never involved in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the movie was a huge cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, or not at all bad, director. At some fate of fate, I was present at the filming of the last series of the movie, as dozens of German aircraft were destroyed (Yugoslav 522 coaches also used in flying sequences) at Mostar Military Airport. The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scotch served lavishly by the movie staff being even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie and was often jokes by the modern audience.
