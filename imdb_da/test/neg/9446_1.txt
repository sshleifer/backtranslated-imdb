I never comment on a movie, but I have to say that this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel it was made by a novice movie student and not putting out talented movie students but it was terrible! I didn't buy the leading actress and felt like I was acting with her while she was on film. Her decisions were very secure and I feel she is imitating other actresses in movies and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was higher than the actors themselves. The end may have made a little more sense if someone was telling the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but she's quite often acting in movies. Maybe the song selection could be a little more original. The song "crazy" was such a clich√©. As I said before I never comment on movies and have seen my share of good and bad, but it was the worst. Pardon.
