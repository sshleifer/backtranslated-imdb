Cairo, or Pulse, as it is known by English speaking audiences, is set in Tokyo and starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit his friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to hear about a computer disk he has working on her place, he gives her the disk, but unfortunately she commits suicide in front of her. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently been connected to the Internet and continues to be scary messages and pictures on his screen, so he asks computer whiz Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) what happens, she knows Not really, but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full and they need another place to go, and the earth is just as good anywhere, right? These spirits do not like to share, so they kind of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, I don't really know because the movies are a bit messy ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa & right from the bat, I have to say I hated Cairo, I hated everything about it and it turns out that Asian cinema can produce something like shit like any American filmmaker. The scripture is a lengthy mess, it is simply not sensible with scenes that look as if they are from another movie, sequences that do not make sense or are not explained in any way. Cairo is also the most accurate boring movie I've put through this year. In two hours, this is a real task to sit through, I really wanted to speed it up, but I'm fair if nothing else so I put it to the bitter end and honestly wished I didn't. There are so many things wrong with Cairo, I assume the filmmakers went for a surreal ambiguous and deliberately incoherent feeling, but it is traits I despise in a movie unless they are done properly. Then there is the whole Internet, which I just couldn't relate to at all, I use the internet all day, and that's not at least scary to me in any way. Then there is the fact that Cairo as a movie delivered zero entertainment value to me, maybe I'm a Neanderthal, but I'm like the movies I see to entertain me, make some sense and don't live to death. <Br /> <br /> Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia as far as I'm concerned. If you have trouble sleeping, keep it in the DVD and you sleep fast within 10 minutes, I guarantee you. I didn't think Cairo was scary at least, the whole internet was ridiculous and as scary you should see some of the pop-up pop-ups I get, now it's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, sorry I just have to do the basic point again twice. Forget about action, tensions or doing, as there is no one. If you have a very nervous disposition, then maybe there are a few scenes that can creep you out otherwise it is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The movie looks so boring and boring it is false, the camera just sits there for very long shots and as it moves, it moves very slowly, it has all the style of a Mexican soap opera. When Cairo is subtitled it is difficult to judge the original notions, so I will not disturb, it is difficult to care for someone when they do not even speak the same language and you do not know what they say. <br /> <br /> Cairo is shit, I hated it and it's as simple and straightforward as that. Just because it is an Asian girl does not automatically make any good and mess in a story, plot the holes, it is not reasonable, and it is an absolute bore. Cairo would rightly be demolished if it was an American production. The worst movie I've seen this year with a certain distance. Cairo received a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).
