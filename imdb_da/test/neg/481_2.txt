It's so fake! The reason seems to be a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film. The common themes of blaxploitation such as racism, oppression and struggle for the integrity of your community are outlined so simply. And the jokes aren't even fun! Dolemite stands these up monologue comedy routines that are really painful. All the people around him deliver this can of laughter. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's the fakin 'funk. For much better comedy in a blaxploitation try "Coffy" & "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience try "Black Heat".
