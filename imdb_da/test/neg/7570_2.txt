This should be one of the most horrible script movies I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but finished with your standard snake-like puppet monster instead of a sleek Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the plot of the classic monster movie with the production quality and the play level The Creeping Terror, and you have an idea of ​​how this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is dubbed, although the original actors (I think the movie was originally dubbed in Italian for those countries and then redubbed for the US release), which just makes the movie seem strange .. The sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, just don't really match the action on the screen, even though the actors' lips move correctly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... he's definitely come a long way from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or any of the excellent movies he was in. Add this to his other sci fi-travesties (Panic in the Year Zero, and you can see once a good actor fall into a Boris Karloff syndrome ... stuck by making really bad horror movies in foreign countries just for work.
