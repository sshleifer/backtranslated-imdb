This is simply another bad Chuck Norris movie. Norris plays a policeman on the trail of a twig serial killer of women. He beat the guy away three years before, but the guy somehow comes through the bars in the nut housing he's in, using what resembles tooth tissue. Then, the killer escapes in a cleaning car and drives it over a 400 foot rock and survives to spend time around a theater under renovation. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best thing in this movie, but as in Superman II, he doesn't say a word. Somehow it should make him more threatening. Ron O'Neal of Super Fly fame and Steve James are wasted with the city's mayor and Norris sidekick, respectively. The film also contains the idiotic subplot of Norris and his girlfriend who has a child outside of marriage; It is then the 1980s. When connecting Norris' "serious" plays with over-the-top musical signals, every forthcoming scene signals predictably, the movie becomes a task to sit through. The construction, while searching for the killer in the theater, is interesting enough with Norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hiding place, but the end fight is disappointing after starting in such a promising way. It's another disappointment from Cannon Films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.
