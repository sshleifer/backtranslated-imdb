Yes, I really found this movie tasteless. <br /> <br /> I didn't like Sandra Oh character, she really annoyed me. She is unlikely to be accepted into rural Italian life because she is non-white. this was a bit of PC nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, one man she (Diane Lane) has an affair turned out to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: in the end, your typical plastic American brick pops up, all cheesy white smiles and brownish brown, and she finally finds what she wants all the time: a real American man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is quite racist in its portrayal of Italians and the way it undermines them as either smarmy lotharios or backmen. <br /> <br /> shooting was good, but the film and its attitude were trash can.
