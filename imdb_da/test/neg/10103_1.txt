Horrible deal with the worst special f / x I've ever witnessed. That's bad enough, I wasted $ 3 to see this crummy pile of crap, but it was one and a half time I lost that I could have done something else like getting a root canal or volunteering for the jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even help this video. To put it whole, I sincerely believe that I have actually lost a few IQ points during watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing "work"! Maybe I should have followed my own advice this time. Never expect a decent movie if it is written, directed and produced by the same person and never expects anything of value from Jeff Fahey.
