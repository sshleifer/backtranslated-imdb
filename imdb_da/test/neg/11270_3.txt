I've seen almost every movie from Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, this is a pretty average for bad movies. The ground contains two warring brethren - none of whom I have looked very much at - and it is very confusing to stop with who is ally with whom. The music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects are sometimes awful - rubber heads fly with roughly the same realism as the average high school game! On top of these complaints, the end of the movie completely destroys and undermines the whole picture. It turns out that the end is not true, but was completely "fudged". What is the meaning of this, then? If you've seen this movie, understand that there are many better movies out there, don't give up!
