Bela Lugosi is a real mystery. In the early 1930s he was at the top of the world after taking place in Dracula. Still, he repeatedly made miserable decisions about his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his drink and drug use had a role in it, or maybe he was just crazy. No matter what, he ruined his reputation by appearing in virtually any movie - from excellent horror movies (such as THE RAVEN) to big-budget flicks (like NINOTCHKA) to grade-Z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. Interestingly, even though he went in to make this horrible movie, he actually played the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! With regard to this film, it is a very stupid and horridly produced second world war propaganda film that highlighted a stupid plot and miserable editing. Lugosi spends much of the movie killing saboteurs - not a bad thing at all. But at the end we find out that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon, and all the Americans he killed were actually Japanese !!!! The funniest part of this is during a feedback. You can see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before changing them to American-like men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But on all the other non-close-ups, they are all very western-looking - many with bald head !! They saw absolutely nothing like Japanese men. I suppose the plot should have been rewritten, and it may well take into account the obvious mistake. Or it could just be foamed production values ​​and editing. In fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city, and all the cars (about 1942) are old Model T Fords - of course from stock footage !!! The bottom is that the film is bad, but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM Outer Space, it is hard to laugh at the imperfection - just be asleep at it.
