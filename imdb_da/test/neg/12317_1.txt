Bath. Bath. Bath. These three lines summarize this crazy little movie that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its ... # 1 movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese ladies fall asleep within 3 minutes. A paralyzed plot with dirty jokes. It is grotesque and terrible. When green eggs and skin come out in 2005, I will be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green eggs and ham. They will try to hunt Sam-I-Am and that means guy running away with it. (I hope they don't destroy the classic book.) Don't waste time and money by seeing this.
