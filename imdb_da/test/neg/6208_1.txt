Talk about shopping ... !!!! not only by Govinda but also by Salman and Lara .... The direction was horrible. For the first half hour you would almost like to change the film. Because this movie is a real stinker (feel my words. <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some o his comedy roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Jodi # 1, Akhiyon see Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai and it can't be compared to any of them, and Salman Khan shouldn't even come up with comedy roles !! He stinks, he doesn't know how to do comedy. The only good comedy role he did was in Andaz Apna Apna, who was brilliant next to Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> There were so many 'overly stupid unfunny' scenes in this movie that will take you out of the DVD and burn it, so no one others in your house will ever see it again.
