Greedy country baron in the small western city of Prairie City wants all ranchers to leave their country, using intimidation tactics and fire to leave them to think the city is swimming on oil and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave. he is knocked down by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafarers are coming soon and are slowly realizing what he is facing and trying to gather the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-west story, with everyone under the thumb's thumbs (obviously holding all the cards). Derivative and unpleasant at times to see, with a long wait, before our stoic finally gets his dander up. Sterling Hayden's half-hearted Swedish accent is a big problem, even though he cuts a solid and sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth seeing. Director Joseph H. Lewis phases most scenes stiffly, as a television western, and Gerald Fried's bugle-heavy score is no help, although the rich black and white filmography of Ray Rennahan is excellent. An independent production published via United Artists, the movie has a bizarre start (starting with shots from the finals followed by shots from the movie's mid section), but it has some needle force that the safer gets the viewer on Hayen's side. ** from ****
