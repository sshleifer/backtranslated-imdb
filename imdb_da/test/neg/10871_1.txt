Larry Bishop writes, writes and directs this soft core porno, plot less biker movies about nothing to do with anything. Calling this of the worst movies in 2008 is good for the waste I spent money on in theaters. Its one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was sorry for most girls who probably think they are making a feature film when they actually make a porn. They go on the set for four days, say some sexual lines to obnoxious old men - thirty years older than them - so take off their clothes and run naked for the four days they are on. I can only assume that it was Larry Bishop's only way to get laid. You see shot after shot directly on a girl's boxes. Shot after shot by bishop go up to some random chick and grab her most intimate parts as if he shook his hand. How this crap was even funded is over me. Why Tarantino has its name on it is beyond me, but he has slowly faded away since 1994, so I can't say I was surprised. After 15 minutes you get the horrible feeling that it is only awful (and I mean horrible) movie gives you. When you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is amplified. After 15 minutes I would cry to be so stupid and wasted, not just my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. There is no redeeming quality or moment in the film that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people had an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you don't see naked women all that often, then I think this movie would be for you. If you are eleven years old, you will probably like it. You can't even laugh at it, because every idiot who did it was laughing at the shed they made. The action is horrible, the writing is horrible, the production is horrible, and the steering is horrible. It is not even worth your time to rent it to see the car accident. Stay away, stay very far away. Don't even read these reviews. I shouldn't even write one.
