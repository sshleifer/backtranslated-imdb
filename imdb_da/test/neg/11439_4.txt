A rather mild horror movie; If not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily be a television movie. Plot holes in abundance (an example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the top floor of a house burned to the ground and a new building set 200 years later?), Carton making, signs do things that anyone with an IQ greater than their shoe size would not do ... <br /> <br /> It has had some fun moments, but in general it is a subparagraph movie that managed to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due. If you're looking for an extremely formal, predictable movie that can make a few laughs, it might be worth seeing. If not, then this is not for you.
