A vacation on a boat, a married couple, an angry servant and a shipwreck is the reason why these movies begin. <br /> <br /> I like breasts. No question about it. But when the protagonist allies with the one who happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. Take two men (one man and another man), put a clean cotton heel in the middle of them, on a desert island, pull out all his moral issues, several moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. <br /> <br /> The action is, I want to say, good. There are some bloopers, but not many, as far as I can see. The biggest female character makes me sick. This is due to her lack of moral values. The man with most fish gets their attention. Although one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with cheating with (Manuel) the other man because "I have to do it to survive". How can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is away? And he won't even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no difficulty in justifying everything she does. If she doesn't get approval for her actions, she's a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to watch this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make almost anything else you see this year, a pleasant movie experience.
