This movie is a third attempt at a compelling, moody thriller and fails in all three counts. It was just about keeping my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the rules of life he'd comfortably set in the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral. A vague plausible plotline (and it is generous) becomes completely reddish, as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzar events are never explained. <br /> <br /> This would not be so bad if the script was not 'It is so cheesy, the acting wood (despite a strong British cast) and the direction so uninspiring. This is not an example of good British filmmaking, nor should it make Tarantino bat an eyelid, at least not in relation to his previous work. <br /> <br /> In this case, my advice, if it's hard to get rid of, doesn't waste your effort. If you're a Brit like me and it's in your local video store, manage it well. Perhaps go to the video titled "American Beauty" - now it's a great British example.
