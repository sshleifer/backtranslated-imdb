Well!! the movie has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark TV movie. It comes from a Thomas Hardy novel. Catherine Zeta Jones has it in it. She is by far the only one in the movie that works better than in my high school theater class. Oh yes it has Clive Owen in it. I'm not British, so it means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel. Except he was in "Bourne Identity" and I liked it. It's just about breaking it all up. It was really everyone there. I get persistent, but I like CZJ, so I put it to the end. The computer tells me I don't have 10 lines and I continue to count them. I always count 11, but it may just not like my style, but that is my opinion of the movie as well.
