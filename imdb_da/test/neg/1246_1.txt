This is probably the worst movie I've seen for a long time. Independent or not, fixed writing is a must. Dito for management and action. I know these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporanos and more ...), but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically OK, Just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that backers for this movie also own the poker magazines because I saw a very good review in one of the magazines. "Hi" We made it so it must be good, right? "Not so fast Bucky. I know that it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made, much less sold and distributed, and so I recommend these people. But the final product leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> PS I won a free rental and chose this movie from Blockbuster, tomorrow I will get my money back.
