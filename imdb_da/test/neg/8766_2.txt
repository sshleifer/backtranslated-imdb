The back of the DVD for this movie raves, "Chey is Quentin Tarantino from Christian Films." This is not so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written, stylishly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes unfold in a confusing and unrealistic way and blended with some fine time-lapse photography. Flashbacks, falling to gray, freeze frames to tell the time (insignificant in history) are all finished without any other apparent reason than to give the film more cinematic credibility. The camera is random, some fine crane images are cut with ridiculous mounting that has no meaning. Poor blocking and lighting leaves the viewer wondering who is talking to whom in many scenes. Oh, and the sound is horrible. The special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But it's just technical. The movie fails to engage at an emotional level. The dialogue is so fake and the actors seem to have only read it for a moment before the camera rolled. The story ... the things that happen in order have no motivation behind them. The characters struggle to address a dimensionality. And the characters must take a stand on Christianity and belief in each scene. Take a queue from M. Night that engaging Christian movies does not have to have the characters that say the name of Jesus Christ in each scene for the film to be Christian. Goodness! Do not try to show this to your missed friends with expectations other than laughter.
