Looked at this movie with an audience of .... 5 in total! Had the choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (realized when I should have gone to Lakshya). A typical plot ... India against Pakistan .. but just isn't cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian superhero is on a mission to rescue India's president from some Pakistani rebels involved in a lot of drug trafficking. I left the movie halfway as it was just boring and the plot was confusing and everywhere. The songs were also horrible, the film trying to hide the flaws with its special effects, but unfortunately they are also outdated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... avoid it if you can, must be the worst movie I've seen this year.
