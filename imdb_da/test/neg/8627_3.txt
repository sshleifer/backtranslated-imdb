A real insult to the original "Spoorloos", which is one of the most genuinely disturbing movies (and I have it as a compliment!) I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original cools and brilliantly, remake is flat and even boring, especially the "happy end" finale takes away what little excitement was in this movie at first. <br /> <br /> While such distortion (especially grafting a "happy end" that was not there earlier) is quite often the case in "Hollywood" generation of European art house films and could have been expected. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this creepy mess was created by the same filmmaker who made the original "Spoorloos" ... Why Mr. Sluizer decided to destroy his masterpiece in such a way is beyond me. Avoid this abomination at all costs, as it could ruin the original for yourself if you * saw * it, let alone vice versa ...
