** WARNING ** MISERABLE MOVIE ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas Eve, some nuts decided he would entertain us by sending this movie as "entertainment" on TV. What in God's name did he think? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with horrible humor, despicable plays, miserable jokes, and a plot of plot. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role of cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain-dead person who is not capable of even the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was stupid as a brick, but the company he worked for was sorry so they sent him and his family on vacation. But being as stupid as he was, he managed to make the holiday a disaster. <br /> All in all, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I still have nightmares over the miserable plays and even more miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad you almost have to see it ... But don't. The nightmares I have are far worse than any other nightmare you will ever have. Trust me ... I hate this movie so badly because of the acting, humor, "jokes" and story. The only good thing was the beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my opinion, and I hope everyone agrees with me ...
