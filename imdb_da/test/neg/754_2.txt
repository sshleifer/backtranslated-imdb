Sometimes changes in novels when made for movies are not only necessary but a good thing. But for Northanger Abbey it's a very, very bad thing. Not only is the story itself torn to strips, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and it is a mixture of romance and intrigue that does not even affect the bitter comment that Austen put into her work. It is not entertaining or satirical at all, and instead transforms the character's fascination with his fantasy world into mostly a drama. <br /> <br /> This also affects the romance. It is meandering and futile. Chemistry and interest have never been established. The reasons Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the movie and leave the audience wondering what he sees in her. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someday soon we will get a more faithful version if Austen's satire.
