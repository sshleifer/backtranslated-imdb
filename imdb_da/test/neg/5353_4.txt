There are other reviews here that express similar views, but I still feel pressured to add my comments. The film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, except perhaps being too long. The action is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey doesn't have much room to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be eye-catching, which she does very well. /> <br /> At a basic level, the film's heart is in the right place to be against racism, and I get the impression that it was trying to be a kind of final treatment for racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. However, it seems that the authors have little more than they could chew (I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much is down to Grisham). The biggest problem that many others have said is that it ends up defending vigilant justice. Apart from the fact that I do not agree with that attitude, I do not believe that such a view actually does help the anti-racist cause at all - it is more likely to be used to relieve white defendants who kill black victims. In the end, the prosecutor calls on the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow it through and imagine the defendant being a white man who murdered black rapes ... ultimately, the message seems to be that It's ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. It is also practical that the man who was killed was presented as total evil, and his guilt was undoubtedly, which removes any moral ambiguity that is likely to be in reality. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson is a great achievement, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as a person of great integrity, but it's hard to believe he would be willing to save Behind an outlaw (and he doesn't do that when the push comes to push). We must be supposed to believe that this is because he is facing the death penalty, but in reality at some point he is offered a demand for violence, but if you blink, you may miss it. Why not take it when he needs to know that his chances of acquittal are slim? Or if he wants to make a stand in court, why rely on insanity? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious errors. The medical experts whose testimony the case rests on are jokes - both are discredited for extremely incredible reasons, and none of them provide any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say what they are asked to say and should not be believed. That the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately likely, but still a little practical (and what if he was dead?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK would march down the street in the big daylight. Other seemingly serious crimes (uprising, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) pass by without visible attempts to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes back is ridiculous. My last reaction has to be followed fairly dirty - as if I have to be racist because I disagree with the decision. It might be that the film intended to explore different views and let the audience decide, but if they then seem to have forgotten it when they came to the end. The film made me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion so that it succeeded at some level - but I am worried that it might have resumed strongly illiberal views on some people who I hope the opposite is what it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> Finally thought - try to look at law and order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes on screen time!
