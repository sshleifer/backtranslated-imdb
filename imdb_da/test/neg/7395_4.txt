Imagine a GILLIGAN ISLAND in the African desert of modern times. Add people not as close as uneven as Skipper or Marianne - and enough fear to fill a German psychiatrist's office. Throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodic and literary parallelism that never dives deep enough to really satisfy. Season with a really morose topic that has been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If KINGEN LEVER was not a product of the ruling czars du jour of Dogme 95, would this film garnish so much attention? Dogma 95 is to Hollywood as a Danish modern is to rococo. A by-product of digital technology seeks this Scandinavian movement - rather dogmatic - to remove the artificiality of film making by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of the story. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the dogma antichrist. <br /> <br /> Director / co-author Kristian Levrings saga thinks of interpersonal relationships and human nature when placed under the fire in a life-threatening situation. Pupils aboard a bus running through the naerist dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned city. An African room that doesn't speak their language serves as an observer and tells (whose insight is among the most trenchant of the movie). As the strongest heads go out to a five-day walk to the nearest village, the others remain behind, surviving on down-canned carrots and encircling their anticipated future as a gripping forest. Former Thespian Henry decides that this rather unpleasant crew member requires a diversion and handwrites KING LEAR from memory. He assigns roles, and the group goes many days learning lines and practicing an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable. <br /> <br /> Gradually, throwing is losing it and nature's game? ? Or, William Golding may say that human nature begins to surface. If you've ever seen the Lord of the Flies, you know that these things can get ugly that being in a lifeboat situation can even turn Mother Teresa into the PMSing Thermant in Calcutta. <br /> <br /> The film was shot using an international ensemble of American, English, French, and South African actors, who dogma dogma dictates, develops themselves and their roles quite organically. KING was also filmed chronologically and added a realism to the ever-growing desperation of his characters. After up to three handheld cameras shot in digital, the results were transferred to 35 mm film. The performance that compels the most comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a boho Pop Tart trying to strengthen the spirit group in every way she can. Henry (David Bradley) is another fine game character whose passion for the work of his life ultimately saves the band from complete despair. It is hard to feel sorry for the other cruel wives and their oafish husbands, hirsute old womanizers, sulky French intellectuals, wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the Namibian desert. Beckett could hate this question, but why does this group drive a bus together through remote Africa in the first place? Life-threatening morbidity! Whole despair done in graphic detail! A relentlessly boring pace! Enjoy.
