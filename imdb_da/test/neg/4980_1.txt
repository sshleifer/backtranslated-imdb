I looked through the movies as needed and saw Underdog free and it was only 82 minutes long so I decided to watch it. I didn't expect much, but it exceeded my expectations of being horrible. Everything about the movie was cringe worthy. The dialogue was horrible with many terrible sayings. The witnesses were also terrible. I found myself shouting and flipping from my TV screen as I walked through this trash. It hit its audience very well, but I can't see how others could enjoy this movie. It made me very angry and almost cried because of everything terrible that this movie was coming. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1/10 after seeing it. I ask you to avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for children, but there is nothing good at it.
