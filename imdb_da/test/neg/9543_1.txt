A formal story with all the tired clich√©s. I was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! What a waste! How many ORIGINAL scripts are scattered around without being produced? <br /> <br /> On the climax I could predict what would happen in each shot. <br /> <br /> Oh, and don't even get me started on the idiotic sexual tension between the beautiful female policeman and the paralyzed policeman who can barely move a finger. YEAH RIGHT. I can buy it. What's next? Fingers porn?
