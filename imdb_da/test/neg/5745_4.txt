Slayer is a thoughtless vampire movie with a few twists on an old plot. Special ops team is sent to South America to hunt blood sucking natives. Their leader is a genuine old man who has had a good time. There is an environmental distortion as the vampires attack villages because their rainforest and ancient wild animal diet disappear because of the greedy companies and farmers. Lost of fighting and so much blood that they just never plagued washing the noise for the whole movie. It looks like they were sleeping in the bloody clothes and cutting on blood. While each member of the player brought their own talents, it didn't really flap like a movie. The effects were OK, except that the vampires dangled from the buildings on the wires. If you're looking for lots of blood and violence, this is for you.
