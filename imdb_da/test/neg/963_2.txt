DANGER: Look for falling spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Boy, was this a bad movie. I know they went to a "true love conquering all" kind of thing, but if this whole movie was conquered it was about 3 (which felt more like 9) hours in the afternoon, which I never come back to. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta, who live in a remote city in a fantasy world. Kai is the very abused bellboy in a hotel owned by Geras father. First, Gerta Kai's progress ignores, but she eventually warms him much to the abhorrence of (You Guessed It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle was not enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a glass of cut into the Kai's eye, and he becomes a mediocre person who treats Gerta badly. Kai is finally taken to the snow queen's fortress (which is the same as the hotel just covered by the ice, because the good people at Hallmark want to go out) and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back. Along the way she enters the 3 other seasons that are evil in her own special way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some boring and forgetful characters she encounters along the way. (All the while you want to turn it off, but can't force yourself to do it. It's probably the most evil and most effective spells from the snow queen) At least I will save you from the end because all you can think of Your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. So in conclusion, Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie that takes the fan out of imagination.
