I'm a big comedy show fan. Racial humor is always a little risky, but greats like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli, etc. Pull it all out. <br /> <br /> They don't go overboard, make the audience uncomfortable or * cough cough * STEAL JOKES! But I don't want it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racing music quite uncomfortable. His jokes are constantly screaming racing music to the point where it is not fun or wise, but it is insulting. I'm not one to get cold with race humor. But his performance of these jokes is sloppy, which causes people to recoil on his comedy. His humor is only surpassed by his stage presence in irritation. I feel like he's SCREAMING on me all the time! And he runs around the scene like a madman. It just comes out as annoying!
