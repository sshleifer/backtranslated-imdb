I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it quite comical. Isobel is obsessed with the devil. Somehow, a perverted priest and gardener will fix it. Share exorcism and some soap opera you get at least some laughs. There is the paranoid jealous father, the satanic sister, the Doll of the Dolls and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt who chases pastor fights the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this. Instead of the chilly twist, curse and crucifixion sails humping, as Regan did in The Exorcist; You get a lot of Isobel jumping on her bed as if it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese that has gone wild. So if you want to see a quote, unquote horror movie worth a laugh while waiting for the predictable end ... this is your movie.
