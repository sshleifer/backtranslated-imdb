I rented the video from "The Piano Teacher" who knew nothing about anything other than what was written on the video box. I did it with some inflammation because movies that win awards in Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter category. Ca. a quarter of the way into it I found myself loud and saying, "This movie is boring." About halfway I was saying to myself, "Where have I seen this before?" In the three quarters I had found out. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary origins, this movie is essentially a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier (1969) and better, "The Cold Day in the Park." Although the details clearly differ, and Altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing "new" to see in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before: a sign emerging out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant" 1992); a perverted and condemned 'love' culminating in an operative (near) death scene (David Cronenberg's "M. Butterfly" 1993); unusually brutal sex scenes (David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" 1986); etc. Therefore, I am confused by the fact that so many found the movie to be "shocking," "crushing," etc. This highly-derived film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded some. However, I strongly attribute such a reaction to the lack of movie experience. Watch enough movies and you will really have seen it all. And although it's true that I saw the discontinued R-rated version, I doubt that the extra scenes would change my overall opinion on "The Piano Teacher." Technically, the film is not without profit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert's credible performance also helps save it from wasting time. This is the first of Haneke's films I've seen, and if I were to see more, I expect I would have the same opinion of him as I have of Ferrara: an interesting instructor, but not nearly brilliant, others make him to be . Rating: 4/10.
