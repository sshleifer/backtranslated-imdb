It is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. This one came out one day before the other with Tom Cruise. Didn't they do that with Truman Capote that year, and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Author / director David Michael Latt did not have Steven Spielberg's budget and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster, which amounted to DKK 588 million. USD all over the world. The action was minimal, and most of the time we were treated with Rhett Giles, who played a priest who gave up on his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was scary as an army LT.
