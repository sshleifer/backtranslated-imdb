Seen this in a Sneak Preview yesterday and have to say it was terrible. After the credits I thought, "Hey, with this roll it will be pretty good". Not at all that way. <br /> <br /> Lame predictable moans, terribly simply drawn characters (perhaps except a little Ms Lara) and an end one could predict 10 minutes in the movie. And worst of all, it abused a delicate theme (handicapped) at low level and most tasteless jokes without touching anything other than the surface of the problem. The disabled person with whom the film sympathizes with the most is the one who just fails it. What kind of message is that? And the film has no thought at all, and it basically comes to "I love you, doesn't matter, you acted like a dot." <br /> <br /> In summary: Great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a horrible flick.
