If you're planning to see 'Partner' and are on IMDb reading reviews about it, you've already wasted too much time on this stupid, idiotic, horrible movie. It's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of the movie 'Hitch.' I choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews I had heard about this movie, and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it - I thought after all that David Dhawan is doing it and it has Govinda - how bad could it be ? But after 20 minutes of seeing this fog, I couldn't take it anymore and turn off my computer. Overacting everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total time spent - I gave it a 1 star rating because it's the lowest you can do. If I could go lower, I would have given it a -100 rating.
