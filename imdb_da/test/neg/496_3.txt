Here is another great movie critic will love. The problem is that it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is simple. Nine judges escape a prison after the tithe that becomes crazy and tells them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> The first half has very slapstick some of it very wide, while the other half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes work very well (The boys are colliding a friend's house that has a new Philippine bride, is fun. While a later scene with the big guy works in the restaurant's tugboats on the heartbeats.) They simply do not go into each other. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie lacks entire set-ups. A scene shows the boys desperately looking for change during a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the entire crew in a row sitting down in a restaurant. Where do they wear dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most confusing is why are they in a row? They are clearly the guys in a row and do it seem to be something more memorable to witness than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to interfere. (In fact, they carry matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the film) The film has very little character development in the first half, and as a result, the second half lacks an emotional blow. As we often try to find out who is who in their individual payoff scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of a move, the second half has all the wonderful sweeping camera pictures and great emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great movie. It is also scary slowly, giving a dull movie. 9 Souls are a big disappointment, the reviews go over a great movie and in there is a place of good luck finding it for yourself.
