The movie starts with its most intelligent joke and goes downhill from there (pun intended). Then there are lots of potty humor and sexual situations. The beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Swear-word puns are not meant to be key idea jokes, but they try it here. The battle between the two groups in the local town (richies and poories) is an old tried and true setup, so how could it go wrong? Well, there's no reason to envy the "richies" or any reason to be upset by the poor so we can forget about the central plot. Situational humor is all toilet or sexually targeted to teenagers, but only yarns giggles, no true stomach laughter. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the comedy for this movie is the character humor with the blind man giving some rehashed, but rarely used setups, and the black bar owner gives the formal "street" or "hood" humor. <br /> <br /> Forget about the jokes that have to kill some snowboard shots since this was a commercial business. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of background actions that could be inspiring. The rest were all "B" class tricks or worse. The big moment when the main character rides "the goat", a man-killing ski slopes, gave a shot where a small avalanche eats the stuntman. This was the best of boarding in this movie. Any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects of the movie, the soundtrack was average, surprising as the snowboarding documentaries are regularly filled with quality melodies. You can capture many editing errors, and even though it was shot on a ski slope, most "scenery" pictures could not convey any sense of true size. <br /> <br /> All in all, it might be worth looking into if you've managed to turn your brain away completely and you like silicon breasts. Even then you will not remember anything from here two days later. <br /> <br /> Snowboarding is still waiting for it's final comedy, you'd rather watch a snowboarding documentary.
