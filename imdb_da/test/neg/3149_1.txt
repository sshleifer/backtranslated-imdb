Barney is the idiot dinosaur who (unfortunaltely) did not extinct with the other dinosaurs many years ago. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that is 100% worthless and / or extremely dangerous: it's "STRONGER IS YOUR FRIENDS THAT DON'T MEET!". The reason I say he's evil? Well, on YouTube, there is a video of a Barney song on toy balls. When it is played backwards, it looks like "we are all going to hang you! Let's stop!" Don't believe me? See it for yourself! I also read on another review that they are now reading PC folklore and adventure. Now it's just stupid with a capital S! I really mean! Anyways I do not recommend letting your kids see this rubbish as it contains stupid morals as strangers are your friends (as said before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sorry to eat junk food, It an individual taboo, magic can solve all your troubles and heaps of other ridiculous crap.
