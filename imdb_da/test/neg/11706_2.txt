I can't say enough how bad this movie was. First and foremost, what a waste of some legendary stars, even though they are quite old and quite unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well enough, he must have blamed someone a great favor, as this was his last movie role. The scripture is a mess, and the film seems horrible. I might imagine that if I saw this back when it came out (1981), I thought it was decent. But it was one of the worst to see so many real good horror movies. The only real convincing thing in this mess was the very young and lovely kind / scary Alice Krige. The main young personality tried to act the best he could, but was horrible. I was not sure how much it was of his lack of skill or the lack of an understandable script, but in some way he was simply poor. Beware unless you want to see a bunch of old guys being somewhat scared.
