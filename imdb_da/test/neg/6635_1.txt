Yes, the voices are in. This film may well be Plan 9 from outer space to our generation. But while Ed Woods movie, for all its shortcomings, retains some charm after all, this movie defines the word "charmless" for the nth degree. In fact, I would suggest the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary to quote this movie as a key example that defines that word in the next update to the dictionary. <br/> <br /> Carrot Top is a practitioner of such abysmal abilities that usually rational people, whom I know when hearing his name, become homicidal lunatics who are willing to kill Mr. Top as soon as possible. In fact, if you go to Amazon.com and look at customer reviews for Carrot Top's movies and other performance DVDs, you will find more that can be perceived as death threats to Mr. Top. <br /> <br /> Another curious fact about this movie, I remember that Mike Nelson, lead writer of the MST 3000, in his book Mike's Mega Cheese about movies, good and bad, said he saw this movie and shortly afterwards couldn't remember anything about it, including the title. Of course, Mike suffers a classic reaction to trauma. Seeing this cruelty was so soulless, Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (It was obviously in a later chapter of his book that Mike Nelson had restored his memeory of this movie. From the review he offers, Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the restored memory.) The only comment I offer about the movie and It's not a spoiler, it's simply God's honest truth, it's not fun. None of it is, not even a nanosecond of it is fun.
