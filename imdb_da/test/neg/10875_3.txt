Tarentino was ashamed to be involved in this horrible movie. The action, director and script are all triple - with the whole movie playing as an excuse for author / director / star Larry Bishop to be posted. The only reason for that was at all due to its affiliation with the QT. The movie's plot is pretty flimsy, and in principle tries to survive on unclear references to older B movies and some comos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each one is effortless in their performance, especially Hopper who is in full pay on closure at this point in his career. The saving grace, if any, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino skirt and just fails miserably, which can be quite humorous at times and rattles on others. I just wanted to check this one out if you love bad movies ... or if you're really into biker movies.
