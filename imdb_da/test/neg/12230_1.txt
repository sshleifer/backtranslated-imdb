Should all the joke films require pure stupidity and lack of any intelligence whatsoever for humor? Is there even just one real FUNNY parody movie anymore? All I see is zero quality film that looks like a few stony high school students, bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they are not wise, they are not entertaining, they are just useless in every way possible. Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its fate level of waste by not calling itself "Sports Movie". However, it is the same. There are a few different authors for these films, Wayans did some, Freidberg and Seltzer did some others, and I'm sure there is another couple. I can't even tell the difference in direction or humor to be honest, it seems like the same people wrote and directed them. I can't tell if the comebacks were made by the people who did the Scary Movie or the guys who made the Epic Movie, or anyone else, it's just the same jokes from all the others. <br /> <br /> If you have any taste or taste of humor, you can't watch this movie. If you have self-esteem, don't bother to see it. If you have any respect for filmmaking, don't even consider seeing it. Don't see it in any broken, abandoned theater that can still carry it, don't rent it, don't order it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, not the Redbox it and not even see it for free at the OD. Avoid it as bothered. <br /> <br /> The only conceivable reasons I can see to watch this movie are as follows. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you like to torture yourself, there are very few better ways. B. See a good example of why avoiding something that says "Fox Atomic". C. You will be paid a considerable amount of cash. <br /> <br /> I really didn't want to see the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100 to do it. It's just thoughtless, psychologically collapsing plague. <br /> <br /> You might as well see Zohan.
