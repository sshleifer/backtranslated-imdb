My Take: Another lame PG-13 horror movie with predictable scary tactics and a derived plot. <br /> <br /> The spirits move. The walls are shattering. There's something wrong in the basement. These, along with several other horror movie clich√©s, burst the walls of another house in the country in Sam Raimi-produced THE MESSENGERS, a lame pastiche of the most predictable scary tactics thrown into a plot that was reused from better (and sometimes, yet worse) screams from the past. As the Salomon family moves into an old South Dakota farmhouse, in another attempt by Dad (Dylan McDermott) to reconnect to the family, especially with their formerly drunk driver daughter Jessica (the underrated Kristen Stewart), in the more subtle landscape than their home in Chicago. The fear follows when Jessica starts to get a little surprise visit from the house's poltergeists. Thinking she is a teenage girl crying wolf, her parents don't believe her. How could they? The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for which horror movie it will be watching next. Will it be an angry bunch of crows who want more than family crops (a direct rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece THE BIRDS)? Will it be a haunted house with a story from AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will it be the grotesque phantoms taken from your well-known recent horrors like THE RING and THE GRUDGE? Heck, the movie even manages to tear off a scene or two from some really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Perhaps all Pang Brothers would really like to make a B-level horror movie, but had it been so bad? Couldn't they rip-off from the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of 5.
