My Take: Even amazing underwater photography can save a well-known script and paper-thin characters. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't already had enough of the free WILLY photos, FLIPPER can earn a decent rental. Others are (strongly) suggested to stay away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless affair, it hardly shows anything to the adult audience (unless it's your first time seeing a dolphin). A remake of a television series and films from the 1960s, FLIPPER can sound like a good idea since then: A dolphin praises the life of a boy and a girl they help with the environment by first getting rid of toxic waste that Thrown into the Florida Keys sparkling waters while beating a shark and a salt sea baddie which happens to be responsible for the poisonous dumping and also happens to hate dolphins. But even in the 90s, especially if an honestly similar movie like FREE WILLY was a new hit, FLIPPER is just another harmless, but occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids. Although the animals (this is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, typecast as the villain) and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, there's nothing much in FLIPPER to steal from anyway. <br /> <br /> The story is completely predictable, something than today even a 6-year-old can find clearly. The (human) casting, led by a prime minister of the Elijah Wood ring and an out-of-work Paul Hogan, rarely has anything to do but stand around looking beautiful. Their action skills, whatever they may be in this movie, are rarely revealed on the screen unless you consider the "acting" talents of cheerful Bottlenose Dolphin. I do not think you are trying to recommend FLIPPER as mindless family entertainment, will not be fair, but everyone over 10 years of age (No, do it 8), is better to rent or buy something else. In addition, the film is about 95 minutes tops. It can just give you enough time for something else without worrying about your kids. It alone can be worth renting. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
