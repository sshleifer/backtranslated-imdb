Yes why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80s and 90s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, infuriating sometimes, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. However, Van Sant's "Psycho" gives me a break. Why? I wonder. A shot by shot massacre by one of the perennial classics. The color was devastating, the performances, terrible. What did Vince Vaughn do? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a great actor, but in this case he couldn't let us forget John Gavin, and if Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this show, there would have been no "Hours" for her, "The Minutes" maybe. So here I am bad to think of one of my idols' works. The crash problem remains: Why, Mr Van Sant? Maybe, in the form of President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid it's not an excuse.
