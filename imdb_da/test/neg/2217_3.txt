Why is it impossible to write in French? Very Kitchen! This journey in the middle of the earth is despicable technical possibilities still present in 1976. These great "Casimir" of monsters are absolutely ridiculous! However, the film deserves a "remake" as it was "KING KONG" (the last one), with a slightly more presented scenario. The professor is similar to Professor Calculus and is pretty funny. David (the sign) is probably inconsistent, but crosses (spends) to the people below a good message "You unite and will overcome you!" All in all, we would say a movie made in the 40s. Now that I said everything (or almost) the evil that I was thinking of, we can say that if we have the brain, get tired or something to see of the other, then the matter (even if it is) is even entertaining. Hugh! Such is my opinion! (French to English translation with "Reverso": sorry for possible errors!)
