After enjoying Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and to see what direction it had taken. Rarely has a movie so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. While attempting to represent "civilized warfare" in the form of sports, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scale and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have a goal in mind, and this movie had poor structure and unclear goals. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that do nothing to develop their theme. On the plus side, it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is also so ecological that I have to remind myself several times that I didn't see an advertisement to promote the American lifestyle. Perhaps this perplexity reflects the ongoing "war on terror". When they represent "sport as war", the prominent team logos ensured that the United States was depicted as a winner. Therefore, it missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports around the world and show that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilized warfare. In addition to the press, the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget within the framework of New York and there was little recognition of "life as a war" in the rest of the world. Gallery of faces (wax works) gave only a nod to the existence of important people outside the United States. The actors missed the point that globalization does not mean Americanization. Philip Glass soundtrack sounded much like any other Philip Glass score I've heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and at best can be described as "inoffensive" neither adds nor detracts from the chaotic imagery.
