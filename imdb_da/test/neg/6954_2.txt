Michael Caine could have tried to make a bigger than life character to a successful degree, but the whole story and character is around him where not sympathetic or interesting at all. It was all very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, one of my favorite actors, didn't matter. He was useless. Michael Caine became a little annoying after a while, and the movie couldn't decide whether it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tried hard and good at him, but I felt the direction and the story let him down. Do not waste your time. It starts well in the first 10 minutes and then it is about it. A movie for Die Hard Caine Fans Only. Stay away from this one ...
