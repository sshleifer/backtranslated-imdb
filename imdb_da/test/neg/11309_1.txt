After watching this movie, I felt sick in my stomach, and if I had seen a moment, I would have rushed to the bathroom and vomit to dawn. A sick movie that wasn't fun and not worth the money, any money at all. If anyone ever wants to watch this movie, don't! Your children will never forgive you and claim illness for a week. So if you appreciate your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, please don't watch this movie. I ask for you, not!
