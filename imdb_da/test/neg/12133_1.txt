Heh ... I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone being available for rent! <br /> <br /> This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that only exist for T&A and the cheap laughs. The storyline crosses a bit of "Texas Chainsaw massacre" with a twisted mom-centered back story reminiscent of "Psycho", and some of the good old women-in-chains, throw-as-nails-ex-con broads threw in a good sense - in other words, completely unoriginal wrapped in half-naked women spiced with a touch of complete idiocy! When you look at the director's attempt to make the Quebec moss pass as the southern American bayou country is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Funny to me is, I was actually the premiere of this flick when I was friends with Ratchford, the movie's "star" at that time. It was painful to look at when Jeremy sank in his seat while the girl unfolded her missing wings. I'm glad to see that after this shame, Ratchford's first flick has grown into a hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly on the Canadian police drama "Blue Murder", appeared on "CSI", not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood movie "Unforgiven" - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a rocky start, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T.Paul
