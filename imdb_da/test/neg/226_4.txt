"Fool for Love" is one of the many now forgotten films, Robert Altman, directed through the 1980s. This, a screen customization of a Sam Shepard game that features Shepard in the lead, is simply not very good. Altman made many non-very good films during his fascinating career, and many times was his mistake. But here I think the bug lies with Shepard to write such a flimsy game. Altman's direction is assured, the performance is etc. Given what the actors need to work with, but this inconsistent script goes nowhere and takes its time there. Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly during an evening spent in a dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton), who may be either a figurative or literal father of both Eddie and May, clearly complies . Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast that a gentleman calls. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic nook throughout the plot is the suggestion that Eddie and Mays relationship is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The manuscript does not examine their relationship in any detail, and it does not use their relationship to explore more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, lightweight characters that get annoying within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have a little to do but give reaction shots. <br /> <br /> The last half hour or so of the movie is particularly bad when Eddie and Mike's back stories start playing out in the flashback of monotonous, somnolent voice over. <br /> <br /> Lime this Up to another of Altman's experiments had gone wrong. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
