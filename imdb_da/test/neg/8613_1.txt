Now I see lots of movies and this really sucked ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of the low budget package to make Vampire Movies using a kind of "Martial Arts Teacher" turn "actor" type movie. I'm also so tired of the guy who knows some kind of fighting technique and then can fight his way through a little boring movie. I forced myself to see it and one of the main reasons was that the manager's actress is pretty pretty (Ha-Ha) Well, I hope it helped a little and if you have the time and want to give your brain a rest Now hopefully one Today, this type of movie will not be released, but then hi, where will all the Low Budget players go :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also contains many Bloops, but I will leave you there to find it because it adds quite fun while watching and also if you are a bit of a perfectionist it will bother you ;-) Cheers !!
