When the American film industry tries to critically look at their own government, they certainly make it look good, even if it's bad. The movie does 1 thing right, it perfectly demonstrates what is wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be f ** k with the one who takes to get things done !!! Among an American congressman, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to k Ruskies. Thanks to the US for giving us Osama Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The disappointment of the movie comes in the face of confusing the problems: Use pictures of Afghan children without arms and stories of Soviet atrocities and then make a blatant attempt to suggest a connection between them and the reasoning behind it. US help. Every sensible person knows why the $ 1,000,000,000 was raised ... not the dying Afghan children who are for sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, the serious problems are covered by the facade of bullshit dialogue. "Here's for you, you M *** r F ***** s" Hoffmam chants at the end, all that is missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military dissolved substances. The movies can't help but leave the tasting of the feeling of American pride and joy about how we (the Americans) have saved the world ... again. Not even the last 5 minutes of the movie can save it where you try to stop praising and waking up that it's just another American F ** k up. <br /> <br /> However, the actor and editing was good.
