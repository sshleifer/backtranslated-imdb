First, it has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu with starring Gordon Liu. I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and reviews (no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the story of the 18 weapons states that a monk told some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons do not really look again and the fighting is all boxing style. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard of before or any of the other actors. The film mentions another director Wu Yuen Ling as well as the one IMDb list. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who seem to have sunk without trace of this movie. The battles are reasonable and frequent but not big, and the 'star' doesn't have much charisma. Twist at the end is just stupid, and the movie seems to end abruptly as if they were sad. The landscape and training sequences in the river are slightly different than normal. Unfortunately, the beautiful sister does not drown the very annoying (but acrobatic) young boy.
