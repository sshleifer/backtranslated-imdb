In the 1990s, several attempts have been made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in the form of a ridiculously bad "Yamato 2520" which was completely abandoned after just two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and pointless "Harlock Saga" while the Galaxy Express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stuck to its name. <br /> <br /> If you've seen "Queen Millennia", remember that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a sequel to this already completed chapter and also find a way to suck. How to do it. <br /> <br /> This movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie, blends it with poorly paced melodrama and adding an insult to injury, throwing in some of the most famous characters from Matsumoto's universe . <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good illustration, but the rest is so incredibly bad that it can't save this movie from being a total loss. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed the Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie. You want to thank me.
