I don't mind the odd artistic film. But when they are arguing with arcane symbolism and scary dialogue, and when it is obvious, they were made for the filmmakers' ego rather than the viewer's advantage, I am sad. I'm not a stupid person, but I simply didn't understand what this movie was trying to say. Or do. Movies are a great form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it instead of confusion?
