This is a film with an excellent concept for a story, but it was sidetracked, but a large number of clich√©s, clad and unrealistic portrayed characterizations and performances, and some honestly unacceptable (and very random and not least practical as plot points to move the story to its incredible finish). The lack of something that marked the lead as actually gay, apart from some random references to the Crow Bar or that he is gay, was disturbing. It wouldn't have hurt to actually show him doing anything, even if it was just meeting a friend for drinks. It is worth checking out and having it profit. There is not much, even a few years after the film was released, in the way of films that both have a gay lead or a substantial homosexual line, and it is also about African Americans. Because it's worth checking out. I didn't want to look too hard for it, and I wouldn't waste my time looking for it to own. This is a rental and not a premium rental on it.
