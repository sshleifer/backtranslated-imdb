Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and lame, and unless it is indirectly intended, this film actually reinforces the Nazis and portrays them as honorable men and shows that the Jewish people deceive, cannot keep promises and bloody evil ((The following includes SPOILER)) Hitler along with the most infamous Nazis participating in a stupid plot lesser film about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is incredibly ridiculous. The Nazis laugh and mock every killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, is the deal in the end lame. What is really awful is that the film has received good reviews and is placed here in the 40s among the biggest 250 films. Will not be surprised if it reaps many awards, including Oscars. The movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but hi reconsider, it doesn't even do a good job doing it. The dwarf really made the whole Nazi Jewish conflict and a pure insult to anyone who fought and suffered the Nazi tyranny.
