I would like to say that I liked this movie, I really do, but when it boils down to it, it was just too boring. It starts to look promising, and even when they enter the mines, the eerie atmosphere and atmosphere are fantastic. The problem is the monster or the lack of it. As people have said, it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look good if done properly). The problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't see any deaths. This is supposed to be a horror movie, so lack of monster and lack of death are indifferent. There were some scenes I liked, like when a girl uses her camera in the dark and the monster comes against her. There are also a few other scary scenes, but they are far too few to keep your interest and definitely not worth watching the movie. It's a shame because I can see that if it had been handled properly, it would have been an effective scary horror flick. The saddest thing is that movies like this are never made again because movie producers over-polish their movies these days and rely on crappy CGI effects.
