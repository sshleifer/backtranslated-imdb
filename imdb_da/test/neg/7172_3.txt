This movie starts with children who tell each other urban legends as a poodle in the microwave and get something extra at a chicken spot. Unfortunately, it turns to your basic anthology movie. The first is about a caretaker with a little secret. This is fine at best. Then it gets worse as the next story about this child, who is obsessed with dead flies, is on, and it goes on and on. It's too long and not all that interesting to start with. Then you get the typical choke scene and it ends. You need more than this in an anthology movie. You need at least three stories, and you should not be so long, it will be terribly uninteresting, especially as you can see how it will end a mile away.
