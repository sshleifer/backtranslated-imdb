This French movie apparently is about a creepy, obscure policeman investigating rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film is not about anything, and it takes forever to say nothing. If it takes a sign ten minutes to move from point A to point B, the movie uses ten minutes to show this trip and these are the "action" scenes. There are also static shots that last for minutes so the viewer wonders if he accidentally turns the pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The film lasts seven hours or so. You do the math. The actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. Note to yourself: Never see a Dumont movie again.
