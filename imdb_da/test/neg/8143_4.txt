This movie is perfect for over the top cheesy zombie lovers. It's a movie you can laugh from acting to the horrible zombie action. That being said, I gave this a 4 out 10 for effort cos horror is a tough genre to make. going down the list the bad points in this movie were as follows. <br /> <br /> #Bath make up # horrible sound and sound effects #really bad continuity #cheesy dialogue # a song is played through the whole movie #stein couldn It doesn't work and in my opinion, it's one of the worst I have seen # throbbing end #racist moment and steal Simpson's character, the good points #good costume #police officers seemed to have the best functioning exp # actors with smaller lines or small roles seemed to be better # good try with gore < br /> <br /> I don't want the bad movie, it's fun to see cos of these bad points and I think what makes this movie OK. If it was better, I don't think it would have made any difference, but it wouldn't be interesting to see a remake with the same cast as I think they might have improved over the last 7 years.
