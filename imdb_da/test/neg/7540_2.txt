The film is set in Newcastle at Tyne in north east England, the city where I was born and raised. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it presents the city, the children, but above all the city's men. In this movie, they are all stupid, violent, twentieth, bullies. I suppose I could comment on the plot (predictably), the notions (competitively unattractive), the direction (lazy and imaginative), but for me, it is all irrelevant to the director's insult to the city and its people. <br /> <br /> Thus, the call in my summary for the director and author, Mark Herman, to leave the Northeast.
