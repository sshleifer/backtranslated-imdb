If there was ever a movie that could be considered a missed opportunity, then the movie is Galaxina. What could be wrong by basing a sci-fi movie around a sexy statuesque woman android? Surely such a movie could never be a complete waste of time? Well, unfortunately, this movie is pretty close to useless. There are a number of errors with this production, it must be said, but there are two basic problems that completely destroy the entire business. First of all, this is a comedy with no fun bits or at least a movie where the potentially entertaining aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. Secondly, the title character is heavily underused. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but if so, it was a horrible decision as she is still the best thing about the movie. I don't think she really needed to be a good thespian to pull the role of a sexy android to be honest. Still, what we are left with is a lot of mind-numbing comedy relief, which often consists of hopeless spoof-type gags of the great sci-fi hits of the time like Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It is poorly written and not Fun at all, and it doesn't even have a plot to push things together. The story is basically about a police room spider sent to get a rock. That is it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in a sentence. What he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - meaningless? <br /> <br /> This seemed like a safe burning winner for me, but it failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to forge Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All that is actually achieved is to leave you cold and a little annoyed that it was not close to what it should have been. A barbarella for the 80s is not. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this movie was completed, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terribly violent and horrible way. And therefore, Galaxina has derived a significant part of its cult interest. I just think it's a big shame that Dorothy didn't have a better movie back to immortalize her.
