This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentional hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9 because it can be so bad, so terrible, so stupid, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with this is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood and don't be honest and say I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's see it from the forbidden love between Peck (who eventually slumbers it. Although in all fairness it was still a couple of years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgetful, apparently that I forgot her name.) To the final scene where the good guys dress like monks to fool the evil screams "ROBIN HOOD" over it. <br /> <br /> But I don't think movies are not worth seeing. On the contrary, I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year, even though it was accidental.
