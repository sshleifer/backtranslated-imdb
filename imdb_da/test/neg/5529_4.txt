Victor Jory was never a big star. He is better known for later character roles than for his early leader. But he was very nice and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure game are passionate. Their kisses look very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Osborne is also a standout. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The print I saw was not ready. But what a joy that rare movies like this turns up! And they are still intact in some form of monitoring conditions. This is nothing special. But if you are willing to sail through movies in his era with similarly exciting titles, you will probably find some suprtb movies.
