Hi! Grudge 2! What up, man? I have a friend I would like you to meet. Grudge 2 meets with Johnny's Worst of 2006 list. Johnny's worst of 2006 list meets The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What happens here? I was under the impression that this should be a successor to The Grudge rather than a remake. If so, why does it do nothing but refresh the original? This floater doesn't even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick that makes it annoyingly sounding. <br /> <br /> A sound that I would recommend to you doesn't make me start. It was a little scary the first time I heard it, but I have heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it is pretty much going on. And it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it would be fun to imitate the sound when there was a quiet place in the movie. Sigh. People, you're not fun, so you just shut! I promise you every time a character went slowly through an empty space (which is about 97% of the movie), someone in the audience would start it up, "Uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk." Yes, I know it's a terrible way to replicate the sound with letters, but you get the core. Then some guy in the audience will giggle and not be outdated, delivering his own rendering. I was very close to just going through the audience and slumbering people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to get started. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There is not a single original scare or idea throughout the movie. There is not a memorable play. Are you Sarah Michelle Gellar's fan? Welp, enjoy her two-minute screen time and a line of dialogue. Are you an Amber Tamblyn fan? I hope you can cope with the fact that she has nothing more to do than walk around and look like she is suffering from a broken nerve. Can you believe the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than The Grudge's? <br /> <br /> At least, the original was pretty creepy and boasted of a few effective jumping scenes. I didn't even jump under this lameness (yes, I made the word, handle it). It is true. Not a single time. "Scares" are then made and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value when the "gotcha" moment arrives. Watching this movie is like playing a good chess game - you're always four or five scenes ahead. <br /> <br /> There are also some strange scenes thrown in that don't make sense. One who immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back in the jar. Huh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of it during the movie. Laughing. Sigh. Shake the head. Falling asleep (I did twice). <br /> <br /> The movie even makes a 1/5/5 heart test on a plot "twist". Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should even dignify it by noticing it a twist. Do they really think anyone would be surprised at the revelation of who's hiding under a hoodie? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And of course, the whole non-closed "look we can have another sequel" ends. As soon as the credits rolled the audience booed. My feelings exactly. Had the public paid money for this turd burger, it would probably be fierce and I would be happy to direct the tax. <br /> <br /> We learned from Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a vigorous grip of anger, a curse is left. Like a Ben Affleck movie, it is a "spot" that forever becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well in The Grudge 2, we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during the opening weekend, its successor is rushed out, and more often than not, it will be as bad as this and will leave a spot on any theater where movie shows. <br /> <br /> The Gist <br /> <br /> If you are a total wimp and never saw The Grudge then this can give a few cheap scares. But I strongly recommend saving money, otherwise there is a good chance that you will be the one who leaves the theater with an angry.
