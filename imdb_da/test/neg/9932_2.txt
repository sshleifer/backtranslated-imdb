I caught this on HBO under its category of "Guilty Pleasures" and I agreed that I felt guilty (and pleasured) to see it. One, it's trash can, and really raunchy trash can. Two, the plot is slow and predictable, and when you learn "who did it", you think "so what?". However, I must admit that I am probably of a male chauvinist pig who wants to sit through what is, of course, a bad movie, if it is nothing more than to see that Peta Wilson is completely naked a number of times. Do I feel dirty to have seen it? Yes. Am I sorry I saw it? No. So there's the contrast between being a lover of good movies and a lover of female anatomy, even in a bad movie. Sigh!
