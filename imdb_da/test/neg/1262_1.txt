Have you ever wondered what is the worst movie ever made? Stop wondering. I'm telling you, Michael is! <br /> <br /> It's not "heartwarming", "entertaining" or "Travolta at its best." It just sucks. If I had children, I'd let them see Deep Throat before Michael! <br /> <br /> A sold out John Travolta, a rinsed and bald William Hurt, and one by dying ever now Jean Stapleton highlights this turd of a movie. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell sing! Yes. Hollywood is really everywhere with us here!
