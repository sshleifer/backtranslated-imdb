First I want to say that I am liberal on the political scale, and I found the film offensive. I managed to see the whole doggone disgrace of a movie. This movie brings a low to original ideas. Yes it was original and thus my 2 stars instead of 1. Are our film authors so motionless that they can only come up with this ?? The action was horrible, and the characters were mostly inappropriate. The main lady in history had no good properties at all. They made her a kind of bad guy, and I didn't see it at all. Maybe I missed something, I don't know. He was the most down to earth, relevant character in the movie. I have not spoken any money for this waste. I almost want PETA to come to the rescue of this horrible, offensive movie and make a protest. PROMOTING that is all I have to say!
