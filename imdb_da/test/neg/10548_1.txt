The poisonous Avenger ... The idea of ​​this movie is that a person whom the common people would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste mutated into a superhero that is totally disfigured sounded OK himself for 1985. This film is listed as a horror ... I even read a cult follow with this series .... Now this movie itself is given as it was made so bad that I couldn't stop see ... the play is terrible even for an independent movie, which I think was the scare of this movie ... drug dealing, sumo Godzilla entrance .... I'm all for movies that promote anti-drugs .. heck i like godzilla and good sumo ... i'm not in it but i still believe that the sumo heights would love to give this movie the 1000 towel and ground salt in the eyes of the people who made this movie. .. Personally, I'm almost ready to write to the movie company that did this and ask them for it t For me, 1 in 10 is too high, it is too bad that there is no 0 (zero) or even negative integers to place on a movie here. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie is JUNK ...... would rather watch paint dare and deal with explosive diarrhea, then you should see this movie ever again ... I would be the first person That would use not only the packaging of this movie as kindling, but I would be up for a good'ol movie and script burning.
