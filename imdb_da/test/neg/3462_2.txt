OK, where do I start? I saw a screening a few weeks ago and I was shocked at how bad this movie is. Sure you just love Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best TV shows in the air, then you will definitely love this movie. I personally like George's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy, and I'm sure he is great and fun to work with personally but comedy, he can't pull it out on the big screen. It was a cute movie, but would I pay $ 12.00 to see it? H&L no !!!! Now that I've seen it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone spending their money. George, buddy, I love you, but please do no more comedies? This script lacks much, good concept, but just didn't.
