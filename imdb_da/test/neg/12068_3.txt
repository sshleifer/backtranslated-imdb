Apparently, the author and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher is a fan of 13 and other summer camp slashers. This movie has it all - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend of fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", the old man who warns them not to go there; And of course the crazy killer with machete who keeps slashing and hacking on teenagers for no reason. Whole things could have worked if it had been shot on 35mm film with acceptable special effects. But instead, the special effects are badly made. The murderer walks around as if he is out on a Sunday afternoon stroll, and the only good things about this movie is the play of the talented starring and gender scene in the beginning. Other than that - boring and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan
