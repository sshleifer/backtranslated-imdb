I should have gone without watching the movie after reading the review here. I watched the whole movie fast and ended in 25 minutes. Even though it is a low budget film, it could have been better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts more like a thriller and in minutes it tells you to shut down immediately. And why was the movie called "crash landing", as it was landed so well in such a bad climate. <br /> <br /> Without any play, all the characters just moving or doing like the kids. <br /> <br /> And don't forget to comment on joker - the biggest hijacker who would have been more suited if this movie was a full time comedy.
