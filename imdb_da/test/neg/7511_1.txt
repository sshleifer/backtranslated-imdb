I watched this movie in a cinema club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants were from the local private school where I learned. I had seen a few Godard movies earlier while living in France, and although they had not been my favorites, at least I could make sense of them. Being able to speak French helped. The rather innocent beginning of "Le week-end" soon became a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps too well photographed, it soon gave me no sense. For me, movies, like books, must have a clear sense of meaning. This didn't do for me. I suppose I'm not "into" artistic films. Pictures still span me from the movie. To this day, I refuse to eat rabbit meat, loved by the French. Those who have seen the movie may realize why. Yes, the theme of materialism came through, but cannibalism, the car wreck and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only hurt me. I'm not sure I went out before the end, but I certainly wanted it. I promised myself that I would never see another Godard movie, and I have not and never will. <br /> <br /> My rating: Nothing. It was the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. Others may have been more incomplete, stupid or stupid. I have forgotten them, while scenes from this will haunt me forever.
