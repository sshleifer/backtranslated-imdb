When I heard Disney had the rights to "Underdog," I would at least be a good Pixar partnership and we would get a great Adult & Kids movie like "The Incredibles". Alas ... I forgot how Disney will stupid classic material for today's dumbed down youth. What did they think? "Underdog" was a product of the 60s, your Prime Fanbase is in their 40s and 50s, why should you turn it into 5-year-olds? It should have been done ala "Roger Rabbit", half animated half genuine. Instead, we get characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF !!) dumbed in another dog. "Underdog" cannot have an "energy pill" as we are now so "enlightened" it would obviously be a steroid or drug television. The only good casting was Patrick Warburton as "Cad", because he actually looks like the cartoon version. Otherwise, old school "Underdog" fans should avoid this as the plague it is. What's next? A live-action version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a visionary history lesson? (My advanced excuses if Disney jumps on this!)
