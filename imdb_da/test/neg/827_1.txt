I have absolutely no idea why I saw Ali G Indahouse except that Salon seemed to believe a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for an Emmy for his work on the Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never see that show as there was absolutely no fun about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like it. It was just about the dumbest thing I was all watching. I will admit that I was fascinated by Rhona Mitra. I hadn't seen her in anything. She was not on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I think I will have to check out Boston Legal one of those evenings to see how she is doing something that might be worth seeing.
