Tolerate! Antoine Monot, in a copycat imitation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking, but author / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, the underestimated old-school bard of "There is something about Mary" fame, would grace any small town dropout story. In a visual lure, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cold enough on his tan-six-series BMW door, which carries aviator shades where no place goes. True * he accidentally sleeps with his wild-eyed bohemian nephew (Marie Zielcke), but who wouldn't? Thumbs up also on how he goes black-and-white on a liberal dose of the mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you are looking for a more serious representation of what poisoning can do for you, I suggest you check out "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".
