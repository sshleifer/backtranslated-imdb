Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her on the important subject and trying to make a good movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: She is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect, and that is the energy she constantly radiates, giving credibility to the often abused expression "star". <br /> <br /> The film misses its brand for many different reasons, but perhaps most for history's apparent on-screen unadaptability, making it a compelling story ... more about that later. Thrown at first glance is excellent, but come to think of it, Jessica Lang as the Jewish mother is too protestant and not quite right, Ann Hetch does not come close to showing the psychiatrist's compassion and commitment from the book and When you make a movie, How can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the film's construction: first in the lack of inducing any kind of persistent sympathy for the Elizabeth Wurtzle character and secondly saying something meaningful about the all too common and terrible situation that this poor girl finds itself in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for the flashback construction, Lizzy only comes out as surely more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she gets into the book. This is a big problem. This story had to be told from the beginning to the end and from the therapist's sofa. She is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors, both in society and in the home, and this is a crucial point in not only inducing the right sympathy for her, but also the gravitas of her case. She is so talented and such a vulnerable and unaffected spirit so early that one's heart cannot help reach out to her because of her victims. This has missed the movie. In the end, you have to understand what the film is trying to say: it is a biopic of a severely hit girl, but also it is a movie about a nation who cannot get his action together it is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the movie where the one picked at Harvard is even more messy than the average college enrollee. The movie is finally unable to get one of these messages compulsory, and it's too bad. Is Prozac a good thing, or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or an apparent necessity in a country where so many people cannot function without a chemical crutch? These are tough and challenging concepts to work with, and writing does not attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image that symbolizes a dysfunctional America, but it does not have the effect it is supposed to have due to the cross-cutting and insufficient past development of controlling themes. Ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt and one of the best of his acting career. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also great in his role.
