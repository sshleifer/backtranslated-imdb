This movie has no plot. It was SUPPOSED to be a guy moving in with his grandmother and everyone thinks he is a loser and he must redeem himself. But what happens after everyone, out of who he lives with? they have a large pot party at Grandma's house. The climax of the movie wasn't even related to the rest of it. that the whole plot was introduced within minutes of the film's end. I can see how it might have been related to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG skills redeem him - but it just wasn't there. <br /> <br /> But the movie was fun as hell and was clear because of the jokes. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy smells like the big depression" "He just sucked his first titty ... yes for 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's the devil"
