Right for video and for good reason. Its like the neighborhood kids put on a game in the backyard, but worse. A young man (Don Digiulio) inherits a farm in West Virginia that has been dormant for generations. He decides to take a few friends to check the property. This farmland used to produce good corn crops, even during the Great Depression. The secret is that the owner murdered people and watered the fields with their blood. Then hang their bodies out as scarecrows. The special effects are rather paralyzed and the dreadful dialogue is full of unfunny one-liners and banter so ridiculous that the sound can be better off. Cheap gore and a shame of a horror flick. Together with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
