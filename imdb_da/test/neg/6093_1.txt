If you make a thrill movie, it is so important that the "villain" is not more sympathetic than the "victim". And it doesn't fail. It was so horrible and frustrating to see that I was actually moved to register and comment. OK, so the man is rich and cocky. There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife show plenty. The man is a dunk because he did not approve the cabana boy who physically attacked the woman - the witch who had nothing to do with the plot of BTW. The cabana boy threatens the man and repeatedly tries to seduce the wife. He then forces herself on her - as the woman finds so hot, she stops thinking about rape and begins to think she wants him. Uh huh. The misogynistic, subordinate complex thoughts shown by the instructor are just disgusting. It's a thing when a nice movie like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathize with the villain, but in Survival Island I felt like watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director failed to make him unbearable and instead made us hate his victims. What did he think ???
