I was really disappointed with this movie, which I had great hopes for. It seems to have been rushed to take advantage of the success of scrubbing comedies at that time (including MGM's own "abandoned Lady", which contained two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years in their mating, they were still attractive to see and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak manuscript and hasty premise ruin any chance that it will be a good follow-up to the previous year's "abandoned Lady" and the two Thin Man "movie they had made prior to this. "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, Myrna Loy, who intends to dominate the lives of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beal) and her own servants (including Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon). When the independent sprout William Powell enters her life, Loy has met her fight by distracting Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control. Sounds good so far, right? Yes, an interesting achievement falls short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so one-dimensional, it's hard to even like her, let alone see Powell fall in love with her, as we know, will soon happen. It's another attempt to put a career-minded woman in her place by changing her view of her, what kind of life she's been doing, something Hollywood often did in her golden age. When Loy says she doesn't have time for both to run her business and have a husband in her life, it's a groaner. Fortunately, other than Powell, there is free-hearted Jessie Ralph on board. A salty wealthy elderly woman who helped Loy start her business, she is acquainted with Powell and can immediately see through Loy's cool claims that she is due him. Rice and Beal is a boring couple, and all of Powell's perception of getting between them is pointless. Then an ex-wife from Powell's shows is up, which is really not necessary at the late point in history, and the final wedding scene (where the crowd is trying to get into Powell's little trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (It's fun that Powell is still hit by things that meant by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy; these chuckles are very welcome as there are so few others.) Powell and Loy would do better in two later screw-basketball campaigns, " I love you again "and" Love Crazy ", sophisticated, witty and funny. This movie tries to be all three, but ends with a sophisticated drilling.
