This version of David Copperfield is horrible from start to finish. I knew we were in for a wasted evening view when it was pretty silly to surrender Attenborough and Olivier camp it as two wicked ones. It was completely downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was sufficient but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for. The worst of the worst was the manufacturer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed fear from David. Dickens must have rolled in his grave to see his favorite children turned into a wimp crying in his beer. Once upon a time, Hollywood knew more than jolly old England.
