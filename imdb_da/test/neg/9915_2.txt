A wasted effort. On the surface it is a typical disaster movie: we are involved in a few people who are caught in the Big Event. But the script is so terrible, and there is so much explanation for the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we are treated as morons. Even Sesam Street did not explain the origin of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died: we can work it out. Someone thought entering 'Enron' in the script would give the currency when discussing power companies. The plot is virtually bland, except for the older artists (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour I couldn't care for who the storms went out. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to look at. Unfortunately no. Even on a 20-year-old TV set, I could see that a tractor and trailer were computer-generated otherwise bad. Maybe there are budget constraints so I can forgive one. Recordings of a plane trying to land looked pretty right, but I kept telling myself that I had seen it before. This site confirms it: it was from a previous movie, nowhere to land. So in summary, the only good bits from another movie, and when you see the best action sequences compressed to a 30 second network promo, make category 6 look pretty good. My advice: Trust your network to make some good 30 second clips, watch them and save yourself two nights.
