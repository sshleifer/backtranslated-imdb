This movie is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I get angry at TCM to show this mess more often than Bachelor Mother, the lovely original. I am becoming increasingly angry that some Hollywood boobs thought it would be a good idea to reclaim Bachelor Mother, fill it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a sweet comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent time, money, energy and talent wasted on this awful remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother (the original) with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew that simulates sexuality. It's a 1930's look at the Hays Office. Bundle of Joy (remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher being strictly milk and cakes. It is a 1950s handshake with Eisenhower. Which one would you rather see - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, each member of the cast in the original version is far superior to his / her counterpart in remake. <br /> <br /> In the original is a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers on her top. David Niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat pampered, sophisticated yet immersed scion of a wealthy department store magnet. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in a movie. In the bachelor mother, he is invaluable as the desperate grandfather wannabe. <br /> <br /> In the Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky self. She is fine in this role, even though her performance (along with Fisher's) alters the tone of history completely. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He is completely missing the screen "presence". Here he is far too healthy for this story. His plays are completely gentle and clueless. Likewise, his song is so bland and incredible that it has been completely forgotten by the world as a whole. The only time he is not quite painful is in Butterfield 8 - where he does not sing. Here's Fisher's lame performance alone enough to destroy this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, delivers a competent performance but not one of his best. He is more blushing than commander. He and Fisher are not convincing as a father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see musical music, is history just random? Or watch a musical for a story, with some (crowded) good music for spices? If the former, you like this lame remake. Otherwise, you are much better off seeing the non-musical original Ginger Rogers, Bachelor Mother.
