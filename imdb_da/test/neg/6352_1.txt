Bought this movie for a dollar and figured I could never go wrong, my big mistake looked at it. Enjoyed the play by Ice-T and rapping that gave lots of class to this movie about Los Angeles and the world of pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and has a career, but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he goes back. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in their trade, and make sure they are not opened up. This boxer falls in love with the boss's boyfriend and all sorts of problems start. This is entertaining and it becomes a great laugh comedy.
