Foolish and violent thriller that is a rip-off of 'Deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence. The reason is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and eager to be free of this unpleasant entry. This film is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James live in a mess like this.
