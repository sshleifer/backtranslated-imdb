This movie is by far one of the worst B movies I've ever seen. There are no plot phrases at all. The play is decent, but the story is horrible. There are also many flaws in the movie and it was bothersome to see. For any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies or even B movies, I don't recommend it to anyone at all. Most of the film is focused on meaningless killing in ways that are not even worth discussing. This movie may well be compared to a crappy remake of Jeepers Creepers, which was also not so great of a movie. For anyone who wants to spend a day at home, sees badly made movies, it takes the cake.
