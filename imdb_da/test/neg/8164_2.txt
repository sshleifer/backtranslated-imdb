I love movies, all genres and from big dollar glasses to small indie projects. But even considering that this piece of junk is 25 years and its attempt to pay tribute to the 1950s, it just suffers in almost the aspect where we judge film. Throughout the film, I was reminded of several "student films" I have had a chance to see, stakes where creativity is required to fill gaps where funds are needed. <br /> Overall, there are chances that there are much better uses in 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 2/10
