Just awful. It is almost unbelievable that with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a plodding, passionless mishmash could result. But it's TV for you - filler between advertisements. The first warning signal sounds from the early recreation that screams "1928" in banner type. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and vests, cloches and speakeasy jazz (jarringly played) - with all the attention to pointless, arty details, the important things are ignored. <br /> <br /> As narrative clarity or plausibility, or competent writing and action. The reason puts one of Hammett's operators ("Hamilton Nash", so whether he is called "Ham" or "Nash", we think of "Hammett" or "Dash") examining a false diamond theft. Thus is introduced the young woman who apparently wears Dain Curse (the charming and talented Nancy Addison who went back to the soap where she belonged); she belongs to a crackpot religious cult led by Jean Simmons and also seems dependent on "drugs"; There is also a mysterious gaseous medicine that seeps into the rooms .... But enough. The scripture is never more pedestrian than when it reaches the poetic or high-winged, and cast parrots are the only way they know: how to gruntly overtake. Simmons are treated like small royalties from Old Hollywood, but the neighboring lady does not wash. Hector Elizondo for some reason enjoys another billing (after Coburn) for a dispensable portion. Other known faces glide through and do a little good for their resumes. <br /> <br /> The actors are not even photographed to look good; Jason Miller is a particular fear, but extreme close-ups of Coburn are also relentless. Coburn probably coagulated this role because he with mustache has a strong resemblance to Hammett. He needed more guidance than that; No one has given him the watchful hint of how to play his character or of the tone of history or about how the different threads of the plot mesher together (they do not at least not in this story). Then he flashes his big Chesire cat laugh, whether it is being called on or not. <br /> <br /> Dain Curse is available on video tapes of various lengths. For the stupid enough to "see for themselves", the shortest abbreviation is the best of all.
