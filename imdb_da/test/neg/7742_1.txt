Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, cheesy, fun way. Even MST3K couldn't stop it from being boring and it's also confusing as everyone goes out. But the most annoying part of this boring mess is Ireland's hideous high-altitude voice, which I was tired of listening to for the first five minutes. Not to mention how truly unappealing her character is. Even her father ran away and left her! I can see why, honestly. If he wanted her in her little mouse voice for more than a couple of minutes, he would have been tempted to do much harm to her. As I was at the end of the movie. Plus, she is useless and annoying. When she falls into the long hole in the ground and laid Alice in Wonderland, she would have been finished in the first ten minutes if the inexplicable Australian acclaimed miner had not saved her from all the various light sources she was falling into i. He should just have tied her to the Atlantic version of the train track and finished it. And this Atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density, I have to ask where did the light come from? Did they have generators that mimic the sun? Does not matter. There is no real plot anyway, just a bunch of strange costumed Goth wannabees running around trying to catch Kathy (probably so they can keep a gag in their mouths). Stupid, meaningless movie. Thanks Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. May you burn in Hell's seventh forever.
