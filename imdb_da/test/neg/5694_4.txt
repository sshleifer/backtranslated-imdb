I'm willing to tolerate almost anything in a Sci-Fi movie, but it was almost unacceptable. While a few special effects are very cool (landscapes), it is not a "battlespace" rather an incoherent weird mother / daughter relationship with the sci-fi concepts cast. The play (wood), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with "hand-to-hand" battle scenes more fun than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie, this movie is drilled. The plot line coincides, and the devices used to move the plot together (tell), inexplicable stage games and lots of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that the author's director is not a good idea. Save your love for Sci-Fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.
