Oh, I'm mostly not that kind of person giving a movie less than 5 points. Mostly just because of the efforts of actors and directors. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for Keyman from me. If anyone thinks that the protagonist (or one) deserves an Oscar, I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. <br /> <br /> Seriously. I can't believe this movie made it to Europe. The play was horrible, the plot was terrible and what about 70's horror music. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> "Popeye" e.g. What about him? Why is he there, he has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> And what about Keymans talking. Once he can't say a proper word, next time he'll get talky talk. He also dies almost when he wakes up and some sunlight shines through his piles. But when he walks down the street, the sunlight does not look like anything. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie you are on the verge of dying of boredom. I'm sorry for not seeing my roses grow, which is at least more entertaining than this piece ...
