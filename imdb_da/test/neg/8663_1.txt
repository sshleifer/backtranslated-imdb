I agree with several of you that this movie was a bit boring and boring. I did not like myself to the protagonist and the following actors / actresses who came into the scene. The camera work was not pleasant. Random shots and shaking movie scenes made me quite annoyed, and I turned off the movie. I will make my time by watching the 1999 adaptation and hope it fits in with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Become Jane; and pride and prejudice. I only have a few others to watch over these movies, but I think they were done in good taste. The music was also out of place with the movie and remind me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and a BBC show. I came across it one night on the internet. I liked the first season, but the second season was dry and took things out of thin air that would stay with the clouds. I found the most important male character that was Henry in this movie out of place. Maybe I just don't like his way of speaking or his stature. Well, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they were supposed to subdue them, and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era or the way homes were held at that time. Again I want to see the 1999 version and hope it's a better one and make Jane Austen some justice for her writing.
