Even though this begins promising, a woman in a car weaves around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest, until she almost hits a man with a lizard! This gave me the impression that we should see something special, something almost David Lynchian (if there is such a concept), but unfortunately the movie starts to go everywhere and not have a core center, just a kind of enchanting story about a woman trying to solve a mystery in a small town. The character survey goes everywhere and I couldn't really care for any of the signs it looks like, especially when some of the story suddenly goes into flashback mode. I had some hopes for this movie, but overall it was a bit of a letdown.
