I had heard that this movie was stylish and exciting, but I just found it annoying. It's been a while since I've seen it (and hopefully I won't find out all my memories are wrong and I condemn this movie unfairly), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victim of an anti-gay community and that this somehow caused their terrible crime. I totally disagree with this view and think it is unfair for both gay and Bobby Franks, the real victim of history. I can't imagine why anyone would want to claim the two as martyrs. I also thought L & L was portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were - after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film puts them in a kind of fantasy world that seems to have scored by Morrissey. <br /> <br /> I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that included the film's anachronism, such as The push-button phones used by the characters were supposed to "add Brechtian distance". They do it safely but I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a number of people found this movie interesting, but I would have preferred a less "stylish" and more realistic study of the part homosexuality may have played in Leopold & Loeb's case.
