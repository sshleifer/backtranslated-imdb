I recently rented this promising mini-series, I didn't even know they had adapted it to TV. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot looks just like the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there is some appalling play. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think TV budgets just aren't big enough for a decent fit of this spectacular book. Forsyth deserves much, much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book, which is a must-read.
