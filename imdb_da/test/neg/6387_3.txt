An absolutely enchanting western with flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum, the South of Hell Mountain was one of the first films produced by schlockmeisters at Cannon Film. Co-registered by William Sachs, who will later deliver such fanatics as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxy, the film tells the very boring story of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who store some secrets that is not worth discovering. Cast (most of them never made another movie) try gamely, but are hamstrung by the manuscript, which generally doesn't make sense. The asylum scenes are edited to a little effect and are characterized by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. In the end, it is very talk and a little different.
