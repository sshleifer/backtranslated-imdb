As someone already said, the living dead dolls were cute, and if they came out as a new series of wicked little things, I would buy one or two. Oh well, this movie was dark, not in frightening sense, but in that I can't see any way. And it was boring. Three females in a house, the youngest told not to enter the forest under any circumstances (it was not sinking in) and it would have been better if that advice had involved their death. And if anyone does no cleaning or laundering or anything, you would believe that many coughs would occur. A sexy young mother where you waste your time trying to calculate her age (by my calculations 34 or 36). And it looked like it had been more than 20 years since someone had lived there so what were with fathers young adult pictures on very older albums? I'm so tired of clichés that are just lazy writing, and here they come thick and fast. Teens are stoned and drunk by car, and you know where it leads .... death and apparently deafness, as Tim seems ignorant of his friends screaming. I think I have pushed many a car where the instructors did not scream and I heard them. Cliché strange man in the forest, nobody believes. Plumber who has lived in them there for many years, and is his first experience with the mentioned children, so he is passing by and he avoids exchanging youth in night blood. Run him over you idiot! Cliché ... roaming in the forest without a clue where you go, armed with the knowledge that pick-ax wielding children (yes those again) are out. Ruthless scene brutalization of pigs ... why do so many directors see no problem with animal mutilation and slaughter? I would very much have seen the kiddies run up and bite people on their thighs than this. Zombies don't seem to have that much energy in other movies. The villain, how inactive was he? His big part was in the store. Stomped in and demanded to be served first. What an eventful man he was. Why not kill him before the family came and avoid the film being made or replaying it differently. I give my marks to the house, the forest and the little Goth dollies I want one!
