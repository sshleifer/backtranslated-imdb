It's hard to express how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, when intellectual search for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical conveniences, clean clothes, hair clippings, etc. Was a common reaction to the middle-class classes in both the United States and Western Europe, this film would have been a stinker. The reason is a mishmash of several ones ex machina (if it is the right Latin grammar); the play consists of dead peaks broken by occasional hysteria (of both male and female); The free view of Catherine Deneuve's (or any) breasts is worthy of a Budweiser commercial; the repetitive cacaphonous orchestral repetition in the abandoned building I am certainly heavy with meaning in the director's mind, but for me just a more stupid symbol thrown into this senseless movie - I ranting because my time is wasted and watching this scam excuse for an artificial tile. The landscape is beautiful and the sex scene is warm - but under his clothes this king has no substance.
