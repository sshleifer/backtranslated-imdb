A complete and complete destruction of my precious two hours. The whole movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds just by showing that people are getting cold, a car crashing, people getting more cattle, people having sex, people crying and people getting more cattle. The tagline for this movie should have read "Come and see how f * cked up our characters are! They are stony! They are cook abusers! They are a mess! Who are these people? Don't you really care? Just give us your money because we definitely don't care about anything else! "A completely horrible movie. It never went anywhere, you never got to know the signs (they never even said what these people did to make a big house and so much money and cars and coke) and it was just as boring. You may like the movie a little more if you are a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us who are not, this movie is a waste of film and time.
