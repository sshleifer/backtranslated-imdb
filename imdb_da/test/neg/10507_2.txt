As I said, sometimes low budget is good. You will see a good movie without many of the extra BS that can hide another piece of crap. Well ... that was that kind of shit. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately humor was unintentional. The only half-witted play came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (it's a joke). There was never Bill Smith, nor was anyone able to act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he has been thrown into nearly 40 movies. The battle scenes were comical and made me feel like I could kick all their $% # @ # $. The sound was horrible as if all the sound was recorded on the set. My 10 year old could have written a better script ... BTW, my 10 year old fell asleep ... no fun. I give a B + for editing to cut the movie for only 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
