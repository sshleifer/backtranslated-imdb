I love Japanese movies - have seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious I'm not afraid of Japanese movies. But sometimes there are Japanese concepts for movies that just don't translate well into Westerners. They can be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem to, well ... normally. It's like the live fish, my wife ate at a business meeting or weird PS2 games like dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably the way others look at things that Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Now, the King of strange Japanese movies, who just don't seem to be right for Americans, might just be ATAMA-YAMA. Now the animation style is not the problem - it is different than good enough. No, it is the concept of history itself and the rather bizarre end. That's what makes this a really unusual movie, and it goes like this: There was a stingy man who, without apparent reason, had a tree grow out of his head. It was only at first, and he just cut it away, but again and again it grew back - so he decided to let it go. And after a while people began to live upside down under the shade of the tree. Strangely, while they were under the tree, they were small, but when they left, they were in full size again. Then the man drowned himself (!) In the hole in the top of the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> Look! I told you it was very, very strange - but not in a good way like TAMPOPO or KATAKURIS LYKKE - just odd. O-D-D .... weird! And unless you have a very high tolerance for this kind of thing, I doubt whether you will feel bad knowing that this Oscar nominated movie doesn't win. Frankly, it makes me happy because I really don't want this movie to spur similar movies. The only reason it serves a 4 is due to good but not spectacular animation. <br /> <br /> This movie hurt my brain .... I hope this is not a sign that I have a tree!
