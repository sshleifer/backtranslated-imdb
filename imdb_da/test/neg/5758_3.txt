This was bad enough. I really hope there is no successor. Maybe it gives away part of the plot to tell you it's open to the opportunity, but no, it's not. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing special about this movie. Now the special effect was quite good, but nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> There were some hot babes in her, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to see people. PG-13, definitely not an R. It also tells you that the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. The shovel for the head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame scare fare.
