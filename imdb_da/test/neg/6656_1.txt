I haven't seen Ishtar, but I had the accident by watching Kevin Costner's Postman, this is worse. Perhaps the absolutely worse piece of waste I've ever seen and if you look at my review for the Moulin Rouge? It says something. Bad plot, plays were substandard and even wasted (though Michael Keaton has been in some of the worst movies I've ever seen) and this movie has no redeeming value for anyone with more than half a brain. DO NOT SEE IF YOU HAVE GRADE THE 4th GRADE, as you will find this an insult to your intelligence.
