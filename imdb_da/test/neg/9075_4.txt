I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl and two boys. When I lived this situation and got lost in it, I hope a similar story would inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) & How (b) Triangular? - Why (c) & How (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The movie gives a general answer: "because it's better!". <br /> <br /> (b) here is an open triangle: the three share things together. Mine was closed: everyone knows the others, but never the three are together or talk about the missing: <br /> <br /> (c) The movie does not offer spoken explanations, but rather prefers visual and emotional assumptions: The end comes with sensuality , sexuality comes up in the triangle, or more precisely, when for a member deep emotions are bound by intimacy, and as for the latter and the former, they can be divided. I agree. <br /> <br /> (d) In the movie & in my story, silence is proof that something is not good. And in an ironic and painful way, the tool at these sad times is always the phone: I lived this terribly planned phone call: "Call me back: I'm waiting for you" ?? And when the time comes, the phone is silent. A variation is also displayed when the line is connected, but you refuse to speak ?? All these scenes were very hard to see for me. <br /> <br /> If the movie was a great help in that way, he also got many mistakes: <br /> <br /> - I zapped on the boy's family issues <br /> <br /> - why the shower scene on The DVD cover is cut into the film? <br /> <br /> - How does Mickael finally get into the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Is Cl√©ment Always Looking At Salome? he says "no" but has his address; and who is the girl with him in the bar: his girlfriend? how can she know about the address ??? <br /> <br /> What finally happens to Vanessa: The ring of last shot is evidence of commitment ??? with whom ?????
