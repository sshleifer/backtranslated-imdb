It claims to be Paul's Apostle's life. It opens with him who is involved in a loin-cloth wrestling match with a priest. The Pharisees were called because they "separated" from Hellenism, were forced upon the Jews by their Gentiles. The point is that Saul would never have been involved in Greek-Roman wrestling. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we've shown the two men (Saul and the priest, Reuben - a completely extra-fictional fictional character) washed down in the nude in a Roman style house. Again, the Torah, which Saul followed religiously, strongly condemned and considered another man's key. <br /> <br /> Reuben turns out to be the one who pushes Saul to destroy the church. Again, the scripture does not matter, for they are PAUL who says he was releasing the church and breathing out threatened and slaughtered against the church. <br /> <br /> The movie shows Barnabas "sprinkling" Paul - not baptizing (immersing) him when the scriptures say it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> There is no mention of Mark or his returns, so the writer's writers are forced to have Paul and Barnabas argue over Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of their separation. No Silas on Paul's second and third mission; No Timothy ... EVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, no, no! James is said to have known "Jesus for a long time" rather than saying that the scripture text makes him the brother of Jesus. Why not just call the movie "Frank, the Fictional Apostle?!?" At least it would be closer to the scripture.
