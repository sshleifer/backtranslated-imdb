I remember reading that Darwin had a decisive experience on the Galapagos Islands when he experienced the great animal life there and internally, writing his evolutionary theory. Not according to this film it was inspired by the British landscape. OK, and as John Cleese would say-right-. I also didn't think Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and a person who suffered dark reveries and anxiety flights. According to this film, he was. It is boring that he apparently lost one of his daughters for illness, but I do not think he loses a family member would have greatly affected man's scientific abilities. Well, not according to ... you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science becomes a fable, and to a degree this film comes out as trying to mitigate the theory of evolution by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, which for me is just rough. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of the scientific study, cool and calm, and always thinking logically. This film seeks to dramatize the uranium and sensationalize clear scientific research. It's like a Canterbury Tale. I would not recommend it.
