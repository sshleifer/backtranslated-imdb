First of all, I would like to make it clear that I voluntarily submit myself to the display of terrible movies. I've seen what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my mind, movies could not be worse than similar by D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The pirate movie, without exaggeration, is the WORST FILM IN THE WORLD. I was informed in advance to see that the movie was actually horrible, but I didn't believe in the allegations. Believe me when I tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to movies. It starts with a 3 minute clip of a pirate boat apparently in the midst of a fight with itself. The "end" splashes over the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the movie. The film is about an unpopular, eerie nerdy girl named Mabel, who carries around a ghettoblast and is attracted to ambiguous gay pirate girls. She drowns and has an excessively pronounced hallucination, where she lies like a gently dressed shank that falls in love with Frederic, who happened to have just crawled out of the sea. He can actually be gay. The pirate king has a ruby ​​and diamond-studded codpiece. It laughs and cries when he squeezes it. <br /> <br /> There is song in this movie. You may get the impression that this is a fun musical. It is not. Trust me. They are the worst songs you have ever heard, and at the end of the first original song you will search for objects that pierce your drumholes. <br /> <br /> There are "references" to other movies in here. Of course, with references, I understand "obvious rip-offs". The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the light bar was actually antihilarious. The dialogue is, in its better moments, painful to hear. The direction is flat out awful and at some point you can see the stunt pillow in the stage, which is not very well hidden at all. <br /> <br /> Finally, if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. There are times when people will see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you cherish your mental capacity, I beg of you, NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE.
