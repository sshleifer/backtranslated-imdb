This is another of those movies I just knew I'd hate, but it didn't end up being as bad as you might expect. It has a lot of T&A in it and even the DVD menu is chocked full of women's breasts. The first few scenes in the movie have a lot of sex and nudity and I began to think that there would be no story whatsoever just to exploit nudity to make money out of a popular prequel 8MM. <br /> <br /> As I continued to see, there were just more sex and nudity and protagonists that I could lessen, but the story began to unfold and I began to see a point on it all and it was a bit better. <Br /> <br /> It's about a man whose fiancé is the daughter of an ambasador and they all have a promising future until naked pictures of a menage a trois sex act turn out and extortion is in the transmitter's cards. The man and his fiancé now have to come to the bottom of who sent the pictures and how to close them. <br /> <br /> The movie is, first and foremost, nothing to part 1, it doesn't even have anything to do with 8MM, it's about a sex video, although I can see the similarities as small as they are. <br /> <br /> The action is neither good nor bad, it is just nobody who plays parts that anyone can do. The film production value is in the middle of the road and its pure drama yawns. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed walking together for the trip that came to the bottom of blackmail's motif. I predict answers that are far more than I could say to the first one I consider garbage. This movie also has some nice phrases that are always welcome. It's not good, and it's very slowly started, but it eventually makes it entertained. I was not on the edge of my seat and I will not rave to my friends that this is a must see, but hi if you see many movies and always looking for something new, this can entertain you for 90 minutes.
