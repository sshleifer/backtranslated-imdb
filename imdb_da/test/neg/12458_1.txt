Why do people make bad movies? Could anyone working in the picture know that what they did did not make sense? There is something about this picture that threw me out, except that I found this "movie" to be unrealistic, pathetic and incorrect. I admire them for the experiment, but the "actors" in the movie sometimes seem to be hard and no one has substance or say anything mildly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I didn't have that option, so it becomes a 1.
