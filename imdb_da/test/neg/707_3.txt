When the movie begins, it's obvious how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is huge, it is Stanley that looks like death heated. Apparently, he was deadly ill during production and had obviously lost much weight. Although he would eventually restore and live for half a decade, he looks like a dying man. In addition, when I watched the movie, I was shocked at how many talked Stan's took - I expected half that he should get rid of the effort. I really can't understand why they came out of retirement given their health - especially when the story and the production values ​​are as bad as they are with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless man, has literally fallen into their boat and they begin their journey to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has stowed away, but despite this, the four men become friends and land on another island. It looks like paradise and they are all very happy. A little later, a beautiful young lady comes to them, and everything looks great. Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place is flooded with riffs. Eventually the mob decides to hang the four men and take over - at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared. <br /> <br /> I want to give the movie some credit to be original and interesting. But one thing is not FUNNY - and it is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy flick. Although it's not a bad movie, it's definitely not a good one. A sad end to their brilliant career. <br /> <br /> All the actors, except the duo, are dubbed English when the film was made in France. Although it may not be the very best movie they made (this would be the big noise), it's probably close! Watching this movie is painful and like watching people clean up after a serious accident.
