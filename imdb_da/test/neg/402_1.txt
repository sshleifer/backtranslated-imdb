I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie someday, but one was simply horrible. The actor (?) Was horrible almost to the point that I completely smashed the movie. I thought I always saw the worst, but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! Honestly - that was the play that made this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I found the actor to be clumsy and the lead man / woman was extremely boring. This movie had absolutely nothing for it. I can ask a ridiculous question here, but why nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think no one would see if they left them? I think they were probably right! Oh where are Price and The Tingler when you need them?
