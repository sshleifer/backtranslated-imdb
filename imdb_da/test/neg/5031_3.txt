I didn't make any big assumptions that this was certainly a very, very free fit from Eça de Queiroz's work, and I have to say that this free adaptation is the book as many good ideas and signs. The problem is the way that is done, without care, without taste, just a shake of bad taste clusters everywhere. The manuscript is so fake and the characters so unreal that it makes petty to see good actors like Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others, lost themselves in a network of anything except cinema or storytelling. To my surprise, beginners Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves are poor in their performances, but you can see them lost as a driven boat without any direction. And talking about direction, this seems to be something totally missing on this movie ?? where is the director? Everything is bad taste; The frames are no matter, and when there is no use of a handheld camera for no reason, the lighting design, which must build environments, should not exist (and no excuses that all point is a dark reality story). The problem generally in this "trying to be" movie is it's like no taste or very, very bad taste. It is sad to see Jorge and Soraia melt away in such fake and tip six scenes, painted here and there through the film as closing narratives holes or used as false transition motives. Perhaps Carlos Coelho da Silva would see the Carlos Carrera 2002 adaptation of the same book Eça and get the felling of how to build a real movie.
