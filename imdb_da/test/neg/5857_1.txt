I watched this movie last night, a satire of the reality-style programs that seem to be doing the rounds at the moment. <br /> <br /> What can I say. I completely hated it. About as interesting as seeing paint dry and with maybe one or two little entertaining moments. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it had something to do with me, definitely not a fan of Survivor and Big Brother type shows, but if this had been a video / DVD or if I had watched the movie alone, I definitely don't have more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
