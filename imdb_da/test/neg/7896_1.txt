The movie starts relatively well and seems to have come somewhere when an African American passenger sues an airline for negligence. There's a scene where his dog dog is sucked into the engine and that's really a sad thing. But the way it is portrayed makes it hard for one to find out if it was an attempt at raw humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence? After this point, they clearly ran out of ideas. If you are stuck long enough, you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made. It is basically a very racist sequence of smoking clogs, toilet humor, styling of every segment of the plane that reflects African-American pop culture and virtually nothing else. You think the only 3 white passengers on board would lead to some hilarious consequences, but none of the same happens. They were basically just added to show how badly they were initially treated and later accepted in the hood if they appeared. Avoid.
