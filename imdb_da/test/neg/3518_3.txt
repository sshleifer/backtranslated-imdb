Hungary can't make any good movies. Fact. This is a good example of that. <br /> <br /> First of all, the concept of "plot" does not exist in this movie. It is seriously weak. Although many people would argue for it. Sure, it's about a taboo, but it's about it. There are endless possibilities that could have been really good if they were used, but they almost ran everywhere. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures that are the only decent things in this whole heap of horror. The play is simply sloppy. There aren't many lines, so you think the actors have great facial expressions or mimic abilities, but no. In fact, they suck 86% of the time. And that's when they don't say anything. If they even say a single word, you will start to tilt your head and say, "It is damn unrealistic". But once again this is partly the fault of the writing. There are also no emotions in most dialogues. Editing is sometimes ok, but most of the time is illogical and aggravates the whole picture. It could have given an emotional push, but it seems that the editing here is about putting down cuts one after the other. <br /> <br /> Someone you can explain to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. Calling this an "art" will not do better. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Live with it. Although you probably don't care about my or any other guys mind that scares your "child".
