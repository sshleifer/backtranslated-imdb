I own this movie. And it's terribly hard to find. It is a unique low budget little goreflick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion. It has the really humorous low budget and it is surprisingly good for what seems to be a budget of $ 500. I wouldn't go that far, but maybe in his time he was. Overall 6/10 on the gore chart.
