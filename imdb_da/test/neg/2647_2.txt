Back in the dark days of 1990, the hoped shepherds of the Spielberg throne (after the mistake of supposed whiz-kid Phil Joanou) were mistakenly believed to be pretentious Spielberg wannabe David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to fly the studios to over a million dollars and sucked baby boomers to believe in his manuscript - a combination of nostalgic, 1960's references and a disturbing drama on child abuse - somehow matched good storytelling and a decent movie . <br /> <br /> Once Rod Stewart sang, "See how wrong you can be." <br /> <br /> But the beginner's artsy-fartsy, "ET"-inspired script convinced enough people that he was the next selected - the new spielberg - and then an agreement was reached not only to buy the manuscript for more Money than 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lifetime, but for Evans to lead the movie too - though he had never done anything in his life. <br /> <br /> How hard can it be to be another movie-making genius? Despite two weeks in the slider, Columbia found out. His daily newspapers were called "completely useless" by the studio - or at least they were largely insufficient to fall under E.N.C. (Emperor's new clothes) spell. All his recordings were scrapped and reused for guitar images. So what is a studio to do after lowering $ 10 or $ 20 million for something they still believed represented the resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Rent Spielberg yourself to save the day? Columbia probably tried it. <br /> <br /> Enter old pro Richard Donner. Hi, he must not be a cinematic genius, but he gets the job done. "Superman" was not that bad - and the first "Lethal Weapon" was quite good. So Donner enters and grabs the direct clothes. Fortunately, he manages to convince Columbia that the worst of the movie's eerie fantasy sequences - which would have played as a ten-year-old acid-ride - must go. Unfortunately, he leaves in the Crying Buffalo (ooh, how poetic) and the ridiculous, pseudo-Spielberg-fantasy end, complete with Clueless Mom, completely content for the rest of her life to get postcards from his missing son, which he circles about the globe in his red cart. Right. <br /> <br /> However, Donner managed to get a decent performance out of Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco as the idiotmother was also not bad. Perhaps Donner should be re-evaluated. Perhaps he is not such a fake Hollywood hack that everyone has always believed. The only reason I give this overcrowded misfire a 2 rating is that someone was smart enough to throw the big John Heard (but in the wrong part, of course). The kids do okay, though Tom Hanks' horrible, all-explanatory story almost destroys any scene it needs. <br /> <br /> One might think that after David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys from the world, the studios can finally appear. One might hope that these hype-driven film-making debacles might prevent Emperor's New Clothes syndrome from rearing his ugly head again. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
