So many have detailed here with a degree of seriousness that I find entertaining, this is * not *: <br /> <br /> A movie. (cue dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's just such a bad-it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan stunt-for-all. The women's warriors are quite kick-butt and Jackie is definitely in his place. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by munchies, ready to roar with laughter, cheer on the good guys, boo the evil ones and continue to cry , "WHAT?" when something quite bizarre happens. Fun !!
