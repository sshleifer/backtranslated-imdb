I don't honestly know what legal or illegal substance they - the authors - were on when they wrote this horrible piece! <br /> <br /> The noise - sucking The reason - sucking Editing - sucking The whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers comes across a lesbian vampire morality, you just have to be completely out of your mind to see yet 1 minute of this. The only reason I had to see it - it was here! network as part of a two-ticket purchase and the movie that came after it was the right one I wanted to see. I quickly jumped all over and was just amazed at how stupid this movie was at double speed! <br /> <br /> Don't rent, buy or watch this movie .... the vampires in the movie don't suck as much as the overall movie and production does! <br /> <br /> If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon & Katharine Deneuve - great movie to see / own / rent in place of this piece of pure sh * t
