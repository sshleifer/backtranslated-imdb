I thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it. The premise was too stupid and predictable. I didn't make it into the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She is of course older than cabbie (unless she is much younger than she looks). He is black and she is white. She makes more money than him (he's just a cabbie). It is 3 of the society's most statistically unsuccessful unions, all rolled into one, and we must pretend to have a chance in hell. She would be better off marrying the guy she doesn't love. <br /> <br /> I only saw it in part because I love MJW as an actor. His performance was amazing. Hers, meh! It was OK, but the premise is too stupid. Don't see the end. Couldn't do it there, so I don't know if it ended differently from the way I had predicted the ending would be. I can't imagine any black woman who likes this movie. There is something boring about seeing a black man providing a white woman. And an old one on it. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
