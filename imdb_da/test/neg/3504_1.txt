I wrote this as a two-part review. Part two has spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, it's not about sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know who everyone is racist, and race is always the theme of everyone's mind. Race. <br /> <br /> It's like the movie has some kind of tower syndrome, where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a film that took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the interruption of people tangentially connected and then turned it into a 1'53 "mental vomiting about racism in America RACE During the 24-hour period, we have 7 stories that run in parallel all coherent and about race.The first hour people say ridiculous things and do absurd things in an attempt to be genuine about racism in America. For example, the story of Ludicrous and Larenz Tate gives the comic relief, and the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction RACISM Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section, where, Instead To be cool and talk about foot massage and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANT. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about it is Mexican history when the Mexican guy talks to his daughter. her invisible impenetrable robe to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the authors have had daughters and know what they would say in his place. The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi is not in any kind of realism. The scene in which he tries to get the lock fixed and Mexican tells him he needs a new door is shortened and stupid. Why would anyone act like this? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me of more of convenience stores clerk from The Doom Generation. "Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents Girly." If I ever see the other half of the movie, I hope the head is shot off and his bodily head starts coughing up. I haven't mentioned race in over a section. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then there is the black guy who will be white, Matt Dillon, who has a chip on his shoulder against black, Ryan Phillippe, who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors who seem bad with poor dialogue. When Matt Dillon supports the black producer's wife, could I help if I broke up? When Philippe second guesses to write his partner for racism, can I help jump up? The movie is so fun when it is racist. Racist. RACIST I'll tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Instructor, Best Manuscript and Best Editing, in addition to a nod to Matt Dillon who actually tried to do a decent job. Who was paid for one, I have no idea. Don't see it unless you want to be taught about racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no kind of reality or interaction with real society in any form or form. <br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes all the stories in the first half ... and spits them back in some kind of redemptive The conclusion is that the world is a great coincidence in a way. And it's actually one of the worst ways to do it. <br /> <br /> Take the 1999 Magnolia. People were not conveniently tied together again and again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something that you knew others were involved in too. Crash takes this pack into a serious extreme. The stories are lined up so all meet again. Is there only 5 on the LAPD force? Do these people not work oddly? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And why should Tate be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional excitement as well as realism if it had been someone we hadn't followed all day long? Just like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everyone would be freaking out. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the second half, the touching invisible robe scene is used to get Hindi to shoot the daughter. It crossed me and got me dirty. Not that the Hindu shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then it had the direct cause of people tearing up. It really crossed me. At the authors, not the stage. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and totally unconditional. The coincidences are far too many, and they require an extreme suspension of unbelievers. In contrast to Magnolia, which was linked mildly, it had compounds on compounds on compounds that were just as over-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. She doesn't die. She should have. I cheered when she fell. <br /> <br /> The worst part about the movie is that it draws a Magnolia. Not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see that everyone is depressed. Magnolia took this and had postmodern comments on it by having all the characters singing together to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. It's hard to comment on a movie that won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. In some way. <br /> <br /> Spoken waste of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: lowest class ever; Overall: F ---
