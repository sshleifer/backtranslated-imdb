I just watched Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste. "You could be with Herbie: Fully loaded," he said with a sly smile, "but instead you're here to see Seijun Suzuki's princess raccoon." The audience applauded and cheered. Well, let me tell you, I'd rather have seen Herbie: Fully loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, a supposedly spinning musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. It's so miserable that its misery actually makes me unlucky for other Seijun Suzuki movies, which is quite an experience. There is so much expansion of things that are wrong with Princess Raccoon that I hardly know where to start. Perhaps its worst mistake is both aggressively incomprehensible and mind bogglingly monotonous. If the wheels were mixed together, or if half were lost in the shipment, the audience would not know the difference. If you don't believe in me, I dare you to steal a push and get someone to run the wheels in random order. If you can tell me which one goes where I will give you every penny I have. <br /> <br /> The first third of the movie has a mishmash of scenes, songs (including a cringe-inducing rap number) and pictures it doesn't seem to be related in any way at all. Horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain, adding another wall to the huge, and rapidly growing, wall of incomprehensibility. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the author wrote down any Japanese folklore that came to mind a bunch of note cards, stacked them up, mixed them, took the cards out of a table, and then wrote the manuscript according to their order. <br /> <br /> About thirty-five minutes in the movie, part of a plot comes on stage. Something about a form-changing raccoon princess (in human form) and an ordinary person who falls in love. I hoped that this was a movie of the movie as something other than a series of confusing scenes, but not such luck. The movie continues in the same absolutely enchanting way. I wish I had come out then, but I was caught in the middle of a narrow row. In retrospect, it would have been worth the awkward scene. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted, just thinking about the last few wheels. I spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. Every big dolly moves, swells in music or scene, so distant as if it were conclusions that renewed my hope that the credits were rolling. For agonizing the minute after the agonizing minute, it went on. And about and over and over. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to what I was sure to be an abstract pattern over which credits were being shown. Then cut it to another scene, for whatever reason. How could I forget it? The completely independent subplot of a ninja caught, urinated on and cooked in a soup was not yet packed. <br /> <br /> I'll never get them back 111 minutes, but you can save yourself the pain. Unless you want to sense your memory or future enjoyment of great Seijun Suzuki movies like the Kid of the Beast and the Tokyo Drifter, you can't see Princess Raccoon. I'd rather have used my time for vomiting.
