I would have given this less than a 1 rating if possible. The whole movie should have been left on the floor. What a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... gather the most beautiful cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack) ... throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up ... and the viola! An eerie piece of garbage that the director and / or the producer was ashamed to put their name on. How Much WORSE can horror genre get? And don't use a "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many big low budget movies .... in fact, some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget. If you don't have the talent and the ingenuity to make a good scary movie, don't do it for God's sake !!!
