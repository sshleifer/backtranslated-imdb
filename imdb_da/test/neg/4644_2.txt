It is a truism that requires a lot of effort to make a bad movie - this is no exception. I am not a lover of yanks, but their astonishingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as low events (even fictitious in novels) fit into an agenda that carries little or no relation to any kind of complexity , is annoying at the extreme. <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptive verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than what has been provided by this horrible mishmash of a movie. <br /> <br /> Really sad for those who never want to read Smith. They will be left with a less than decent depiction of his Egyptian series that may be said to be gigantic in his exhibition. The Indiana Jones movies were snappy. Trying to replicate it by manipulating Smith's novels into this production misses a country mile. <br /> <br /> Pathetic except photography and Art Malik.
