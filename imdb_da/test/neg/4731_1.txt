If you like me, you can enjoy movies with plots and convincing actors, so Alien V's Predator Requiem is probably not the way to go. In summary, foreign countries in the typical American city, Predator landing in the American city, both have a bit of struggle, the US government blows the city, some people come away ..... I'm sorry, I think, I could have spoiled the ending. It is easy to criticize anyone who is critical; People cry out, I bet you couldn't do anything better! I testify I could! After making this film, it looked and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a well done work; There must surely have been the ghost of lunacy in the room.
