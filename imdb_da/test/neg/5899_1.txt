I was so disappointed with this movie. The roofline was something like "The story of a girls sexual awakening". You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen at the time, and I took my girlfriend to see it. I thought we should see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend gagging for it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I suppose we just weren't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we didn't just have at that time. I'm not sure I have it now, and I've long ago divorced the company with that girlfriend (pity really ... my first love). We left the cinema halfway through the movie, my friend, who should have known better, remained for the whole thing. I still got the desired result with my girlfriend, the film didn't help much. It would be interesting to see it again so that I can make a more informed criticism, even though I feel that the experience has left me frightened for life.
