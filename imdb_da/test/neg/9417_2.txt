Solo is a bad movie - that can't be ignored. The action is mostly wood (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solos creates Bill), and the story is small enough that you will probably forget it, WHY you where you watch the movie. That said, such films are more about the action than the plot / action, and as such live or die at the action-putting pieces - which is the meaning of such films - giving 14-year-olds something to smile on the adults film of the actual fabric. And even on this Solo fails to deliver - which little action is, is poorly finished, boring and uninspired. After watching the trailer for this on television, I was hoping for something like Predator with a robot that replaced Predaot. Instead, I got a rather lifeless action movie with a poorly designed depth-of-field attempt by noting that robots can also feel. Watch Terminator II or Predator instead .. both classics that this movie desperately wants to be, except it lacks inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.
