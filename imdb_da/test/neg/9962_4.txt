George Zucco, like Boris Karloff, no matter how bad the movie he appeared in was, he would always maintain a dignity and create a good performance. "The Mad Monster" is no exception to this rule. It is by all standards a bad (if entertaining) movie. Of course, the filmmakers did not know how to get the most out of their low budget, and the script seems like it turned out in one or two days. Still, Zucco is fine and credible as the mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is fun at a rental level. Normal horror movie fans will mostly not like PRC movies. But these "Poverty Row" productions have a small but loyal cult following. Occasionally, they would rise above their limitations with "detour" as the best example of this. They usually looked like this. For all its technically poor qualities, "The Mad Monster" is an entertaining enough way to kill a rainy afternoon. DVD from Retromedia is recommended as it mates with another PRC production "The Black Raven", the original theater film, and best of all an interview with Glenn Strange, who talks about his role in this movie. (4/10)
