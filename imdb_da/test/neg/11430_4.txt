Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting follow-up hits the screen as three short stories in Edinburgh, all with a couple of Welsh brands, drug culture, depression, the working class, and the Hibernian football club. Uncomfortable to look at places it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories have a dark comic twist to them, while the 2nd story is a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot for it. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will undoubtedly adopt a cult follow.
