This is a really horrible movie. The witnesses are few and far between, and pacing is a down right endurance test. The only fun thing to get out of this production is that it is a comparison with the classic movie "This Is Spinal Tap." <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if it were one of the battles of the Bible itself. /> <br />
