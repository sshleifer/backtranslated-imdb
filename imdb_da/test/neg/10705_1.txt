The plot - in the future, when almost all men have been killed by a Y chromosome target virus, creates a (hot) female genetic engineer 'a man in a chemistry lab - is exciting. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the film becomes flat in almost every respect. The dialogue is ridiculous. The characters are paper thin. The study of a single-gender world is low. The worst part of the whole movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and constructed that you want to throw up. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how in the ground this waste was produced. Most of the movie is male bashing. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are only animals." All the women - even the "cabinet erero cases" - seem to show anger, fear and hatred for men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie somewhat in line with this movie's premise, you will do the best for you to look elsewhere.
