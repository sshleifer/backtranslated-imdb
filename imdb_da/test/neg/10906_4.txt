Cookie cutter is going to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The reason, as it is, has been done before trillion times, so there is no need to tell any of it. Suffice it to say that all 12-year-old girls will love this movie, while the rest of us are forced to make a face. Even the soundtrack is terrible! It's not that I don't like skating, even though I'm not doing it, I don't like clich√©, bad movies.
