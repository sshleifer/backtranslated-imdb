When I made this movie in my DVD player and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this movie would include some of the strong points of the first movie: Awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, fun comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. But to my disappointment, none of this is found in Atlantis: Milo's Return. Had I read some reviews first, I may not have been so disappointed. The following paragraphs will be directed to those who have seen the first movie and who have had it primarily for those points. <br /> <br /> When the first scene appears, you're in shock if you've just chosen Atlantis: Milos Return from the display of your local video shop (or anything) and had the expectations I had . The music feels like a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by one not so appropriate. (Except for a few characters, like Sweet's voice). The actual drawings are not that bad, but the animation is especially a sad sight. The story is also quite weak as it is more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the only adventurous story we got last time. But don't get me wrong, it's not very good Schooby-Doo episodes. I didn't even laugh, though I might have sneaked once or twice. <br /> <br /> For audiences who have not seen the first movie or not particularly care for a similar sequel, here is a quick review of this movie as a standalone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you can like this movie. If you didn't, you can still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suppose it might be a good kids movie, but I wouldn't know. It might have been better if Milo's Return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel or on breakfast TV.
