If I had only read the review by Alex Sander (sic) here instead of looking at the review of over 6 from a selection of the ignorant view policy, I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well-made horror / sci-fi. The predator was a great sci-fi / action mess-about. I really only blame myself, even though I saw 'Alien versus Predator'. It also has an average rating of over 6 stars from the film experts who frequent this site. <br /> <br /> Stop reading now if you have any problems with this so the sussepency RIDDEN PLOT is being cleaned for you. /> From the beginning, this movie was ridiculous. No explanation was offered to the Predator ship being exceeded / not exceeded by foreigners. OK then maybe they would throw foreigners back to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong, but how did it result in an Alien / Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realize despite their good technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the movie because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what was what and maybe why. From then on, it will be really ridiculous. I always leave my unbeliever strictly suspended over the screen door before I go in and collect it on the way out. I couldn't go here. <br /> <br /> A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash landed (from the point of view) I would calculate at least 10 odd miles away through thick forest. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get the face curled. Even at this time, you feel very little to them, mainly because the face-hugging is almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions, and the father seems like such an irresponsible, stupid redneck muppet. An edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the city near the crash site to be met by his little numb, boring now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced, I mean a weak attempt at crap actors, and no feeling is the game. A slasher / horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposed nerdy or somehow unwanted sweet guy being scolded by the overprotective, crazy, ugly Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the sweet / not sweet boy is the parent's brother by the way. Yes, they are wise these directors whose name I want to investigate to avoid any other shame they put out again. Then a modern role reverse oh so boring attempt on PC, Ripley's credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child. Guess what happens next? I don't want to tell you much more about the actual (sadly, about herself about the loss of stories in the vast majority of recent movies), plot only if you have this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien riddle the universe. The predator is stupid for the reasons given by the previous poster whose post I was reading too late. Foreigners are boring. Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is sometimes useful, free, scary nonsense. The hospital with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh I was shocked okay. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shocks? Telling it perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titrate and frighten people who are not pregnant or expect fathers or do not have souls, why not just Alien / Predator shagging the naughty women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth nor the plot. It's filmed and paced badly. It is traded by uninterested people, not that I can blame them. It adds another two quite interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This movie was bad and if you enjoy it, I really need to worry about you. If you haven't seen it so well, please make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS Have I even mentioned the way in which trained soldiers are all killed for about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive all the time?
