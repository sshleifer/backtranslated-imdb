Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax that stops letting the door open for some 2. Let's hope someone has meaning to spend their money smarter. I would suggest a 'Charmed - movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' kicked ass and I only saw the show to please my boyfriend !!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. Or even better download it so you don't waste your money. The first 15 minutes were okay. But the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says, "Kiss my ass Harry Potter" while driving on a rock. Although they are not worthy to kiss Potter's ass because Potter is far cooler and at least his movie has a story. Goblet of fire was even frightening than this !!!
