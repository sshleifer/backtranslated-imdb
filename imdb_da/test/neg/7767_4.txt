I don't expect much from the movie, so it's not so disappointed. Carrie so nasty, Mr. Big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha didn't say ***. Charlotte's child was annoying to see when she was in too many scenes - the title could easily have been "SATC: Parents Night Out." Camera angles were just not as good, especially with regard to Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a token black woman thrown in whose character has no proper exit and too few appearances of gay men's friends who seemed to be thrown in with no purpose anyway. Samantha goes back and forth from LA strangled the story flow, especially when she enters Fashion Week and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have been made in the rush because it could have been good, but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or offer viewers a chance to jump back into the show without adding much to the story of the movie.
