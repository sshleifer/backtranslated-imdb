There should be some kind of prosecution to punish the producers from funding screenplays this stupid. I feel that some kind of criminalization of bad movies might prevent more movies that this idiotic is made. Sure it has an interesting cast of characters, but I don't think I've ever seen a more carton performance from a whole cast as in this unique crappy piece of crap. That director should somehow be punished for not producing at least some kind of performance out of these people. So detachment is a theme (not really, they beat you over with this one), that doesn't mean that every character should recite their lines as if they were on the NPR. Did I mention this movie was crappy? Finally, I'm not sure which compound a mouth will have with terminal bone cancer, but I'm pretty sure if you were completely brain dead, your cancer would continue to grow regardless. This film is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals, and non-retarded people. Oh, and finally, hops fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by beating their wings like any other flying insect. I totally despise people who present false knowledge as fact. Next time do a little research before using a carefree misconception as a prerequisite for a whole freaking movie. I just think you're in JESUS!
