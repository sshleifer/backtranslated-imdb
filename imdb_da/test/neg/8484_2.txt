SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I've seen many movies. I didn't think I'd ever see a movie that I actually hated. The mask's son destroyed it. The son of the mask is so bad that I won't even make a detailed comment as I usually do. In fact, I won't even write much. I think all of you should know that this movie is terribly horrible. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was great in Scream, but now this movie! Also this movie takes a SMO-CAN movie and turns it into this greasy kids movie that will not even suffer children. This film also consists of very rude humor. Like nasal woman. She has a nose to her head and when she sneezes, white stuff jumps out of her nose. There is also an exorcist parody. Yes, a kid movie has an adult parody. Maybe they thought the adults wanted it. Frankly, it made the movie even more cheesier and raw. <br /> <br /> Here's the basic, stupid plot. Tim Avery dog ​​gets the amazing Loki mask and becomes a cartoon dog thing. When Tim pays more attention to the child with special powers, comic dog becomes a Wiley Coyote ripoff. Then Loki takes the child with great powers, and Tim and Loki have a really cheesy animated fight. Tim has the mask. It all ends well. Too bad this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the original Mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey movie. This is basically not. Please, please do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake by renting this. I don't want you to make the same exact mistake. I feel terrible that I couldn't write a detailed comment, but really, what is there to comment on? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I'd give it one, but come on, it's basically a kid movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: The Mask.
