As a flying and war filmmaker, this ranks at the bottom of my list. It is historically completely inaccurate, and the sound sounds and seems like they just went out of a high school game. Plays, scripts, direction, production standards and casting are all trash cans. The only saving grace is some of the flying sequences. If the people they portray were fictitious, I can judge it a 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in film, it pretends to be history and that the great people they are trying to be actually doing this! It's almost as if they were trying to write in as many remarkable WW1 personalities as possible. There are many good WW1 flying movies, and it's not one of them.
