Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ??? Maybe it was an outbreak of temporary mental deterioration? But I guess that because I kind of enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but fun scare comedy that had some okay effects of Screaming Mad George. It and the fact that on the successor of the successor there was a lovely picture of this guy who was impaled by this gigantic fire cake (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and everything). So I thought: if it is as idiotic as the first and has something nice splatter / gore in it, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead wrong! <br /> <br /> Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an enormously crazy and retarded plot. I mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that jumps mutant killers baby snowballs that can only be killed or damaged by bananas ??? As much as I love the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST resembled a real movie (apparently shot on real movies and all), this sequels the appearance of a third-rate soap opera. In this way, it also has a smooth shot on video look. The lighting is simply awful (bright white spots for today's look and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The play ... Now it doesn't even go. The dialogues range from rigid to extremely senile (the Jamaican man was just moronic and said "man" after each sentence). And when it comes to the killer's snake's voice, I could only think that it was a seventh movement of Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY, spitting stupid and apparently witty one-liners before killing anyone. <br /> <br /> The best joke was where a guy asks "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with the beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool completely naked (thank you for that!). Oh yeah, and the little scene of the final credits with the two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship that was badly doubled had me laughing too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the acting and splatter action that everyone is talking about? There were plenty of apartments to show some decent gory kills. Many people were killed in original ways here, but all off-screen. As I have read in many other comments, there were really good setups for a main explosion, a broken body, the eyes were knocked out, the tongue torn out ... but at the crucial moments the editor cuts off to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all . The frontal shot of the British guy was printed (from the back of the DVD) was not even in the movie. I only saw the special killing filmed from the back (which means I couldn't see!)! I waited throughout the movie for it to happen, and then I see nothing?!?! What a let-down! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? It would be a shame because only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killed snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just doesn't cut it for me. Talking about these snowballs: they were done very badly. The created MUNCHIES are similar to state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. But I think that was the whole point. At one point, the special effects of the crew turned to some ridiculously bad CGI. Boy, you really need to see it to believe it. The best thing is not to see it, in fact, for this flick is just too bad (okay, I laughed at it because it got worse and worse). Just stick to the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be okay (just thinking that it's a rather stupid horror comedy, but fun in itself). <br /> <br /> It's fun, but author / director Michael Cooney may have somehow realized that he was a pretty bad instructor after JACK FROST 2, and then focused on writing. Turns out he wrote two really good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So the man seems to have some talent. <br /> <br /> It would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible. So I say one point that the naked Asian child is doing the skinny dipping and a point for the completely delayed snowballs. Way to go. Cooney!
