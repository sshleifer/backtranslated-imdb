I just looked at this "latest" version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised by the solid play and the obvious effort that would turn a low budget historical piece into a full-fledged movie. A note though, the music was very paralyzed and added nothing to the film's intensity and sounded like a person with a keyboard and a lot of samplers as opposed to a full orchestra score. I think Paul Farrer should get his act together !!!
