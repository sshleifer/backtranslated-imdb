Clearly tailored vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It appears that the studios hoped that he could play a leading hard policeman and did not look like he was forever 16. He can't .. Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as bookends to Phillippe but when they are not screen Phillippe flounders; his superficial acting has nothing to jump out of. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical late 20-year-old potboiler good policeman / poor politician with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of the 1970s television series, such as "The Streets of San Francisco." Snipes represents his role as the eternal black-skin cork, and plays a slightly less madman than his demolition role. However, there was not much for Snipes and Statham to chew on. Statham's character announces that he had given up nicotine and caffeine - something this film needed much for injections of. <br /> <br /> Really forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe explains in Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Covers: No. It's just something I picked up along the way.
