Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's worst movie he has ever made. It is filled with its usual ingredient, that is, snappy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feels deja-vu. The management is typically Tarantino and nothing seems brand new. It's almost like he's copied right from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that isn't fun or brilliant as Pulp Fiction was. Basterds allegedly is Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti Western, but seems to be confused and out of place, especially with the continued use of large subtitles and throwing the balance.
