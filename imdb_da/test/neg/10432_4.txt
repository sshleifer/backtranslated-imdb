I saw this on a screener DVD a few months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the overall story, but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The seats were adequate, but a couple just looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. Absolutely not what the DVD cover claims, "Hardly the next stoner classic". <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and hairstyles are well done and yes, there are some really beautiful girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene contained guitar that just drank again and again. Sound design was a bit poor. I think less would have been the best.
