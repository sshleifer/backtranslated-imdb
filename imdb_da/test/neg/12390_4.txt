The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure which door in the movie should not have been opened. <br /> <br /> The film uneventfully starts with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room similar to a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, man's house is a train car and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she has been told that her grandmother is ill, and she must return to her hometown. She hasn't been there for thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Flash back to thirteen years ago. A shady figure goes into a house. He caresses a sleeping young girl, then enters another room and sticks the girl's mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her. She screams and an arm comes out of nothing and claps a hand over her mouth. She looks up in fear. The early stage in the movie of the murderer muffling her screams, and the girl's appearance is one of the few effective shots in the movie. It doesn't have much to do for it in the visual department. Occasionally there is a strange sound use, and there is some strange light on a ceiling scene, where many of the glass panes are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Back to the present. The young woman comes in her grandmother's house. An old doctor is there whom she does not trust, along with the man from the opening scene "Judge" and Kearn, the city's museum operator. She does not trust any of them, and it is true that they do not inspire any trust. She's pretty crabby in the whole movie. She wants to check out her grandmother in a hospital. The men in town want their house, and the museum's operator wants things in it (his museum is already filled with many of the grandmother's things). Inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman begins to receive phone calls from a man talking in an unlucky whisper. He does various threats and wants her to do things to wake him up. Such scenes are often repeated. Unfortunately, there are so few signs in the film that the possibilities for who it might be are limited. Even worse, from the start we see who is calling. So even though the young woman does not know (although the caller occasionally falls into her normal voice), the audience always knows: no excitement. Every call reveals her more and more. <br /> <br /> The end was unexpected for me, so maybe get points not to go with the obvious, but I'm not sure I took care of it.
