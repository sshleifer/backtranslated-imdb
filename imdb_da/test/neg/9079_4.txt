"The evil that men do" begins with a truly repulsive torture scene, followed later by graphic verbal descriptions of as repellent torture methods as the sadistic, heartless villain likes to use. However, despite the use of such severe-for-shock effects, the filmmakers cannot really cover the fact that this is only a boring, low-lying Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better script.
