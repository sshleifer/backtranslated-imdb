I've seen three other movies that are worse than this, "Plan 9 from Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project" There are so many technical flaws in this movie that, regardless of a decent plot movie is just not credible. Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between cars. The killer walks up behind her victim as she moves from car to car and pushes her out of the train. <br /> <br /> In a scene, a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. He will sneak at the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He shows his stereo! If I heard my stereo suddenly getting higher, I would be concerned. He kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be thrown ten meters and remain connected. Plus the apartment was so modern enough to have ground clearance sales in the bathroom, and the victim was still electrocuted. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the best known commercial aircraft on the planet, so this part really amazed me. First, the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and the other was not on the top deck of the plane. I looked with great amazement when the pilot and the co-pilot (where was the aircraft engineer?) Walked right past the spiral staircase and looked forward to the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also amazed that bullets would not penetrate an aluminum trolley (good thing for our hero) or bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling and cause fuel leakage that came out through a small hole in the hull. Huh? Looking at three guys extending a 100 meter track in less than a week was also quite fantastic. <br /> <br /> I didn't check it was a movie this week or something? It was awful.
