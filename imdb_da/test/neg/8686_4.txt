Max Cash a charter boat captain working off the Caribbean island of San Sebastian is employed by Sarah, looking for legendary boat, El Diablo and his stolen treasure that sank into the reef of the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the ship's whereabouts as people who knew something about it are killed. <br /> <br /> I agree with those who were under the impression that this would be a horror feature. Instead, it was a rental home, b-class late 80's, who started 1977 deep-sea adventure movie 'The Deep', but with an enchanting supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. The story is a rather muddle (so many inconsistent angles do not make sense and encourage a soft pace) and the technical side is lumpy. Nice exotic location and during water photography though. While the carefree performances were not bad either. A grub Wayne Crawford is a pleasant twig and June Chadwick is fair alongside him. Sheri Able is mostly eye-cat. There are some bizarre developments that amuse and one or two spooky sequences. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. Most of the worn-out deaths occur on the screen, with the exception of the bloody, fitful opening killing done by something unseen. Again, it's just another thing that leaves you high and dry. The music is generic with its pounding signals to warn us of approaching danger and the POV shots get a good workout. Tatty, but watchable.
