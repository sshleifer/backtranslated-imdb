Jason Lee does well to give this dog movie a fleeting promise, but it is not enough to distinguish it from any other gentle family comedy. This live-action, CG-enhanced adventure sees a spoiled police dog (Jason Lee) transformed into a super-dog through an accident in the lab of the scheming scientist Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog sets out to save the city as he tries to keep his identity secret - a challenge as he can both talk and fly. The odd gag raises a smile, but Underdog's human sidekicks (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are just as boring as the predictable story. One for kids for young people to have seen Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog ??
