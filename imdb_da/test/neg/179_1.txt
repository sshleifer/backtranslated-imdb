Has Beavis and Butthead made this movie? It's just so bad. Really a bumpy and unfair depiction of "bad" vs "good" in the wine world. Have you noticed the filmmaker who is trying one of the wines from the featured patrons of individual wines and terroir. The camera's work is staggering at best, while the content can put you in bed before long. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this movie was that the filmmaker tried hard to make a point about winter's globalism by showing that the Mondavi family owned vineyards in all parts of the world. Okay it's a good start. So how do these wines compare? Have the Mondavi Napa cabin taste like their Italian wines. We never find out because no one in the film commented on this. Instead, there is much insinuation about Nazis and fascism. Well, these things don't grow grapes. Hmmmm.
