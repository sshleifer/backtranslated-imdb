It was the first action movie made in the banned in the USSR Hollywood action style. It's not even close to Hollywood action movies of that time. The foundation is childish, the management is so-so. This movie succeeded because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Although I saw it many times, I have to admit that it was kind of naive and I didn't like it. This is not the best example of Russian action film. This is just the first experience.
