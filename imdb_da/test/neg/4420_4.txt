The width and height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me. About a week ago I wrote a comment on 1926 quiet epic MACISTE IN HELL that referred to it as "staggering". Then I encountered the Pollonia Bros BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ... It's about the scale of the thinking behind it. Pollonia Bros and colleague John McBride thought so great that the muscles of Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY are fortunate, it was released fifty-two years before this treasure. In fact, Kubrick made it easy with modeling, a budget, actual actors, and major student grants for his little "Star Trek" ripoff, and all that Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the horrible thing. What is so difficult about muscles around a typewriter? The Pollonia brothers, on the other hand, had thought radically outside the box and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including a hot lookin chick - bought a bunch of colored light bulbs, raided old office volumes for each keyboard, screen and hands-free phone headset, got all identical black turtlenecks made with each cupcake tin in the county, learned enough 3d modeling and texture skins to animate a few spaceship fly-bys, spent a few hours drum a script, executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since the horrible little monster, Jabba Hut One who was carried around with him was fried by R2D2, spent literally days with a VHS camera and an Amiga shooting and editing their movies and coming up winners. This is the best D.I.Y. direct to the home video fan movie space epic i have ever seen, and in terms of the amount of talent and resources available to the filmmakers dwarfs even LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as being a chilling look at our future, right down to a news machine carrying a mis-matched, poorly-fitting 2nd handbag. As a species we are doomed. But in a moment it's a big improvement on such later epics as DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: Alien PREDATORS, which is fun since it was made before either of these masterpieces. Somewhere along the lines, Pollonia began to take it easy on herself: This film is performed with a certain belief that makes you believe that you can really breathe in a vacuum with a dust mask and two biker syringes. And the scene where alien animals use a miniaturized crew member immediately alerted me to where I had seen it before: GODZILLA VS. Sea Monster, where the giant rampaging monster crabs point two canoes and eat them on camera. It made me cry when I was a kid. This made me cry as an adult because I'm wasting my time trying to be a kind of critic or writer or writer / critic and these guys come to Have fun that actually makes a true feature-length sci-fi epic with lots of cool colored lights, a warm chick and a talking light projector named KAL. One of the flight crews even gets to carry his black room baseball cap backwards and glows with his goatee like that clown from Metallica. Should it be a joke? No. It is an epic statement of mankind, of humanity and of humanity that deserves to be seen by someone who has the ability not to take any of it too seriously. Look for it on a 2-drawer set called GALAXY OF TERROR in your favorite discount dealer's cut-out DVD drawers, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "Yes, they have a few sets of our movies for best buy sales. "<br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone lacking in humor might try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But one day, a foreign civilization on the other side of the galaxy will capture a transfer of this movie and decide that we should not actually be messed with. Good work, guys !!
