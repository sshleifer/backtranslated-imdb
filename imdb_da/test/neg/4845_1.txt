I wish I had read more reviews and more opinions on this movie before renting it. Waste of money. A waste of time. Very small dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in every way. The story and plot were both weak. The only thing that was fun was the filmography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time, you will spend so much time trying to figure out things due to lack of dialogue that you will rewind movies a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It was a mess and will make you feel like a mess. <br /> <br /> What would you say when the movie ended?
