I was disappointed with the successor to the Swan Princess. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married the life of Odette and Derek, but the story was not interesting enough to keep my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original. <Br /> <br /> It's not fun. The only bit I found humorous was when Jean-Bob was turned into a prince and then back to a seed and no one saw it happen and he tried to convince them that it really did. <br /> <br /> The villain is bad and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. The queen is a very annoying character and instead of cheering with Derek to save her mother, you hope the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her speech. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I really liked the first movie, but it didn't live up to my expectations.
