Some people thought it was fun because they loved the political issues discussed in this paragraph. However, I am so tired of the state for the two-party system in our country that I cannot mage propaganda from both sides. I was hoping for a horror show but got "cute" zombies and partisan bull crap. I see my horror movies being scared. This didn't even try to be scary. Also this does not have Romero in his political / cultural satire twisted in his film ... it was an obvious, no fantasy story that was difficult for me to belly (for the wrong reasons). On the bright side, if you hate Bush ... you'll love this (I don't pay tribute to Hate or Bush with this statement)
