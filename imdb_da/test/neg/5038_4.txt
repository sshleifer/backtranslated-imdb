Not only is The Great Rock N Roll Swindle thoroughly inaccurate, but when it comes down to it, it is not very interesting whether it is interesting or even entertaining. Malcolm McLaren apparently wasted most of the Sex Pistols' earnings on this waste of film making it so much more unpleasant. The intention was from the beginning to create a monument to "McLaren" genius, which to this day takes full credit to create punk music, create sex guns and sometimes even write all the songs. Viewers follow McLaren with various settings, telling his story to his sidekick, a female dwarf, and just taking credit for one thing after another. A particularly annoying scene has McLaren in an abandoned aircraft hangar waiting for a plane to be beaten by journalists and giving them their "great story". The most entertaining elements of the movie are the animated short pieces, although these rows of McLaren's indulgent self-meaning. Even as a farce, this movie doesn't work. A little about it is entertaining, except Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type of person. Twenty years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the Sex Pistols documentary "The Filth and the Fury". While that movie is much better and more interesting than "Swindle", it is still full of the temple's "artistic blossoms" which just don't seem to interview band members in shade as if they were a kind of crime trying to hide their identity An interesting bit of trivia: Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original screenwriters for the movie "Who Killed Bambi?", Which eventually became "Swindle".
