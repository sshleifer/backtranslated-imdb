You want the worst horror movie in the 21st century? El Chupacabra is. "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is the worst movie of all time, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst movie of this century. It must also distinguish between having the worst worst actor ever. Eric Alegria, the starring actress, has never made another movie than El Chupacabra, gee - I wonder why. The monster apparently attacks humans, but anyone who is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid. And there is no police in this city at all, just two idiot detectives - Hi! Cops show up at the murder scene first, so come the detectives! And apparently, the monster only attacks in a person's backyard and some deserted areas at the quays. Or ... it's the only places the filmmakers can access movies. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is why IMDb should allow us to give negative stars. This deserves worth -10 stars, or at least 0. They must allow a 0 rating.
