When I write this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sweeney Todd story makes great money at the cashier's office, and the film has even earned a few Oscar nominations if I'm not mistaken. I haven't seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton didn't look for inspiration and / or stylish brands in good old Andy Milligy's "Blood-Thirsty Butchers". Yes, although the title clearly mentions butchers, the protagonists of the plot are a barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a female baker. Together they form an eerie alliance, killing customers in their store, and she treats the organs of her famous London meat pies. In other words, an Andy Milligan's premises on his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateurish. I think the IMDb rating for this movie speaks for itself. Although the actual story is certainly not the worst I have ever seen, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts her insecurity. The production is a gigantic mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, really frightening photography, poor lighting, miserable acting and control, ridiculous gore and zilch excitement or atmosphere. More than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how the BORING movie is, even with a run time of just 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; They do not need to fear because no one other than Andy Milligan is ?? hands down ?? The worst instructor ever, but I don't think he cared. Perhaps if you have a really high degree of tolerance, "bloodthirsty butchers" are worth a visit.
