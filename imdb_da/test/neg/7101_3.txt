"Tank Girl" was supposed to be "Buckaroo Banzai" in the 90s and was marketed as such. Admittedly, the comparison is appropriate; Both films have so many things going on in any movie frame that just as impossible as the story has to sort out, it's certainly not boring. "Tank Girl" is a fun enough trip if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise you will end up with a skull-breaking headache like me.
