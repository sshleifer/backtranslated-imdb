I have never seen the original 1930's version of the movie, but this remake is one of the worst I have seen from a major production study this year. Seeing actors like Meg Ryan and Annette Bening when near A-level talents, they sleep through poorly scripted roles, are painful. There seemed to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a trick to appear modern, with an African American lesbian character, but in reality she is there to look just cool. There is no real reason why Brass in this movie except to fill the amount of women in the original I take. The page's characters, played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar, are stereotypical female characters, with Mendes depicting the vixen looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected man and Mazar covering the gossip. The movie is boring, lacks charm, humor or sympathy for any character. It almost felt as if the film was a punishment for everyone involved, either in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope in the movie, but it is a bit legal to shine surrounded by the obscure and dying stars around it is Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still a great talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the movie in the small role she has.
