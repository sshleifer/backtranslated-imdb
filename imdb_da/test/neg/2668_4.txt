By far this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. The action is bad, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was ok, but overall this movie was pretty much a big letdown. Nothing led the story, it lacked substance and the scary ones made Halloween and H20 as good. All of it, skip this movie, it's not worth the price of rental.
