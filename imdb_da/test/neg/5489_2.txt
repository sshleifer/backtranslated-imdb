'Illuminata' has expanded the limits of John Turturro's mediocrity from second-rate actor to third-rate director, author and producer. This movie was horrible. It is incoherent and flashes from scene to scene with little power or meaning relevant to the main story. <br /> <br /> We are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes, each one non-sequitur to all the others. The only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theater repair company. The few scenes that matter to the plot are so terrible that you often can't see if the dialogue is from the story or that the actors are running their lines for the game in history. <br /> <br /> If this story was a person, it would be a schizophrenic with multiple personality disorder. It couldn't determine whether it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sex farce or a parody of the theater. It was almost tolerable as a sex farce. <br /> <br /> Turturro was lifeless and creepy like Tuccio, apparently a complex and passionate writer whose game gets its big chance when the ongoing show has to be canceled because of the main player's illness. Susan Sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress tries to seduce Tuccio into a role. Unfortunately, she found it necessary to go topless, which only shows that hardware of aging gender symbols is much better back to the imagination. Christoher Walkin gave a great performance as the opity theater critic, making passionate overtures a member of the cast. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had minor roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2. Apart from the Walk's vignette, there really isn't much to recommend it except that the dolls are used in opening and closing credits were phenomenally lively and beautiful. Avoid this movie as the plague it is. <br /> <br />
