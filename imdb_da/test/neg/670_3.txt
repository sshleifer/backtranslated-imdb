In comparison with other "sand and sandal" fare, Egypt leaves much to be desired. The film is very LOSELY based on Mika Waltari's well-researched novel centering on the Egyptian physician Sinhue's fairy tale at Akhnaton Court and his travels throughout Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Due to the moral strings of the time, much of Sinhue's history (which is abundant of romantic and sexual exploitation) remains on the floor of the cutting pool, and instead the audience is treated with rolls and rolls of Victor Mature's timber. Even Gene Tierney ?? a leading lady "staple" of the time ?? can't see or do his best in this flick and gives a pretty somnambulistic performance that can only be justified by the fact that the actress at that time had some serious psychiatric problems. There is a great rhetoric and theological enthusiasm about the idea of ​​monotheism vs. polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton, one is certainly cheering for someone to stave off him and restore the old religion before the other wheel. My advice: buy the book from E-Bay, rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and call it that night!
