This is a dull, inert, self-meaning drilling. When the only thing that suddenly gives a movie life is a hanging, you know that the venture is bent. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, tic-ridden, self-giving, cartoon-stamped, insect-like caricature. Why he is this way is never explained and we get sharp background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of 'In Cold Blood' and his affiliation with the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed author of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his first investigation into crime, and her presence immediately suggests a much more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes in Capote who regret his painful existence. Looking at him is like seeing Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complains about his "delicate back" to someone who will listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to see while Capote is not. The film's precious self-meaning kills it, just as director Bennett Miller is reluctant to add any kind of shadow. Like the morose piano score, the movie is an ethno wonder that gives no contrast, no emotional color, and no intimate drama. If Capote really was this annoying, why make a movie about him and expect the audience to watch it? Although the supporting roles are well done (Chris Cooper is his usual stalwart self), they serve so little dramatic purpose because ultimately it is about Capote (!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman fail to feel emotionally to their target audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's 'legend'. Their product is stillborn Oscar bait ... and is more evidence that a large genre image has more "truth" in than a dozen piles of oh-so-sincere shit like this.
