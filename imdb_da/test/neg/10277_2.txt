It is hard to make a negative statement here after all this rage about how great the judgment course is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. I didn't like the movie. It's crooked! <br /> <br /> There are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs , sex, sex, sex seem to rule their world, I think the director desperately needs to be laid.) The story is just dirty and shameful. I wonder what made these people up with this story. and above all: who cares? <br /> <br /> The technical stuff didn't satisfy me either. the sound is bad, so is editing and the "direction" is absent. Actors are fine, but guess what! It's their job! their job is to shop! No need to jump out of your seats if an actor did a decent job. Do you welcome when a bus driver brings you home safely? see? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after all, this thing had something I can't put into words. b movie charm? camp fun? nudity? I do not know.
