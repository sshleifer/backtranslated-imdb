This is not a horrible movie, just motionless. The ground is deeply erroneous and impossible. It tries to be a number of genres and fails on each. It fails like a comedy, as an exciting thriller and as a horror movie. It almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, sweet cherub face as she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. The only thing that keeps this movie from being 1 in 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is fabulously fake and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. Her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful reach. Other than Marissa Coughlin's delightful exorcist rendition, Mirren is the only reason to watch this movie. A solid 3.0.
