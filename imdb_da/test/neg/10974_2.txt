One wonders how FLYNN could have failed as badly as a cinema release in 1997 with Guy Pearce, who was the lead star. It is not often that casting any such famous is so real. FLYNN was a stumbler at the cashier's office and did not join cinema screens in Australia ... even after LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably by Guy Pearce), FLYNN comes to a relatively robust and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out of steam after the first 35 minutes and with the entrance to hammy Steven Berkoff in a detour to New Guinea (watching and acting as if he wanted the Klaus Kinski role in FITZCARRALDO), the film begins to look like a telephony rather than a bigger one cinema biography. Believe it or not, with approx. 70 minutes drive it is boring and you are happy to see it over. But such a promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the film caused a myth at the cashier's office and, unlike The Bounty, sank without trace.
