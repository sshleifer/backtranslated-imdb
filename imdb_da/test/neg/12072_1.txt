Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (which I have had many times before). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance of the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other films is several characters - variation, witty dialogue. This movie consisted of just one sign - very one-dimensional. It had almost no laughs. It certainly looked good on paper! I think the only thing that was special was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now I have to look for her movie in the future. So in conclusion, this movie was a big disappointment. >
