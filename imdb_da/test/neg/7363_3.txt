As a Canadian story great, my first thing to say: HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT CLOSE! How can a manufacturer do it? The expulsion of the Acadian was not in 1759 when we saw Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can he pass it in the movie? The scenes in Londo were also useless. So to the story of anyone reading "The Ancients Canadians", you have the line of history right there. It's the story of La Coriveau, the "witch". Also add a love story and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ends. Acid, it brought tears to the eyes. But it is. Then there is the fact that it appears to have been set up in Québec City, but it is largely shot at Forteresse de Louisbourg. Sure it's a historic place and that's right at the time, but it was obvious that the scenes weren't all in Québec City. Overall, if you are looking for a documentary from New France, you must get Candad: A People's History, a real documentary about Canda's and NEw France's history. If you want a love story that will bring you tears, see a story in a wonderful forest, see New France.
