This western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre I have seen.I found it too slow. It was just to the inevitable end. I also found it disjointed.i couldn't wait for it to be over. Randolph Scott is the main line here and Lloyd Bridges also stars. but for my money money Edgar Buchanan is the best of the pile. The Buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day, many times giving comic relief as he does in this picture. I also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita. Otherwise, I can't think of much to recommend this movie. The film is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the short story Stagecoach, which was sour in a movie of the same name in 1939 and restored in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach is in my opinion one of The best movies ever made.anyway.as for Abilene Town, my vote is a 3/10
