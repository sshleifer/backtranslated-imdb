Here's the spoiler: At the end of the movie, a little piece of you dies. You will spend the rest of your life in vain for the missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. You will wander around the streets at night in your neighbors' windows as they sit down for dinner. Friends and family will try to find out when you have become the dead. You will answer their questions and concerns with an empty stir and some mumblings about a round testicle. When the AMC inevitably makes Tomcats the "movie of the month", a number of mysterious murders take place in your city. You will wake up the next morning, appearing on the floor of the kitchen with a slight taste of the brain in your mouth. Then you have to climb into the living room and on the sofa. You stare at the wall, wet yourself a little and start laughing maniacally. Because once your dead inside, Jake Busey in a thong is actually pretty strange fun.
