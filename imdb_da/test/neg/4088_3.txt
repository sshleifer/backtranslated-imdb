Although I'm not too much of a religious person, I still had relatively high hopes for this movie when the amazing Steve Carrell and its prequel, Bruce Almighty, were actually a creative and smart Christian-themed comedy. However, Evan Almighty does not come close to this originality and freshness that the original has and cannot determine whether it is a comedy or a sentimental film of faith and family values. If it had chosen a clear path, of which these themes should focus, it could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogue and motives that try to give the film's depth, but instead insult the audience's intelligence and also a very confused and overcast presentation of the film's opaque message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written, there are many plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. Although a large number of exotic animals from all over the world plan to swim to Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, their integration is really needed when the only "flood" in the movie is downtown Washington DC and a suburban neighborhood. , which means they have no risk of being wiped out? The filmmakers seem to lack the originality to modernize the Bible story at all, and instead it just took place in a contemporary time without changing anything to the plot and left many elements that just don't add like that and make it clear of the idiotic motives and write in the movie. All in all, this work is tragic because the dramatic talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes is not exhibited because of the intense characters they portray and that it was so poorly written that it cuts and cuts many of the film's attempts at themes and make a mockery of the first movie. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors in it and every half-way intelligent moviegoer, not failing both of them.
