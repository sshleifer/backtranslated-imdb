very disappointing and incoherent - sometimes a germ of an idea would evolve and be discarded in the next line - it had the feeling of a movie that had been cut and ripped to try to make it work - I bored and distracted all the way through, and I speak like a big fan of the series. Many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired. The medieval section went too long and the quality of the plays was very poor - some on the small guest seats that Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham did more in their allotted 30 seconds than the main cast did in 90 minutes. It's a shame, really. The only really interesting thing was to look inside the little shed on Soho Square - which is something everyone who is ever in that part of London is wondering about.
