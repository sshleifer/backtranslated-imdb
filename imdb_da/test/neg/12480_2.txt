Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he steered a black comedy of sorts, but there is only one problem: it is nausea. I say this by knowing that I like the City of the Walking Dead (which is also rough but not so). A companion gets money for his habit of accommodating ugly and deformed rich women and murdering them and stealing their money. The movie makes this plan look easy. I think the women were too ugly to go to a bank so they always had their money in person. After the thirteenth murder, I began to suspect what I always heard about Fulci: he hated women. He must have. At least this movie stinks, it's not fun, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
