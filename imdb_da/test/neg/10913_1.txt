Not me .. If it came down to it, I could kick a dog's ass and therefore this movie doesn't work for me. If it were me or Alien or Jason .. Or .. Hell, I dunno .. EVERY OTHER HORROR MOVIE ANTAGONIST, then there would be no competition and I would have my ass handed over to me and omit divine intervention. A horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a being, a person, a entity, anything, it is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than they are, and then people think 'well what if it happened me 'they get scared - and that's why it's a horrible idea for a story. I can't imagine being terrorized by a dog, so I'm not scared.
