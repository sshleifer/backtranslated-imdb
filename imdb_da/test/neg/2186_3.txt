OK, so this movie is well acted. It has a good direction, but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all those years. The equal man "decides to be gay" and gay man "Decides to be equal" I have enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes after I was really offended. As usually happens in these films, the same actors play the bulk, and the outgoing homosexuals play the secondary straight roles. The wires are played by beautiful men, but don't let it distract you from the fact that this is a movie that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. All the romance and relationship you hope would happen does not. In that case, unless you are a priest, God bless just woman who heals our homos.
