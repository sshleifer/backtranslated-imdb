Well where do we start, there was a lot of potential for this movie with such great stars that play a role. But the whole story was destroyed by a horrible plot. This movie did not seem to be what I would expect, the good guy makes it live, I think no one wants the good guy to succeed. The end was sharp worthy and very clich√© no one thought what ever you got plotted completely wrong the bad guys would mean coming out successfully. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time using it to do something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors made this movie for some fast Vegas cash without a doubt about it. SAVE your money watching a better movie.
