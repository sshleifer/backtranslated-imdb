After reading the most glowing comments about this movie, I decided to rent it despite some suspicions about TV movies. I should have followed my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to warm up to the movie and profit from it, but I just couldn't. The story never pulls you in or rings true, and the play is at best perfect and ridiculously ridiculous. Everything in this production is amateurish. <br /> <br /> Always a joy to see, Mary McDonnell may be the only one to escape this disaster without harming her career or reputation. I don't even want to bother with the name of the leading man - hopefully he's back in advertising. Even bad Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love and respect, seemed to be channeling Katherine Hepburn all the time as if she was really pulling home. Maybe she needs the money. <br /> <br /> If I can save a person from wasting 100 minutes on this trip, I will feel fair.
