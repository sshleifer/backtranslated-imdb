This is the first recorded effort to make sound with a movie, and one the oldest of course still exists. This historic piece of film is the opening segment of "More Treasures Of The Natural Archives" DVD. It is only a 15 second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a large recording cylinder. Next to him, two men dance. Near the end is another man on the stage. William Dickson, director of this experiment, is a violin player. This "movie" had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really a success. It took over 30 years from this point to synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment. But it was a start, no matter how primitive it was. <br /> <br /> For more of the technical information and history of this movie process, see the other review here by "Boba Fett1138."
