Proud as I am of Dutchman, I'm really shocked by flicks like these. Why? why this cheap deal? Why this story just sucks? Why a dozen followers? why o why? they add many hot Dutch chicks in an effort to save this movie from redemption and guess what? all the underground breezergirlies in the Netherlands go and see it. I was forced to watch it at a party. all the girls were crazy when Daan Schuurmans came in on the screen, all the guys took another beer and muttered ... But what really disturbs me is that this kind of flicks is the only kind of movie Dutch filmmakers can produce ... (except for "Van God Los" and "Play") This does not show our superiority to other countries. It doesn't add anything to our imagination ... It's just F ** ks up in the minds of little 13 year old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you will burn forever!
