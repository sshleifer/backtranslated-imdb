I have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and until a few months ago I had avoided this genre of movies. I had recently had to undergo knee surgery and found that I had a lot of time on my hands as I could not work so I decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video store had to offer, I would take a chance on this. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I have never seen a movie so bad in all my years being a movie addict. This is just a pile of s ** t inserted on a DVD disc and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have great respect for other horror fans who can change their minds long enough to enjoy this shit, they are more brain dead than I will ever be, and this is some achievement! 0/10 and it's generous.
