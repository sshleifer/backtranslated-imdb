This fourth part of the series is the last to get a theatrical release, even though it feels like a direct to video movie. It's okay, but it's nothing special. The action is the worst seen in the series so far. And as the third movie, there is not much in the way of imagination. Also, the phrase "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. Modhee is the pseudonym directors when they have nothing to do with the movie. , it is an acceptable movie in the Hellraiser series, but not much more than that. It's a small drop in quality from number three and a big drop from the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is 4.5 / 10
