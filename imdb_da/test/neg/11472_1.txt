Looked at the director's cut last night ... glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to see this attempt at "movie noir". The anachronisms (modern phones) were annoying to me, not wise, seemingly more like budgetary constraints than anything else. I also found the "non-traditional" casting distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder what is the black chick / drag queen there? "then the narrator has failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and annoying, and very film school finally project-ish. And for your sake, if you have to shoot in black and white, at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color There was no use of shade in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... just black and just white ... boring!
