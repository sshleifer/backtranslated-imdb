Once, back in the 1940s, there was an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big budget, Hollywood photos. Fast forward to the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and all-round bad luck have bothered everyone's favorite actress. Now, a hasbe has decided that time has come to follow in his comrades (?), Joan Crawford's and Bette David's footsteps and fall back on the good owl's reliable horror. But the meat party? Really? She couldn't have been what was washed up. To put it bluntly, Flesh Feast is a lifeless pile of waste, possibly one of the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. The lake plays a scientist who is plotting with Nazis to bring Hitler back to life, with youth restoration attempts by maggots, that's right, maggots. Unless you are a big fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this Veronica Lake person, as well as 40's flicks, but believing that such a successful career actually became so gloomy is actually sad. Flesh Feast is almost impossible to get through, and almost certainly I mean. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of Nudist Camp images, and the man who randomly brought us the biggest B movie ever made, Blood Freak, just a few years later. One has to wonder, is that what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter hadn't co-directed with Steve Hawkes? If so, bless God Steve Hawkes. You wouldn't think that a religious, dope-carnage, Turkey Monster could be so much better than experiments with Maggots and Hitler, but it really is. So forget what you've ever heard of this one and go find Blood Freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. Fast forward a few years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititas, bread and forgotten. The end. I hate you, Flesh Feast. 1.10
