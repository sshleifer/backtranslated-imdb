I agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded. A topic that could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double standard failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Rape was a flood of violence and forced abuse, the scenarios here were mostly pathetic. It would have been a better idea to cover short flashes of what happened and let the audience imagine the act. And the victim laughs with the police when he interrupted his police visit, seemed as real as the police. No one awkward, no hesitation in just joining in. I don't know if this was bad acting and or poor conducting, but someone missed the point altogether. With regard to his half-a-odd search for his attackers, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in itself and made him meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police. The story could then have been drafted with good dialogue and occasional flashback - and rescued by the superior actor and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I saw this movie - brings to any project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this movie is that it was bad.
