Really, the average is the only word that comes to me when you see this. <br /> <br /> The action was average (maybe slightly above average), camera usage was average (actually below average. The picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) The reason was good but moved at such a slow pace and was not used for good. <br /> <br /> This could have been so much more if it didn't go at a snail's pace and we saw more in character backgrounds. All we see are flashbacks here and there in Alice and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is a working-class woman trying to put an end to her and her daughter.) We see a feedback of her, when she was in high school and her friend told her "tell your mother to do some better food" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yes it is embarrassing, but why would you run away from it. <br /> <br /> I could definitely see if her mother was full or someone abusing her, but nothing was wrong with her home unless she was embarrassed by it. How immature! <br /> <br /> We don't even get a glimpse of what the couple's life has been like (apart from having prostitutes for a while, and the woman, forgetting her name, gave her the baby up when it was 9 months old.) This could really have been so much more. It could have had Alice, who was mistreated by her frowning mother, going down to Florida with her friend, but then becoming a prostitute. Or something in line with the other, then the real plot of this movie (that is) Alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of the US population (WORKING CLASS) is flush to Florida, but then becomes sidetracked by becoming a prostitute. <br /> <br /> I can't see why it won a prize at Sundance (it must have been up against some really weak competition to have won one prize.) <br /> <br /> Also for me Alice's Boston / New England accent seemed forced. It didn't seem real. (I should know I was born and raised in Boston, but now living in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 Not really worth your time in my opinion.
