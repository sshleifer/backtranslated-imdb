I really want Hollywood to come up with some new ideas and quick. Instead, they go around recreating and destroying a very good movie with a reproduction. This movie is horrible from the DeMille version. Throughout this movie I told myself, Huh ??? - What???? - I can't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was farewell from the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was a lot much better than this version. Did anyone else know that an atomic or atomic bomb shooting in and out when the Red Sea was separated? I think I did. Anyway, I could - maybe - see the last part tonight. <br /> <br /> I wish Hollywood would tackle different ideas and issues when making new movies. Instead of reviving old movies. <br /> <br /> They should be left well enough alone. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I saw the last part. Made Moses the second copy of the Ten Commandments with his own hand - or I saw things - thank someone - send me an email and let me know. TERRIBLE
