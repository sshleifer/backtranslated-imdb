I didn't even look at this whole movie. Now I like 50's sci-fi movies, even when they are wildly inaccurate, but this one just irritated me. First, a crew member speaks to the spaceship and seems to have made it to the tenth grade. He sounds like he should be in a bowling league, not a spaceship. Out of the spaceship's space, the crew sails on Earth, and these breasts say 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'safe'. And the bubble says 'Gee, I'm wondering who's pitcher?' Forgive me for a moment, I think my pages are splitting. <br /> <br /> When they first get into orbit, the bubble says' The Moon is just for watching! Take me back! "Looking at the crew that makes stretched mouths and screams from the G forces with acceleration during start-up is also not one of the better moments in the movie. (Perhaps the best moment of the movie can be identified by a big" END "on the screen.) < br /> <br /> We also find that they cannot open the hatch because the 'bubble' smeared it before they left, sure that a spacecraft was being smeared by a crew member who we later learn has never had a space package before and didn't know anything about zero gravity. Like Baby Huey, the overgrown cool cartoon spirit once said, "It sounds logical!" The effect of the difficulty in space is so bad it is painful to see. , in the absence of gravity, tends to go up.) <br /> <br /> How the movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10 when other very superior movies don't rate anything higher is a mystery to me. really do like old sci-fi movies, but one is not realistic, and the lame attempts at character humor It's by throwing the bob from a gas station's fat pit doesn't work at all - it just destroys the movie. I think it's not the whole movie, I hate so much the fact that the 'bubble' is so obviously not someone who would be on a spaceship - not even 'fire the hatch'. OMG. I wonder if he also checks the fan belts. Perhaps if they had left the 'boob from the trip, it could not have been so scary. Yet it is only average. What everyone else is raging about, I do not know. <br /> <br /> You want to see a nice 1950's space movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats it all for picking. Maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less fallen characters.
