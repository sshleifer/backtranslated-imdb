This movie has just arrived in Mexico and when I read very good reviews about it, I decided to see it with my friends and boyfriend, but I was very disappointed, I do not understand how people can judge it 10/10 I Thinks manuscript and conducting were beautiful, but a great overall movie needs a good story, as this flip was completely missing. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several dramatic Asian and European films, but they had a good story, watching this movie at your own risk, unless you are Eastern European or Orthodox, I don't think you would like it. <br /> <br /> Half the people in the theater left, including my 4 friends who were waiting outside, when they were really bored, so I was but I always wait for the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie, it was extremely slow, with many time-consuming scenes, the full length of history could have been shown for a maximum of 40 minutes, but they did it longer by having the monk's scenes get cool, which is like 15 minutes of the whole movie plus panoramic views and so on until they made it a full-length movie a really boring one. <br /> <br /> I recommend listening to me if you still see it coming back and reviewing this comment as helpful by departments to help people avoid this waste of money.
