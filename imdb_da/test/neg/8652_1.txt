Oh my God, why have I wasted my precious time on this movie? It's pathetic, being OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Yes, my life. I'm embarrassed by the Yash Raj movie, the poor people have to live with the terrible news that yes, they produced this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most sweet, sexual eyebrow movie I've ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I cringe for those I really do. Along with the terrible play (or nothing acting) of Uday Chopra, coupled with the lack of talent in "Look At My Boobs" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki doesn't have a good thing at all. Even the music is not up to the standard left by the YRF. The director, Arjun Sablok, did an embarrassingly bad job here. <br /> <br /> I honestly expected more. A whole lot more.
