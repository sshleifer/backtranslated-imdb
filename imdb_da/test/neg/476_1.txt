Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to the Americans and let alone that they don't have the slightest idea of ​​where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There is a war going on, right?" or "I never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria, people have internet" See Bruce Campbell's "The Man With The Screaming Brain". I was curious about this movie because 1) I'm Bruce Campbell fan - the "Evil Dead" trilogy and "The Brisco County Jr. Adventures" 2) The movie was shot completely in place in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which also is almost unattainable. 3) I enjoy nice B movies <br /> <br /> Well ... The movie presents our country as an infinite gypsy city where they raid your car, waves around illegal weapons, and you can be killed for a moment. And Bruce's "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" line is more than insulting. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a good team, Bruce makes his special - get up and that's all. No more to see here. <br /> <br /> Peoeple gives this movie 10 just because of Bruce's cult status, but it does not deserve more than 3. Film waste.
