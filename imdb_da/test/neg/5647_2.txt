A rather horrible movie, I am amazed that Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave agreed to be in it, it is like a prolonged episode from a bad TV detective series. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake should be Vinnie Jones, he simply can't act who had the bright idea of ​​throwing him as a leading man, wanting their head investigated unless he puts his own money in project? He should stick to playing bullies, look threatening and NOT speak! <br /> <br /> Also, central heating was around in Dickens times as there were three large radiators behind his desk ?? <br /> <br /> No wonder they gave it away for free with a newspaper, as no one would pay to see it.
