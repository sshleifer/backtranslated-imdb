Wealthy businessman daughter who, as a young girl got rheumatic fever and now suffers from shortness of breath, discovers her marriage with a charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by Dad (whom she lovingly refers to as "Darling"); Worse than that, she can actually just have a few weeks left to live, and free her husband to marry her royal romantic rival. Clean bunk bed. Paul Osborn's manuscript (via Jerome Weidman's thin story) adorns the superfluous flashbacks in the second half instead of continuing with the plot, suppressing the already-sobering scenario of grim talk. Why go back when we can find out what's happening to ourselves? This is a "woman's weeper" without faith in the target group, so simplistic is the setup. Dorothy McGuire, who is cut in fur most of the picture, is not at all a clever, wise hero; When she is sad, she turns inward and stoned. When she realizes that her marriage is basically a shame, she shrinks away from her husband as the perfect virgin (it is a possibility that she and Van Johnson sleep in separate beds!). Ruth Roman has the movie's best moments as a social shark with her trap set to Van, but what do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming when needed, but put him in a melodramatic setting, and he also goes stony. MGM production unfortunately only values, but director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add visual flavor to the flashback stories, and he tries a lively pacing for the film's first half hour. ** from ****
