I was invited to watch this movie because I heard the good word: it should be this exciting sand crime milestone, disturbing, shocking ... all that jazz. Well, I'm disturbed because I spent money on it, and I'm shocked that something so godly was actually released. It's about it. <br /> <br /> This is a supposed "new look" by Charles Manson's family of crazy losing junkies and their murders. But if this is a "new look" then it is probably "new" as in "fresh and completely incomplete": just seeing it gave me headaches and I had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even Understand what the director intended to be. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should say something about the plot, but actually it is so stupid and incoherent that I hardly remember if there was even a plot at all. There was something about a "Manson tape" that was delivered to a radio DJ (or a TV producer?), Watching a timeless random "family" recording in '69, so the Polanski murders (resembling a bad school game ) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skin skin becomes full and beats the hell out of each other in a spawn (I don't ask you) and then it ended (thank goodness) (don't ask me to make any sense of it, I remember Just what I saw!) The performance was also horrible. And how difficult is it to make a compelling "Manson"? Get a short, shiny, shriveled ink, put a dirty wig and a beard beard on him. There's your Manson. But this "Manson" doesn't even look right. He just looks like a disadvantage in a cheap wig and a glue on black beard painted black. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this is what this movie really is about: Manson's family made no sense, so this movie also makes no sense. It's symbolic! (Yes, right) I'm still so angry about spending money on this I stopped my normal cheats on this site and just registered to vote 1 for this movie and send this warning, hopefully preventing others from spending the money on this waste . Stay away from it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent American television production "Helter Skelter" got bad reviews here, but I saw it last month (I also saw the 1976 original) and let me tell you, in relation to "Manson Family" that the new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS. And I was disappointed with it! It's so bad "Manson Family" is: it makes a flawless and mostly disappointing television movie look perfect.
