Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and alluring woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies I've seen her in, she looks to me as the exact same character. Whether it's in DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDING DER LIEBE and now WO IST PEACE! She is always (playing?) The young, kind-hearted woman who is a little naive and does not know how to handle the things that happen to her. She has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly. I have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and somewhat unpleasant character because it just isn't in here. So she is typecast as the nice girl next door as she is, but once again she is not snuff when it comes to acting. To Schweiger: Same thing! Movie: Just stupid. As it was an American movie, it would have been a huge role for Adam Sandler, whom I also dislike. I was not offended by the fact that this is a movie with disabled people in it, I just thought the jokes were not fun. I chuckled twice or three times, but when I was halfway through, I was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flip to end.
