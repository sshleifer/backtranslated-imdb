When you come in front of a movie, you know you're wasting your time watching that movie. That was how I felt as I saw "Dark". I could see anticipating every twist and turning lightly. It is a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a myriad of films dealing with the occult. It's so stupid that I almost found endearing its naiveness. I can't say I was totally sorry, but I found the movie too derivative to my taste. Director Balaguer√≥ tries to make his early Spanish hit "The Nameless", but he can't pull it out. I admit that a few sequences were scary enough, but I just detest when I can figure out what's going to happen next time. I also hated watching good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much about this piece of drunk. Finally, Anna Paquin as the star of a horror movie? This must be a joke. She is cute, but she is one of the good children's actors who has become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without seeing this.
