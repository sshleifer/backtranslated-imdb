Harry Knowles has a quote right on the front of the DVD stating "The Next Icon of Horror" Really?!?!?!? I heard a lot of hype around this one, but wasn't quite convinced. But I am a die hard horror fan and will give almost any horror movie a chance. No matter the budget or rating, you never know where to find the next gem. Not here. Not the Hatchet. The hatch is poorly conceived, badly acted and unhappy. Just because you have the actors who played Freddy Jason and Candyman and a Buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror. I don't even want to describe the plot because it's so idiotic. Honestly my money is on Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows old school fear. Forget about this bin.
