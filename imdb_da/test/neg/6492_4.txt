Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solids, but he goes too far one night and inadvertently makes himself four-dimensional! Atomic-age fantasy is quite charming in a very cheesy way. Perhaps it was considered a thought-provoking sci-fi of its time (with psychological overtones), but today the film is seen mildly overcrowded and naive; It's a camp party tailored to the late-night TV show. Wood performances of Lansing and Lee Meriwether are as small as one-dimensional, although Patty Duke (playing a sweet steep pre- "Miracle Worker") gets a colorful and memorable exit. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
