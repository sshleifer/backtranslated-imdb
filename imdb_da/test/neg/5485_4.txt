This is my first Almodavar movie. I admit that we chose it primarily because we knew this had the enticing view of Antonio Banderas in gay scenes. Unfortunately, it's all about this movie recommending it. I consider myself a rather sophisticated viewer, I like European films, "art" films, and I can generally recognize a quality film, even though it is not my own taste. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a complete blank for me. The reason was ridiculous, the characters were lifeless, the box called it a "hilarious comedy", but I didn't even laugh. Loosely and awkwardly constructed, with a lot of meaningless dialogue. I don't get it at all - it seems like an amateurish effort. Can anyone tell me?
