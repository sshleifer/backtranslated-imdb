Lonesome Dove is my favorite Western second just for The Searchers with John Wayne. I see Lonesome Dove about every 6 months and never get tired of it. I've read all the LD books, though I can't remember much of Comanche Moon. I also looked forward to this mini-series and decided to tape it on our DVR so we could accelerate through advertising. Unfortunately I broke up and did not record the first part, but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can ever compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones and I expected to be disappointed and I was. Although there were so many things that did not ring true, it was most visible to me when Nellie died the day before, and Gus was out of reach, changing over to Clara writing a letter from Nebraska to him to tell him where sorry to hear about her death. How in the world could she have known the next day out in Nebraska? Besides, it should be 7 years later after she left, and her children seemed to be about. 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, but still time passed before they actually moved to Lonesome Dove, and in Lonesome Dove they had been there about 10 years or longer before traveling to Montana. When they stopped at Clara in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the track, the girls were about. 10-13 when they played on the farm as young children. The math just doesn't add. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had many of his manuscripts and, as little as Gus, might have looked like a young man. <br /> <br /> I'm also a little confused about one thing. The catching white girl they brought back - was she the one they caught when they razzer Austin? They said she had been caught 25 years ago, but if she was the one caught in Austin, it was only 7 years later when this took place in the movie. Was she caught earlier? I remember seeing a captured girl as they raided the town and didn't know if it was the same. If anyone can explain since I missed part 1. If it had been 25 years, she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her since she seemed to be cultivated lying on the ground. Also, the way they ravaged her when they caught her, it's hard to believe she would have lived to get married and have Indian children. I have to admit that nothing is worse than John Voight playing Call in the sequel to Lonesome Dove or the incredible marriage of Lorena to the Honor in the McMurty sequel to Lonesome Dove, which is never explained. Also, the way he killed Newt, I could hear, even though they did the sequel to John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If anyone can clean up these discrepancies, I would appreciate it.
