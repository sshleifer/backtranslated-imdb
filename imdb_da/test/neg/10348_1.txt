Should I say more? The reason why the good Australian version of Kath and Kim were as mentioned good was because of the hilarious fun originality. The reason why this new American version is so horrible is that a lot is taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity of the sign. Kath is supposed to be one day. Kim must be fat. Kel (or Phil as they have called him) is supposed to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is supposed to be a loser, not a person who seems to be on heroin and finishes every sentence with 'guy'. Thank goodness Szubanski did not sell her rights to Sharon, she would probably end up being a tall thin blonde that Kim likes. Kath and Kim are MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. They are not supposed to look 2 years apart. And they are not meant to giggle as school girls. This show is a disgrace to share the same title as the Australian version. America: Get your own TV shows.
