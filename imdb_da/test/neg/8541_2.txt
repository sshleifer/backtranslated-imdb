A group of adventurers travels to the 'dark continent' to try to find a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years earlier in a plane crash, and who is now believed to live with a savage tribe who considers her to be their goddess . <br /> <br /> Once again, my search for swayed European cannibal movies has taken me deep into the Jess Franco territory. A seemingly endless biographical wilderness swarms with sub-par scriptwriting, crap-crawling work and plenty of horrible acting (Franco Regular Lina Romay takes the prize this time for her graceful performance as a scary older woman). It is here in this hell place that I finally stumbled upon Diamonds of Kilimanjaro, an eerie jungle-based exploitation so badly that it took me three consecutive evenings to finish seeing it. <br /> <br /> Tawdry and unrelenting boring, even by Franco's standards, fail this worn-out piece of waste at almost every level: the story is a terribly dull lead by Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan, albeit with a feminine twist; The film seems to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens, though grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a meaningless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in Africa; and the death scenes are almost bloodless (Franco can usually be relied on for some splatter, but despite the first appearances this is not a cannibal movie and it is not so gory). However, the director succeeds in his casting of sexy young Katja Bienert as jungle jail-bait Diana. Continuing and jumping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy linen cloth, her curved bodice illuminated that she was only sixteen at that time, giving this noble beauty a pretty impression. Franco also throws in some extra nudity with courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions) and Aline Mess as topless warrior woman Noba, thus avoiding narrowing another 1/10 rating from me (though I'm sure he'll receive much more in the future? I have lots of his movies yet to see).
