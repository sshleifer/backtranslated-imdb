This ultra-low budget kitchen-sink gab is the kind of movie that can only be made in the UK in what anywhere else in the world the fact that a market would have to exist before a green light would be given. Probably self-financed, this is clearly an attempt to address important issues, but ultimately undermines its point of existence, asking the question who will ever put money into distributing it and, secondly, if a market group does not exist to see , buy or rent this movie, why should anyone interfere in the first place? My statements may sound unfairly hard on a first-time instructor, but that is the kind of movie that only seeks to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards that only a British film industry has held.
