Quintet marks the only venture from both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman into science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not make comedy, but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot. But the mistake in this movie left him wildly shy and he never tried it again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest downer movies I've ever seen. It's a futuristic ice age, brought on by who knows what, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. Even thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth have maintained animal and human life, but apparently not here. Seals has survived, and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside. <br /> <br /> But the hunters need a little R&R, and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring that the natives have played some kind of game with six people, and that's a kind of Russian roulette. To win, kill five other players in your game. <br /> <br /> It is a sad trip to see which man has come down to. That's one reason I just couldn't get into this story. The atmosphere is gloomy, the story is bleak, the people are gloomy, it's all so bleak. It is no wonder that this thing came up short in the picture office. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that almost everyone believes will never be on the top ten list of Paul Newman movies, including me. <br /> <br /> This is man's future, what a bummer.
