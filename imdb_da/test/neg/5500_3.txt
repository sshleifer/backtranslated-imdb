This film had a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very scary. But of course, tim burton doesn't make scary movies, he makes crazy cinematic movies. and i usually like tim burton's stuff. but I thought this movie was really weak. The best thing about the movie (and it's actually worth seeing just that) was the art direction - the film has a fantastic intangible quality for it. The script was not good. it was dull in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no building sign. I have never really looked after people having their heads out of a headless being. i thought johnny depp had a good thing with his approach to the character, but when the script was weak he could not go too far with it - and i was very annoyed by the trials with a small accent on his and christian ricci's parts. <br /> <br /> unfortunately, it is not a good movie and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction.
