This movie was completely outdated and uninspired. The key prerequisite for this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop who exchanged painfully unfunny repartee. I didn't even laugh during the whole movie. I could have sat in any hair salon in America and heard this banal banter, and maybe even come out with a decent haircut. I can't understand why this mess got any positive reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here were funny or worth worrying about. I really didn't care if the rival barbershop across the street would get Nappy Cutz out of service. Don't waste your money on this, people, as this is the only way to stop Hollywood from eradicating these shambol pieces of waste. 1 * out of 5
