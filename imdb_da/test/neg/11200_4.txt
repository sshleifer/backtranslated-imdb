I went out of my way to get this movie and was lucky to get it on VHS. Being a great Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Apart from that, I really can't say much to recommend this picture. The reason is predictable (and weak), and the only interesting aspect of the movie is Sterling Hayden getting into deeper problems with her own department. Mrs. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her as I do), but it does mean that hearing her song hurts this picture. She works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. It can only borrow to the atmosphere. I have to agree with a previous reviewer; The end borrows heavily from the big heat. To the point of detracting from the end. I have seen worse movies with Mrs Grahame (MACAO), but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on the screen. If you have a movie night and are looking for another movie, it's your movie. Enjoy the picture.
