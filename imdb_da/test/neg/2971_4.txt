Silly comedy casts a bothered Ray Milland as a British officer in World War II, Europe escaping German borders and taking up a man-hungry gypsy woman, played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow, slow and miscast: The wires are too old for this type of juvenile food, even though Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three writers to adapt Yolanda Foldes' book to the screen, but this material must already have been dated 1947 - it tastes like something Ernst Lubitsch might have appeared in 1939. The scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together. ** from ****
