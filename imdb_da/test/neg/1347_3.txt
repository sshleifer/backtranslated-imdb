This movie could have been a decent re-entry, and gosh knows it was trying (or mrs. English tried). Collection of talented actors along with a successful and experienced writer / instructor should be a formula for a decent movie. But M's English experience - according to her IMDb cinema - is limited to television work, and it is clearly evident throughout this film. I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found the most incredible about this movie, and what kept it from reaching itself a part of its potential: it looked and felt it was made for television. To give honors to English, many of the jokes that simply didn't work on a movie screen would have been great on television (and maybe a laugh would have helped). So much of the camera's use and the lighting would have played fine on television, but so scary or odd on a big screen. If the whole movie had been cut into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is a movie theater and unfortunately no English talent didn't translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors and the authors, which I felt I came out of the theater, half shriveled! My Ryan is her usual perky, sweet self (except for the terrible plastic surgery she's had on her face), but where does she have a chance to use her talent? She made movies where she did not re-create her stereotypical role and made them good ... but not here. Annette Bening simply seemed to go through the movements - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women's characters but they were more caricature than fabric and it was sad to see. What worked in this movie in the 1930s didn't translate into the 2000s, and no one helped mrs. English to get changes and updates or features right. If only she (as author, director and producer) had come to the aid, I think it could have been good. But it was not. <br /> <br /> Going to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director is so frustrating to come away because it was a waste of time and money for everyone! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie samples have a meeting and the caption reads, "Let's recreate a classic with all the worse!"
