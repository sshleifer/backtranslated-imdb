For those who can't remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - this came out in '79 (I think the time has gone so naturally that Nunzio could count this and say, that he wrote it - yes, right!). The action in this is a way overboard - the "heavy guys" go around with their shoulders forward to give the impression that they are bigger than they really are "the hero" seems to have a passion for snorting and rolling his eyes on a bug eyed way to express anxiety / anger to the celluloid eye. There is some sort of race announcement here, from the Sicilian perspective (remember, it's about the 3rd generation down the queue ... the original "wogs" arrived in OZ after the war and in my childhood - yes I'm an Aussie. So "wog unit" has been diluted a lot - they even sound like sandy blue Aussies - not a flicker of "dago accent" anywhere (there's another snake for you, Nun!) <br /> <br /> Maori is with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4 o'clock - must be cool to be sun-blind in the middle of the night and it looks like Redfern ... it's in this movie's boring end. Nunzio tried to copy Warrior's taste, but left too many gaps in history. What by chance? <br /> <br /> The warriors had a gang of baseball guys guys wielding bats, with white face makeup chasing heroes to a train station and fighting them - Nunzio's gang is being hunted at a railway station with a gang of stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks The warriors were mistakenly charged with shooting / killing another gang edlem - Nunzios gang is wrongly accused of raping the sister of the great maori gang leader. The warriors are lured into a room by a girl girls who are attacking them - Nunzio's crowd will clash on a friends house populated by, smooth, a gang of girls - there are almost too many copies from the warriors to hold on here. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry people don't want to see other moves from OZ because of this trip - what about Mad Max - Commander and World Champion? Not all movies are made by actors who are so bad they have to fund their own movies. <br /> <br /> As for the other players in this show, they seem to have taken their cue from "The Nun" as they are all as bad as each other - don't bother with this movie! I can't get my money back - so scared of you!
