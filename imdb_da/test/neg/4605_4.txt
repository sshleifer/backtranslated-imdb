Perry Mason: Case of the Glass Coffin finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield / Rick Blaine as magician Peter Scolari from a murder charge with one of his assistants. A trick involving a suspended glass box in midair goes wrong and Nancy Grahn's body comes out. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of six female assistants working on the plot and we learned two things about her. Only in a moment of intoxicated weakness was Scolari seduced by her, and she claims she was impregnated. Second, she lives under an assumed name and has a secret from her past. Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would do so hard in the law, had to be pampered with a couple of good old boys as they seek the truth in Grahn's hometown. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he is almost killed. <br /> <br /> A big mistake in this mystery is simple forensics. The medical examination report should have given concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not have done the act. The police should have looked in another direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> When you see who the killer is, you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how investigator James McEachin got it wrong from the start. It kind of destroys this Mason movie.
