This was one of the worst movies I can see. I'm sure I've seen worse if it softens me to slam it. <br /> <br /> Humor is not fun, there are stupid stereotypical jokes that are not fun anymore. I was a caught audience on a plane and watched this movie. It was a complete waste of time. I've had Martin in previous films, but not this one. The same for Queen Latifah, she was excellent in Chicago, and in Set it Off she was also good, but this role was horrible. I mostly credit the lack of script writing. I strongly feel that you cannot save a formal, scary script with decent actors, this movie as a point of point. Nevertheless, everyone involved should have been wise enough not to participate in this film. I'm just amazed that something so bad can get green light, made, released theatrically and promoted.
