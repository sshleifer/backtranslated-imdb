This is a weird movie. On the surface it is no different than many other d-grade gore films, but in at least some ways it stands out. First, the main killer character is really strange. How stupid a guy who only ever complains like a chicken that is parole is completely beyond me. What did the female parole table think: "He is completely reformed and rehabilitated". He chuckles! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the women's script / direction. The daughter is so pathetic and apparently stupid that if she was mine, I hit her. She tries to loosen her mother out of bed and struggles with knots and just doesn't think: "I get scissors or a knife". Later, in a similar attempt to loosen her mother, she walks down the stairs and starts searching a box of scrap-booking things for some scissors, eventually getting a knife. This is after the killer has left the car and just returned. Bizarre. On the plus side, the daughter got her kit out to the shower scene, so it was nice even though it was unusual again. It seems that in many of these d-grade gore films, they happily show that the throat is bitten open with gushing blood, but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the audience. In general, it worked, but it was annoying and uncomfortable, even if they just made some of it.
