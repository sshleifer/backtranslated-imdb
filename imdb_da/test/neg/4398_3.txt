Jeez, when I heard this movie was a NATIONAL LAMPOONS, I thought it would be great, but I really got one saying it was a pretty disappointing one. I've seen most movies they've made, from Christmas holidays to van wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their name, really bad actors and a very intense movie. this movie is probably good to see if you see it with a crowd of reputed people and the ability to laugh at it, but if you are in good comedy as I am, I do not suggest this movie, I would much rather watch van wilder another or third time than watching this movie ... you have been warned.
