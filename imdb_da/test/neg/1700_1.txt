Jason Connery is not an actor; He is the son of an actor. His Macbeth is the worst I have ever seen. Oh yes, he kills King Duncan, but he also kills William Shakespeare. His wife is even worse. Please give me Polanski's version on DVD so I can forget about this monster. Jon Finch, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, you have ACTORS!
