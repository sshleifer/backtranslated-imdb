This movie was horrible, and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far left. I consider myself moderate so I could see this movie as the pile of waste it was. While I'm not a Bush fan, your aversion to GW is not enough of a reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the film was shot on such low film that it comes out as cheap, rather than artistic. In addition, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. Chris Cooper's character was a bad parody of George Bush; better suited to Saturday Night Live saw a dramatic movie. The rest of the characters have gone clich√©s and are bad facsimiles of other characters from much better movies. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
