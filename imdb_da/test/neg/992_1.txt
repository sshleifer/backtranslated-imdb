on a Saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mother let me go because she thought the movie would be ok (it is rated G). I was assaulted by loud music, STRANGE pictures, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense. We went halfway through because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. <br /> <br /> I saw it 22 years later in a wake-up theater. My opinion was changed - it's even BEING! Basically everything I hated about it was still there and the movie was very sixty ... and dated badly. I have all the little digs ... too bad they weren't funny. The constant shifts in tone quickly became annoying and there is absolutely nothing to get a good grip on. Some people will love this. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the movie I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, all of Monkee's songs in this movie SUCK (and I make them like them). <br /> Only for ex-hippies ... or if you are stoned. I give this a 1.
