The essence of just about any really big crime thriller is a carefully considered, methodically planned out high stakes super-crime that 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch similar, grayscale morality underdogs for whom life is not fair, for who comes back to the man, it is well worth the cheer. First time writer James V. Simpson's script for Armored gets this half to the right. He doubted that we only have compassion for the recently orphan Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short), who is to have his house taken by a vicious bank (brother, I've been there). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super handsome and makes him work on the armored car company he works with with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and a weird French guy (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play pranks, but they are also serious armored cars so they carry weapons and are tough. After a short period of time, which theoretically sees Armored, one might begin to think like I did, that maybe - just maybe - this will be a kind of great, heavy-in-cheek, cornball hoist movie with some on-the- -nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course, entice the personal efforts of all involved in the hope of revealing a truly, really smart plan with lots of potential 'sacred sh * t' moments. I think the music alone is textbook heist-movie - gritty, edgy beats working overtime, as we are treated to close-ups of characters that say things like "In fact I do it" and "Are you crazy?" In 45 minutes or so the movie had some serious genre flicke potential. <br /> <br /> Then things really start to stink. These dudes, these idiots, have no plans. There is no "Ok, here's what to do ..." scene, no blueprints, no explosives, no black van or ski masks (despite their "test run" as it can be seen in a trailer) . No, these guys will steal $ 42 million from their own trucks (only tracked by the HOURLY radio contact, despite being equipped with a fancy, big deal 'GPS technology') and they won't even Sit down and discuss it. Hell, Mike only tells Ty about the plan the night before, which is quite ridiculous. But of course, Ty has his house to think of as long as Mike promises "no one will hurt," he is aboard. Guess what, though. Someone gets hurt. Why? Because, in addition to driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money, they have no plans. Thats it. It was so far, they thought things out. So of course things start to rave up. These cats deserve everything they get to be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this script seems to be a product of a bad improvisation game: "Armored Car, robbed by its own guards ... GO!" Having taken the film in a few interesting directions, the story goes completely apart, and it is pretty soon, nothing means or is even extremely plausible. <br /> <br /> When filmmakers don't have a cool "hook" for their heist, their characters seem stupid and dizzy. And when characters are stupid and dangling, it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their history. And when that happens, every thrill runs out at the bottom of the movie and leaves a ridiculous, hollow foam. <br /> <br /> Skip it. 3.10
