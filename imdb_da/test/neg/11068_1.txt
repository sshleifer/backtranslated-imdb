I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide range of movies. But I found no pleasure in this movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't feel that it had much of a story, the characters were not pleasant, and the relationship between the signs was at best dysfunctional, and the end made me more than movie more. It is certainly not in the same category as "The Cave", which in my opinion was the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of the rental fee of $ 3.79 and my time to see this. Do yourself a favor and avoid this.
