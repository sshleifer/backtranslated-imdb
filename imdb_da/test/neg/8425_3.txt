After reading so many glowing reports of "To serve them all my days" I went out and bought it for Christmas. Waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to something in the same league as "Brideshead Revisited" and some of the few other great productions from British television, but it certainly isn't among them. The people are too good to be true, swathed in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eye-rolling script I've heard this year. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The main actor is interesting, mostly because of his eerie resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), only dark. But his undoubted talents are wasted on a character that is insufficiently self-sufficient and priggish. His prickliness is attributed to the effect of his experiences in Somme during World War I. He makes the early episodes centered on his nervous state better than he plays the squeaky clean, socialist do-goods later. <br /> <br /> The women are amazing, as in un-real. His first wife is annoying chipper and chirpy, girlfriend, the perfect sophisticated slam, and the last lady a hodge-podge of political bosom. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters named Hobarth, I forget the actor's name. The haughty preaching of the script is typically Andrew Davies, screenwriter, in his early years, and becomes tiring within the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). At episode 4 I just wanted to get through the blasted thing. <br /> <br /> The music is just as boring, mostly limited to a mawkish piano tune and a coral song of boys under the credits. No expense was saved on the placement settings, giving some visual relief to an otherwise eerie experience. <br /> <br /> I usually like stories of this kind and are very disappointed with this series. If you want to see something riveting about WW1 and its aftermath, there are many other much finer vehicles for rent or purchase. The one that comes to mind is 'The Unknown Soldier' ​​from 1998. The characters in the masterpiece presentation are genuine and fascinating and move one, unlike the 2-dimensional dolls in 'To serve them all my days'. As for the films of boys' schools, stick to 'Goodbye, Mr Chips' or' Tom Brown's Schooldays'. <br /> <br /> I know this goes against the overall beneficial perception of this mini-series, but I strongly recommend thinking twice before shelling out $ 80.00 for Acorn Media for their 4 DVD set 2 discs, which on my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and jumping.
