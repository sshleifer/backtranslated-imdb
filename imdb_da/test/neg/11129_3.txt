What a dull movie. While it had humorous parts, it was simply boring and far (for a 90 minute movie). I think the cause was a lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I expected to see white blood cells fight the evil viruses, but not such luck. It was more that the virus was disturbed than defeated. <br /> <br /> The movie had promise, but when it was made for young children, I didn't think of its potential.
