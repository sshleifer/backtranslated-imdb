It is important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The * buzz generated on this site far exceeds the real effect of the movie. What can help anyone see the movie is to realize that it's not meant to be scary. It's a clean camp and an attempt at fun. It's not - funny - just campy. Don't expect anything like the SHAUN's dying or something like Friday the 13th (part II through infinity). HATCHET has adorable players. The kinematics are just Ed Wood. Creature effects and makeup are stupid - probably on purpose. Gore and blood is something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is a movie of betweenness. It is between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It is between campy and comedy (there is a difference). It is between ultra-violent and violent cartoon. Instead of "capturing the essence of American horror" or any other silly jargon that has been used to describe the movie, it tries to capture something between the usual - American - Horror as Friday the 13th and new horror as SHAUN. Fortunately, it keeps away from the Torture Horror. In the end, the HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think more and more people involved in movies are streaming to websites like IMDb to judge and comment on the movies they are involved in. At least, campaigns are for people who is associated with affiliates, to leave positive feedback and reviews. There is no other reason why this movie has stood out in the high 7s with 600 votes and soon falls off after broad release. This movie is just as good as the HorrorFest releases and should not be so bloated.
