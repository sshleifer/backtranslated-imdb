Well, since all the director / manufacturing company's friends and relationships have written their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals, then I bother it's time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it. <br /> As the director's "Dear Jesse" (the only other of his movie I've seen), "Loggerheads" suffer from a lack of focus and too many ideas that are stepped into an indie budget. I swear, this guy might be lucky enough to make miniseries. I waited for the various plot threads to come together, but they only intercepted points that blatantly shaded in a way that was obvious to everyone, but the most dense viewer. It was like watching a season of Lifetime made-for-TV movies framed in a long (I said LOOONG) sketch on the old "Carol Burnett" show. Maybe an entertaining male lawyer could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim "Hey ... remember all the chick flicks we went to last year ... the one about the adoptive mother ... the one about the gay guy. about the Christian housewife, we went to THREE Chick Flicks last year, so now we need to see Terminator 4! "I have to do something to throw a well-known actor to get funding, but what oh, what does Bonnie Hunt do in this flick ? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this attempt at "performance" will not send Mr. Oscar for her door. I mean (talking about Lifetime Original Movies), wasn't Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett available? Ms. Hunt has always come to me as cold, maybe she should have played the other mother? I wish I would have chosen "Capote" to complete my weekly Gay-themed Indie Allowance. Well, maybe next week. I think there is a good reason why Capote plays at tons of theaters across the NYC area and this only plays with one; Let the distributors' belief in this flick be sure to drive in the opposite direction if you do not trust this review!
