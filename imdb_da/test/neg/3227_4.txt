Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are graduates on their way to Cape Cod to stay with Goldthwait's grandmother this summer. Along the way, they encounter Demi Moore, pursued by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang. Soon, the three are united in trying to save a house from being transformed into another lobster restaurant by a creeping, spoiled family, who consider "work" a dirty word. The movie features several fun vignettes such as millionaire dollar radio contest gags and Godzilla shit. <br /> <br /> Like Holland's first film, Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds immensely to the movie. Otherwise, this is a dud of a movie filled with preferred situations and idiotic characters (unlike quirky). Moore even sings some bars in a nightclub with some awful synthesizers. Goldthwait's gags wear thin after a while, and Armstrong was never an actor of any caliber to be seen in anything except Class Z stuff. The carriage's twins are extremely annoying and unpleasant instead of the recovering underdogs they are supposed to be. This is more a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy that could have used a better script and direction. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
