Clearly, as the chance to see this horrible infamous play of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They were not low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman has somehow been in possession of the rights to produce the Marvel comic characters once in the late 80s or early 90s and handed it to Oley Sassone whose direct work has largely been in campy TV shows like Hercules and 'Viper'. With an assumed total budget of $ 1.5 million, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the destruction of forgotten movies. It should have been there. But as a banana peel in a vaudeville action, this "Fantastic Four" is put into the air and is waiting to have a chat for the rare people who are unlucky and stupid enough to step on it. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these cartoon characters, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very faithful to the source material, and that is the only thing they deserve any credit in this failure. This presents the origin of the heroic group that develops superhuman forces when the foreclosure on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes "Mr. Fantastic'. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) may become invisible, and her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to break out of his body. Finally, Ben Grimm ("credited" to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength as his skin mutates to a stone-like elevation and then called The Thing. There is a prologue who creates a former classmate of Reed's, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become their enemy, Dr. Doom, which orchestrates the sabotage of Fantastic Four's spaceflight as a vengeance for the damage he inflicted on Reed. There is the setup, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climate fight. There are more details for the poorly written script, but they are insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made simply because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the word. There is nothing a lot of creative imagination in the workplace here) had the legal rights to to do it. The plot will undoubtedly be reflected in the expected large budget release to be directed by Tim Story in 2005, but dealing with a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors is an act of cinematic insanity. What special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'The Great Train Robbery'. When half of the climatic battle returns to full animation, you are almost relieved to look at a comic book instead of the poor actors who were cursed for being in this project. There is also very little consistency of style in this mess as well. Most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors, and the only clad sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. There is camera work, but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience. Editing involves loading in extra lines and using obvious rags (at some point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). Editing spins are even used to complement the bad special effects when The Thing transforms. The one scene where morphing technology was used was only shocking because it was such a positive jump in quality. Limited camera work is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks' only the most basic camera movements are used, and there is almost no style. It worked for that movie because it was about people whose lives had no style and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his understanding. 'The Blair Witch Project' caused some audiences to suffer from motion sickness from the jerky handheld stuff that put the pseudo documentary together. When all was said and done, it was an effective work of terror to get lost and be consumed by a frightening situation. There is no sense of history or theme here at either speech or visual level. With this 'Fantastic Four' you will never be more than an unintentional grin to the fact that the filmmakers and artists seem to be trying to compete with other comic strips with this bad budget entry. <br /> <br /> Every movie involves a great deal of time and work. It was just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. If you are one of the people involved in this, it was most likely done as a step in the direction of a (hopefully improved) movie career. Everyone knows how to take jobs to get the most out of what seems to be an option. For those who are curious to watch this movie, my advice is only to do it with a group of friends (so you can all point and say "you saw it too") who have been warned about the experience (so nobody gets hurt from the shock), and maybe you can bring a drinking game to ease the pain between the unfortunate laugh. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
