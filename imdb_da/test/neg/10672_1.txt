Ego. Seems this is the only reason this movie was made. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it is under your dignity to write a lot about it. Each character was only good at self-price and main actors (I use this term liberally as the director) emote in the stone's equality. The little story, if so, fails on the basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. obvious errors are everywhere (character motifs are not defined, future husbands are found overnight, broken car windows make way for, among other things) <br /> <br /> Let's see, Himesh can't act. Nor does it seem to be Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she is still a shabby child who looks older than she is thanks to tons of makeup. Raj Babbar takes over and makes his little presence as false as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a little too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural. <br /> <br /> A few questions come to mind: how can such a film cost Rs.500,000,000 ?? where the money was admitted that a chase sequence was moderately well shot, and Mallika Sherawat was paid an indecent Rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute look and 2 songs. but the sheer silence of the film distorts the mind. (including 3 Mumbai auto rickshaws that pop up and jump on a police car) <br /> <br /> The good: Himesh shows courage by letting the movie mock his nasal voice and trademark "topi". Let's give the devil his guilt: Himesh, as usual, gives good music. The Bad: Direction, History, Himesh's song is still hard to ignore. The ugly: Dialogues and everything else !!! Final word: Painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved Subhash Ghai's "Yaadein"
