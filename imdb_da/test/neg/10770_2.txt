I don't know why they kept the name themselves. How they could call the series "The Scarlet Pimpernel" after they rejected the novels so much, I wouldn't have a clue. The sign names are the only things they were kept, and even then they changed a couple of them and mixed them up and changed Percy's relationship with them. Admittedly, I saw only two hours at the most, but it was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing that Baroness Orzcy had portrayed his characters and probably would have rolled around in his grave as it filmed and aerated. Poor lady. I hope that when the next person wants to make a movie / series of the book, they do not destroy it as completely as this series did.
