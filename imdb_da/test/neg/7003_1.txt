It's hard to believe that a movie can be so bad, but you live and learn. What's more, the people who put this thing together are likely to have college degrees. Meanwhile, the fruit of their work has been the outbreak of something that a group of five eight graders may have received. On the bright side (if there is one), the soundtrack has some good moments, which is another reason to question how the rest of the movie can be so damn bad.
