Maybe it was I saw Spider-Man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I don't think there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed as if they had found themselves with a decent throw, they had to try to get them into the movie. The only problem was that they didn't fit. I didn't like any of the characters, and the story was sketchy at best. I wondered why I spent my money on this movie.
