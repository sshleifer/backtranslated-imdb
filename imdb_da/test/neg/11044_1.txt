This film was one of the longest movies that looked at experiences in my life. While I liked how the instructor, Chan-wook Park, handled revenge, traits as a whole were terrible. Oldboy is billed only 1 hour and 55 minutes long, but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I would say that the English dubbing was done very well and the film was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and much of the dialogue repeated. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, avoid hearing Hye-jeong Kang (she's playing Mi-do) speech. If you're looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, look away. If you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, poor dialogue, unnecessary battle scenes, rough torture scenes, and confusing flashbacks, it's not the movie for you.
