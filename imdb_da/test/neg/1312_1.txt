This awful effort just goes to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects, but also let them devise the plot and write the script. Someone has, of course, come up with a new software that asks a few questions and churns out four hours of loosely connected clichÃ©s, miserable dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you end up wishing everyone had drowned in the first five minutes . br /> Tom Courtney took the prize for worst performance. To say he was wood would be an insult to trees. It's hard to fault Robert Carlyle in almost everything he does, but the odds were stacked against himself in this one, especially because for some inexplicable reason he was obliged to adopt an excellent London accent. <br /> <br /> A complete washout.
