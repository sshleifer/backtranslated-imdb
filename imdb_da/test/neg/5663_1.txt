Have you ever been to Youtube? Well, the specific question for that is YES. Can you see boatloads of ICarly and Nickelodeon rants? No particular answer. Many believe that ICarly is a boring and idiotic program, and others believe it is the best program on Earth's surface. I have seen many of the many reviews that panic in the head, and some give it a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for kiddies, but the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> If you did not read the last review, this is the reason 1-8: # 1: Styero types # 2: Goofed-up drama # 3: Everything is stupid (taco truck for example) # 4: Carly thinks she is lovely but she is mediocre # 5: Anyone over the age is stupid # 6: Sam is petit but strong? # 7: No Real Business # 8: Mediators <br /> <br /> # 9: The web show surpasses 3DFX. Just look at the web show to understand what I mean. # 10: Webshow also played personal information. # 11: Almost all famous things are offended. Icarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man to name a few. # 12: There are too many resumes of jokes (Sam's obsession with meat, Freddy's computer, Gibby pulls his shirt away, etc.) # 13: Video game based on the show sucks. # 14: Freddy's lack of masculinity. Why? It becomes unoriginal. # 15: The view is aimed at a female audience. I also hate shows aimed at a male audience, so I prefer that I be for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: Overuse of laughing tracks. <br /> <br /> Part 3 comes in early spring! Just in time for Spring Break!
