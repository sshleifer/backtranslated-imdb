Really awful waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this movie for their conclusion, but had to extinguish it approx. 30 minutes from the end. And I can count the movies I have turned off the end on one side. <br /> <br /> The script and direction are lean and deeply uninspiring. I would not be surprised if they found the manuscript in a pile of 1983 written scripts. I mean seriously. The police would turn their door down in minutes. The scenes and events are washed by you as a turkey in a river. It is difficult to understand the real driving force of the film. The story flicks between characters in a seemingly random way that breaks up the pathetic attempts to build the characters. Oh and what "signs" are they. The main character played by Rourke is horrible. He could just have sent a cardboard cut out of himself and kept in bed. After 60 or so minutes of the movie I had built absolutely zero attachment for this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a creepy dummy from a window that blurs through every scene. His motivation is impossible to distinguish from his generally mumbled and numb delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just the same dead eyes staring at you from an incomplete piece of meat. And the native American theme is just awful and meaningless. <br /> <br /> The good guys are unlikely at best. A dull white collar stereotype and a simmering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun faces the bad guy, "you're not going to shoot me," who is both conductor unoriginal and annoying. The Richie Nix character seems interesting first but soon down into an annoying one-sided psychic character. It seems to be contrary to the apparent intention to make the evil ones somehow sympathetic or at least realistically motivated. <br /> <br /> Roasario Dawson's character begins with some promise, but soon comes down to a pathological and childish parody of gangster chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to think that her character was so attracted to Rourke's? Or worse, is she just a floozy, sleeping with something moving? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /> <br /> In summary, a complete mess in a movie. Solve the characteristics and performances. A leaked and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely boring. Its not even comedy bad either. Scarecrow on Rourke's haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the movie.
