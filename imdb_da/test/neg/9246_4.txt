For broken to be fun, too loose to be interesting and too lumpy to be tolerable MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by really bad filmmaking. As a Ken Russell movie at worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST remade by amateurs, MR LONELY could have been a good idea of ​​a few papers (no script you see) and a free vacation to a place but in the end We have a widescreen movie that seems like it was made by film students whose parents told them that all they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the film maker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) Quirky and deliberately off kilter. It ends up being annoying and indulgent ... and meaningless. What is the point of coming to a municipality in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about Hollywood delusion. Perhaps Korine wanted to re-use GODPELL ... well the result is GOOD-TERRIBLE. Oh, and there's some subplot like remaining footage from FITZCARRALDO, including Werner Herzog, nuns and a plane. Add slo-mo operation and violin music all wild and melancholy, add James Fox, who seems to hope he can be seen as bold (as in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. Filming could have been fun, but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
