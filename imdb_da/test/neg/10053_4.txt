CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the film, it is announced that the bridge collapsed just days after it was taken. The impression is that the attack was far too nothing. In fact, the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the transition to the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge needs only one day after it was captured. This was enough time for Americans to send combat engineers and a great protective force to the other side and they could then start building a number of pontoon bridges. The use of the bridge was a complete success and meant that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer. Contrary to the cynical character of the film, the victory was referred to as elation from the troops who did it. They knew how decisive the battle was. <br /> <br /> This movie has little to do with true story. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time it was produced.
