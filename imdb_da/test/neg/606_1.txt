There is no sign of this sitcom with any redeeming qualities. They are all self-centered, uncomfortable or two-dimensional. My husband looks at it and claims there is nothing else but I would rather not see anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom I can think of was worse was Yes, dear. At least you didn't get 9 seasons. Being overweight is not a comic genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if so, she is wasted on the shrewish wife. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe there's a reason for that. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are emptied.
