The only reason I didn't give this movie a horrible rating is because I feel it was such a horrible movie in every aspect that it deserves at least a 2/10; not to try. <br /> <br /> The reason is the least of your worries as you are faced with the top language and scenes like the "songhole" in a bad attempt at shock and disgust. Seen as the main purpose of this movie is to shock and the main body of it did not accomplish this, the final scene grimly erases the memory of this shockingly pointless movie and fulfills its goal of being the dirtiest movie ever. <br /> <br /> A really low budget movie, terribly acted and the dialogue is shockingly bad. <br /> <br /> I really give it 0/10 !!!
