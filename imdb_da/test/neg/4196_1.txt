A guy, with the unlikely name Shy Walker, is looking for his two daughters in a grain field for an hour and a half. It's the whole plot ... with overall bad action, of course. Walker walks around a corn maze (corn? I get it! HAHAHA ... not fun) and shouts "Girls? Where are you?!?" about 1000 times. For some reason, as he runs off a pumpkin, a chuckling loud voice laughs (as if pumpkins are laughing at him, yes, OK ...). His daughters scream most of the movie ... even when there is no reason to scream (maybe because they are still stuck in this horrible movie?). Twin girls right out of 'The Shining' show up now and then. Most of the maze maze looks the same, so Walker's search becomes very old very quickly. The film authorities realize that there is nothing for this movie (though the music is repetitive) so they try to make things interesting by flipping the camera around very quickly, filming their heads and inserting smaller images of the same shot at different angles using red light to make the maize look scary and rotate the camera 360 degrees (at least I assume these were done on purpose, but they are probably just examples of incompetent film making). More often than not, when Walker walks through the maze, you can't see his face. I think the child holding the camera can't look it high ... This movie gives you a new understanding of the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie, except that it also contains one Cornfield). Don't be fooled by the R rating. Walker says the F-word three times, and now we have a "R-rated horror movie", ugh. The scarecrow on the cover doesn't even appear in this movie ... and when you want the cheesy scarecrows from the first movie to come back, you know things are bad! Instead, we get a guy in yellow boots looking at our all around (unfortunately he's dressed like Mr. Walker, so I didn't even know he was being followed for a while). I figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before Walker did (the movie is almost over when he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the movie pulls on and off ... and just if it is not slow enough, there is a little slow motion! The last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very poor sound dubbing. If you can't tell, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. At least they did not end with the promise of another successor!
