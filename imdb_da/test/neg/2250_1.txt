I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The whole movie was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we did not come up and went out at the first indication of what the movie would really be about (which is still difficult to ascertain as it was such a ridiculous story ... blood, gut, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there would be something redeeming right around the corner. Unfortunately, not because there was nothing that made sense! We went along with a lot of other audiences in the audience who went out of the theater that muttered "it was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "I should have gone out", "where was the comedy" it was pathetic "etc "It made us, in fact, the audience, vote our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. The only thing in the film's confidentiality was the costly and effective ability of almost everyone in the movie .... there just wasn't one plot / script worthy of their talents I rate this a 1 because there is no 0. I cannot quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!
