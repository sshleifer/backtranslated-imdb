I watched for 40 minutes and couldn't hold it anymore? The television went out and I returned to a little light reading "Lobotomy for Beginners". It was hard to say which aspect of this production was most unsatisfactory - the dialogue consisted solely of sound swapping or actor by number. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to determine the period during which drama would take place. There were caste references to Lord Nelson and slavery, but Edmund, the clear-to-be, played by Blake Ritson, was the only actor to believe inhabited in the early 19th century. The other bright young stuff had make-up and costumes more appropriate for a 21st century fancy dress party - the bleached blonde Fanny, Billie Piper is the least credible character. UK Commercial Television clearly believes that heaving chest, pouting lips and deeply meaningful looks make a good story. Fortunately, Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> To find out the story of Mansfield Park, buy the 1983 mini series DVD.
