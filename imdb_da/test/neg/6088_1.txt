First, I just saw a movie on SHOWTIME called Survival Island. It says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane, and when I liked him and couldn't sleep, I thought I'd check it out. So interesting. Looked at it and decided to look at IMDb, who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG, I couldn't believe it, this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie ?? It is played again in 1 hour and 30 minutes on the Showtime Channel again, and this date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time. You can check your showtime listings by title and see it. I don't want to get into the details so you can watch the movie, but at some point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water and takes it all away, you see her naked body ... when she runs back out of the water you see her bottom on. Fun, there are also many other root-ups. I can't believe by chance I decided to watch this movie ... Go figure! Wondering if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studios to put out, but it already plays on Showtime, haha. Good laugh. I give it 1-1 / 2 stars. C, D + film.
