God bless Randy Quaid ... his leachorous cousin Eddie in holiday and Christmas holidays stole the show stylishly. He even made the terrible Vegas Vacation worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I would say he is trying hard in this made for TV sequel, but the script is so not so fun that the movie never really comes anywhere. Quaid and the rest of the recurring holiday vets (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even Europe's vacation Eric Idle can't save the show in a short como .... Pathetic and sad ... actually painful to see .... Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst of the Vacation franchise.
