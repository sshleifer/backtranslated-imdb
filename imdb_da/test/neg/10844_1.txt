This is a strong recommendation for anyone reading this review who has never seen the movie Total Reality, don't waste your time and money hiring this bad excuse for a movie. This is the only worst movie I have ever seen in my life without peer. I had the nightmare of this movie ever since I saw it. The act was horrible, and any amateur movie producer could make a more decent movie. The film softens out of far better sci-fi movies, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to have been derived). I'm sorry, but I just think there is more entertainment value in seeing the side of a cardboard box for two hours. If you've already seen this movie, I feel sorry for going through what I did.
