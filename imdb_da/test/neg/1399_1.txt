This is one of the most ridiculous westerns Hollywood has ever made. Gary Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister', a former confederate officer by law. He meets a moron by the name of Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is an American marshal without knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiance, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tonia's father, has lots of men, but they do not seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly shaken by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, has funded the loan on Robles property, making things completely absurd. He even has the power to claim mortgage payments before they are due simply because he feels it. <br /> <br /> When Weatherby is a Boston boy who can't fight when he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee, Tonia, (just another instance of more plot nonsense. That you only have to pass a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy couldn't pass the written test either.) He changes identities with Reb Hollister, who is, of course, an expert pistol. Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's number one stud, is in good shape here as Reb. Before the movie is finished, he not only takes Weatherby's job, he also steals his fiance, and Ruth Roman as Tonia falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives Chump Leif Erickson the brush before the movies over half over. <br /> <br /> There's not a piece of plot credibility in the whole movie, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the movie is a dud. And Cooper's character is a complete heel to start. The movie also stares Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who unfortunately turned away from her chances by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I strongly suggest that you pass this one up.
