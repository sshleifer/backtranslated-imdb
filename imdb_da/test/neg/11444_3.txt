This movie has it all: it is a thriller, a chase movie, a novel story, a mob story, a comedy, a road movie ... yes, it is nothing at all. <br /> <br /> All the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you still see the same boring, uninspiring and superficial clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even star cast plays lack credibility. A hit man with his quirks, a girl who plays hard to get, mob people that seem hard and inappropriate police, yawns ... I would recommend not to see Backtrack. If you want to watch a good movie directed by a famous actor, go and see 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada' by Tommy Lee Jones. Now that's what I call worth seeing.
