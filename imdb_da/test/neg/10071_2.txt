Do people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? Not a moment of it is worth it. Many items could easily scare people out of the movies ... and it's not dinos! Tea Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strung a vocal chord while filming the movie .... Laura Dern ... she's okay, but why not be more visible in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard of something called facial expressions? Fools, emotions ..." .. he has to work harder on it! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack ... needs to change that record or you get tired of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor whom I have never seen playing a bad role .... unfortunately he cannot save the movie, nor the well-computer-created dinosaurs.
