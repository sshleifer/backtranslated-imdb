Calling this a Sunday school movie can be generous, because even as a Christian I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I would not see it in my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you will not be left behind by rapture." There was no love. I think when you come right down to it, I don't believe in the god portrayed in this movie. The guy who was supposed to have all the spiritual answers came across as Count Dracula. <br /> <br /> Apart from the spiritual / religious element, the script was boring - saying the same thing over and over. It might have been to make up for some of the actors who couldn't deliver a compelling line for the first time, so they said the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the final scenes. I thought it made a point without hitting anyone over the head or bowing to a Sunday school formula. The movie wasn't that bad, just most of the time. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of more pure films that are well-finished and the present truth in a non-preaching way. This was not one of them I am sorry to say. I took my family to this movie and wanted to support that kind of movie. Now I want my money back.
