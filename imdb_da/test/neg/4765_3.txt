Bob Clampett's 'The Hep Cat' is a distinctly average cartoon that is really remarkable only because it was the first color of Looney Tune (formerly Looney Tunes were all black and white, while Merrie Melodies was in color). The story of a song dancer's attempt to awaken a cat and a dog's attempt to catch the cat, 'The Hep Cat' lacks the brand energy and pace of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett doesn't have much to do with. Warren Foster's scripts are embarrassingly thin, and even though he has spun straw in gold with other cartoons, Clampett does not cope with 'The Hep Cat'. It's often said about Clampett that you can't celebrate their cartoons for others, and it's generally true, but 'The Hep Cat' is an exception. There are flashes of Clampett genius, which chase scene where the cat stops asking the dog "Hey, are you following me". When the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says "Oh," and the hunt resumes immediately. Unfortunately, there is very little such brilliance on show here. Knowing who instructed it, 'The Hep Cat' is a bitter disappointment. We have every day, and it was clearly one of Clampett's!
