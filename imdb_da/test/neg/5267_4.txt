I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It had all the ingredients in a large tongue in the cheek, but it just didn't come together at all. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable, except he sometimes forgot to use it, and I'd rather not have listened to Linda Fiorentino's pale trials. She and Helen Baxendale were completely lacking in charm and personality, luckily having their screen kids loads so you could find at least some members of his 2 families who were loving. You could have tense spaghetti with the plot, and I'm sure the manuscript was written by a youth school girl in an English school college. Having said that, since I was not calling, I was smirking, so it wasn't a totally wasted 90 minutes. I found overlaying Kevin's face on the painting very wise and quite fun. Maybe I'm a little tough, but I expected a bit of quality show, and it just never came.
