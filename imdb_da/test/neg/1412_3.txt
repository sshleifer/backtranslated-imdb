I went to watch this movie, mostly because it looked so good in trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should have greatness. Instead, it just continues Williams' bad strike of film last. What's wrong with the movie? More as it is right: The ensemble crew does a good job about Robin, and as usual Christopher Walken is fantastic. That said, this movie was simply not good. I really only recommend seeing it if you want to see how it would be if Jon Stewart ran for president and won. Saying that he won is not a spoiler when it was in the trailer. The concept and idea are really entertaining, but it is all. Most of Robin's jokes have just been reused from old comedy pieces of his, and very few are laughing loudly, and most are just stupid. Like most comedies that turn out to suck, all the fun pieces are put in the trailer. Really no surprises there, but come on! Some of the movie reads like a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn novel! People expect this to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more of a Flubber.
