What crack do you smoke? This movie, while brilliant entertaining, is horrible! <br /> <br /> Of course, the action scenes are fake, it's a little sad. The Colonel's daughter is painfully annoying. Ninja training camp is so much fun, it's almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and turns up the other army guy, I'm just driving myself. I could continue ... <br /> <br /> Entertaining, no doubt. Well, no. Well made, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a comment to America as an empire, it's actually pretty good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not all that surprising, especially in the case of American movies from the mid-1980s.
