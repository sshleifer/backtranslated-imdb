this movie has no plot, no good acting, to be honest it has nothing, the same songs play over and over horrible plays and if you can actually sit there and see it all and enjoy it, there is something wrong with you. I wish I could give this 0 out of 10, but I can't so it should be a 1 that is generous! is-t is not even a good rapper and even worse at acting, every bit of the movie is bad, i have this movie on dvd without knowing what it was for the price of Â£ 1.99 and thought i had bought a good buy, then I looked at the IMDb rating and did not take it into consideration, but after seeing it found out that the DVD I had purchased was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this movie there are two things you can sell it to someone who doesn't know it or burn it!
