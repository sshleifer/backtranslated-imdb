I swear I didn't believe that! I only picked this out as it looked good on the back! This movie was not scary at all and was actually very confusing. The demon wind was only used a few times and people were killed by beautiful cheesily. One big bright spot was watching Sherri Bendorf from the slaughterhouse play in it. See what happened to her, but made my opinion for this little turkey of a movie. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!
