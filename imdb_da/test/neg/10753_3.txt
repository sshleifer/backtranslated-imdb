I found this movie completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew some of his facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and enigmatic. The pictures were curiously interesting, but I was looking for a biographical and / or critical account of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD-type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumped back and forth in time through the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes were extremely distracting. Had it been labeled an "artistic movie", I would not have bought the DVD; Now I have a DVD that I will never see again and who will buy it? I prefer ordinary movies, not those that require translation or lighting. Thumbs down on this for me!
