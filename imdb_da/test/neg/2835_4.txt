A young doctor and his wife suddenly expect a child. Both are disturbed by a two-hour memory decay at night for fertilization. Interesting twist on a hackneyed story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in a cast featuring Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normalcy to outlandish. Kudos to Director Brian Yuzna.
