I've seen this movie, having seen the original "Spoorloos" a few times in anticipation of the cool end. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to explain the anger and disappointment I experienced when the end came and went and the movie continued with a good ending. What a waste of time it was to see this American remake ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, skip the "The Vanishing" and see the Dutch original "Spoorloos". The excitement is very well built. You feel Rex's frustration, to find traces of what might have happened to her boyfriend Saskia after she entered a gas station and never returned to her car. The search takes him three years, and when he finally comes in contact with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must accept to go through the same thing that Saskia has gone through. The end leaves you speechless in your chair.
