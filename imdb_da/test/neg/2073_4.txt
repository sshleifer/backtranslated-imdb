Sad play, weak script ... worst Spanish film this year ... I was <br /> <br /> attracted to Paz Vega's (naked) beauty, but as an actress <br /> <br /> she is useless, you can hardly understand what she says ... About the story there is not much coherence to say ... we heard about it <br /> <br /> before, but as This is a "modern Carmen" we find A few changes: -The French soldier is now a Basque soldier. -Merimee itself is a sign in history. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous <br /> <br /> "matador" and she can speak fluent Basque ... Can anyone understand this mess?
