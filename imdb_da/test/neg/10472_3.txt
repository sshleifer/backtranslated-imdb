In Sweet Water, the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) builds a resort in the middle of the desert during the protest of the Katona people. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch on the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton known as the Bone Eater, and their bones are consumed by the monster. The half racer Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is responsible for investigating the disappearance of workers, pushed by Krantz to arrest the protesters. Bone Eater attacks and kills other locals while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) seeks an old Tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature. <br /> <br /> "Bone Eater" is a lame and silly movie with one of the most ridiculous manuscripts I've ever seen. The signs and the situation are not well developed and things happen without further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worse part of this flick, with the typical white North American Bruce Boxleitner dressed as an Indian (in his story his grandfather was Indian), carved his own wrist (why? And where's the blood later?) And lumped the ax in Bone Eater chest, destroy the monster and my last hope of any improvement in history. My last question: If the bone sore eats bones, what happens to his victims' meat and clothing? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("Bone Eater")
