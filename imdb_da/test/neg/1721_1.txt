Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. My lifetime was drastically wasted by this stack of stink. I'd rather chew from my arm than watch this movie again. Painful story line, painful signs and painful two hours. The best way to describe this movie is: - I'd rather stick in my eyes and cut out my brain than see a second minute of This tripe. Counseling is to stay clear and let your local dustman benefit you to remove this nonsense. Linen, you told me it was good !!! ! <br /> <br /> Goodaleebyeload.
