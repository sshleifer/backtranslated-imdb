First of all, Blythe Danner does not see anywhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she is not - just ten years apart). I understand this must be one of those magical, Moonstruck-type supernatural romances, but this is beyond the pale. Very, very weak in terms of action, script and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this movie appear - if not really credible even as she is cast as a piece of a heterosexual sexhound. But endearing anyway. In fact, DeGeneres and the young guy from Capshaw make dallies together to make this happen. But no one can really know if Capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; Neither the script nor her play draws it together for us, and we are left wondering how she really feels.
