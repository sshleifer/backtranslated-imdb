The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of the war, human cyborgs, battles, history and then dumps two actors into a gravel pit. They run around this gravel pit / desert area for about an hour shooting at each other. That is it. Must have cost about Â£ 10.00 to make, with change. Avoid. Marks out of ten: Action -9 Set 1 Costumes -9 Direction -50 Production 1 Title intro 4 <br /> <br /> I think improving this movie would be to: Lose the comment. (Let the viewer decide what happens). Remove some of the horrible CGIs. Add some techno rave music to it. They can just save it .......
