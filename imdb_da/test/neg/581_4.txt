"May contain spoilers" Unfortunately, Lou Costello's latest film has the distinction of being a little better than Abbott & Costello's last movie "Dance With Me Henry". This movie is not at all horrible, it's an entertaining career error. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie a little tolerable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because a big study released it, which meant someone had to give it the "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello was having trouble losing his son some years earlier and the unjustified IRS attacks. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies, you can see that the magic was gone. Check out "Dance with me Henry" now it's a painful movie to watch.
