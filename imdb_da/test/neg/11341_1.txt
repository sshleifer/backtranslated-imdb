Racing enthusiast Fabian (like Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks and suffers from blackouts while juggling emotions for amazing brunette Annette Funicello (like Francie Madsen) and blonde star Diane McBain (like Annie Blaine). Complicating cases are Ms Funicello's cheeky race girlfriend Warren Berlinger (like Eddie Sands) and her father Jan Murray (like Pete Madsen) who encourage ruthless drivers. Funicello's cow-eye performance is sometimes enjoyable; But her drunk driving scene is unnerving. "Thunder Alley" gives marginally more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it's not much. A wild party scene with some mild stripe battle is the low point of the movie.
