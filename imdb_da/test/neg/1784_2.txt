If this film was made two years earlier, it could have been much better. But unfortunately it was made in the decade that had no idea how a horror movie should look or act. When I first heard about this movie, people on IMDb classified it as the sequel to Cheerleader Camp. Oh, how wrong were they? Yes, Betsy Russell was in it, but Uma Thurman was definitely not. I really want to find the person who started the entire successor rumor. I'm sure many of us would. I don't want to give anything away because I honestly can't remember how this movie even ends! I just want to tell you to see a real camp horror movie ... The Burning Starring Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter, and the Nerd from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High. A word to the wise - Just because a horror movie has a glossary in the title, doesn't mean it's worth seeing. Oh, and another thing, WHEN HORROR'S FLICK WELL IN EARLY FOR THE MIDDLE 90'S WILL BE RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLY NOTE!
