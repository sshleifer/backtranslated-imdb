Very resilient but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic, containing an animated part in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very prominent - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast (a 69-year-old Mason as the twentieth chimney sweep!) To the inappropriate (Greenwood as an amazing aristocrat) to the bizarre (Whitelaw plays several "exotic" characters - including a circus artist, an old hag, a girl and a fairy - without apparent reason). The animated segment of movies handled by a group of Eastern European animators is hardly inspired, but mildly enjoyable in itself and, as usual with this type of thing, there is an assortment of songs to be coped with, one of which is especially reprized too often for his own good. The film was directed by the featured actor Jeffries, who had previously directed (much more successful) other children's films, namely THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and THE AMAZING MR. BLUND (1972, which I have not yet seen for myself, but some time ago was released on R2 DVD by Anchor Bay UK).
