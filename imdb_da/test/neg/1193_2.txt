I'm a massive fan of LoG. I thought the first two series delivered some of the best comedies the country has ever seen, and the third series, although different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The idea of ​​seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen made July 3 something to wait for. Yet another place went terribly wrong. The authors had no history and no real ideas. The part that was put in the old England showed the brilliance that we know the League is capable of, but these scenes did not fit well with the film. Geoff made the most of too few, almost bad jokes, and Lipp and Briss's performances were big worries. If you love the League, save time and money and watch episodes from the TV series again. And again. A massive disappointment.
