I saw this movie and I thought it was a stupid movie. What's even more stupid is who thought an idea of ​​a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is, there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be recorded in Los Angeles, it will be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes, which is a fact that this film is to be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the right idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, it's incredibly foggy and very stupid. In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but rubbish.
