I continued to wait for this movie to improve, but it is still the worst kind of escapist movie: a spun sugar confection sinking under the weight of its own bad self-meaning. The pace stumbled like a legionary stranded in the Sahara. The absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with a little to do other than look good in white linen. Irons play another moneyed charmer who has had a touch of the sun. Cheese is a pleasant singer, but not much of an actress. Fortunately, the script does not often encourage her to emote away from the jazz club microphone. All the enviably relaxed, beautiful, unnecessary characters are shifting to mastering the scene with an air of tired affinance. The whole exercise comes across as an immensely long Ralph Lauren ad. <br /> <br /> If you are past forty and believe Francophilia is the key to sophistication, you may be mistaken in this piece of carduette cardboard. Well, if you liked this movie, you probably felt smart to appreciate Godard's lead Ã‰loge de l'amour, and you might even have put yourself through Le Divorce without cutting.
