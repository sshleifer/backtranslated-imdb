Rs.30 / - is all I paid as rent to the DVD in the movie and believe me it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood directors think it's fun to show fools? That's not good. Let yourself grow up. <br /> <br /> Here is a dialogue from the movie "TAGEN LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TOMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI". <br /> <br /> The reason is useless, criminals and police ran after fools. That is it. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well, the title lived, I had to run away from it. :) I switched over to Star Movies and looked at Home Alone 2 instead and had a good laugh.
