I can't believe they even released such a movie. The only good play came from the water in the movie. This should be one of the worst (if not the worst) movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of the movie is the bad play I give this movie a 1 is me to be friendly, this movie deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> The story and if You can call it the movie of the movie, seems to be written by a high school kid. Ofcaurse you have to ask yourself if it might have been better with better players in it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait for it to appear on TV. <br /> <br /> AND EVEN SEE IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.
