There are lots of ketchups but not a lot of reason in the supposedly explanatory third successor that bunches on the naff images without effect. Good old Alan Smithee instructed this where various members of the same family (all played, bad, by Bruce Ramsay) were terrorized by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, rolled out by mothballs in the seventh time). Peter Atkins tries to deepen his script with poetic details, but does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a sick leave. The incoherent plot fails to fill the film's poor maturity adequately, although it may have more to do with studio interference than the filmmakers intended.
