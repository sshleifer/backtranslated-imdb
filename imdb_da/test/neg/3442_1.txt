Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict. He is a sweeping and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person. The only movie with him in what is fun is "Galaxy Quest" and that's just because his character - a blessed actor from a previous hit TV show - was so close to real life for him. The rest of the molding is just as bad. I HATE the mom and the actress who played her Patricia Richardson, she sucks! The whole cliché is there, the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares for her children, while in fact she proclaims family values ​​and gets divorced by twins. And the child's actors were as interesting as a root canal.
