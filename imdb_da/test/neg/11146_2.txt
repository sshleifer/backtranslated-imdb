This movie sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. If the devil is invincible, why does he require protection of the arnier bodyguards? I couldn't understand why arnie didn't come up for work for days and then suddenly appear, take all their arsenal and disappear again !! Good work if you can get it. It is sad that the last 1/2 hour must result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' final. Arnie's interpretation of a depressed policeman is to bend his head and sniff. I thought he had a bad cold for most of the movie. Terribly written, Arnie is called "mate", "guy" etc. For 95% of the film, and then suddenly we hear that he is called by his real name Jericho Cane (where do they get these names from?). The end is so two, you can better get the barf bag ready. Shame that Gladiator pulled the same end with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
