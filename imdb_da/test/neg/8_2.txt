I'm not a big fan of musicals, though technically it can't qualify as a musical. But I thought I'd give it a try when I love war movies. It was mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Hudson works out of kilts in this role. It just didn't work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as well as she could, but I just find it hard to buy her as an insidious, fraudulent spy. Sorry, I know it's classic stereotypes on my part. But I have to say that I think this is Julie's most beautiful and feminine look. I always thought of her as more matronic, but then it's probably the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. There was no doubt that they desperately tried to get her out of the typecasting in this role. She was quite insulting in appearance, but I still didn't buy her as a spy. I couldn't keep my focus throughout the movie and found myself tune in and out - and have conversations with them in my room (which I usually never do - I always push everyone). So it tells you how little it was my attention. Do not waste your time!
