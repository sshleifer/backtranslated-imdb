A bad movie about a bad movie. Is it original or what? If it is, then it is the only good thing about it. The lovely Ally Sheedy couldn't stop this bomb from destroying cinemas and video recorders anywhere. It should also be noted that she and the other actors employed by Danny Aiello's character were billed as themselves, as well as the characters they played in his D-rated movie. Calling it a B-rated movie, is too much of a compliment, and would lead to delusions.
