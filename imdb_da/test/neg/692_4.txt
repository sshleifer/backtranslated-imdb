* POSSIBLE SPOILS BASED * <br /> <br /> I will only say what has not already been said here (and I continue this for the rest of my WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you want a Women's title fight, at least make it interesting, rather than just a squash to put over the current champion. I think Moolah couldn't handle an intense battle, but they wanted to have the game in a WrestleMania. I thought the murder beer was wasted in WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair was gone, and Jim Brunzell left a canvas. So I didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team, even top contenders. <br /> <br /> But I loved watching Bill Fralic in the royal royal. He really got into his own here, created a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even made an elimination in the royal royal battle. Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete from my generation with respect to wrestling (someone remembers Dennis Rodman?). And what about the Hart Foundation's ridiculous green tights?
