I was pretty much lost in most of this movie, and I'm the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema caves as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork doesn't make sense at some level, it just doesn't combine to form a completely coherent movie. As time goes on to watch the movie, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my first viewing I was really confused and I find this to be the biggest mistake in the movie ... its lack of direction. The site is centered on the city of Northfork, Montana in the year 1955. The city is empty and will soon be flooded to create room for the creation of a water dam. The biggest problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and moved. A group of men are hired to force the remaining residents out of the city before it is drowned, and mostly they succeed in some rather strange situations and townspeople. At the same time, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very ill young boy (or is he a fallen angel?), If adopted parents gave him back to Northfork's orphanage because of his illness. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) cares for the dying Irwin, but Irwin (or does he?!) Imagine that a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have arrived in the deserted and empty city looking for a fall angel. Irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where people amputated their wings and halo. Oh yes, and under all this, there is a strange surrealistic goose on stilts that stretches over the background of the landscape. There are many other small events happening in the movie, but none of them make much more than instant intrigue. One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is obvious that the filmmakers have taken a great deal on this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and falls to an end without doing much of an announcement. As I wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, far after seeing what may have happened in the movie. Irwin is dying and it is also Northfork, and to cope with his own loss and death, Irwin has probably created signs, from ideas he gets from the objects surrounding him in the orphanage, to console him when he is abandoned and his life is nearing its end. But then again, maybe he's really an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home. I must emphasize that there are some really beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vibrant and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole stops feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.
