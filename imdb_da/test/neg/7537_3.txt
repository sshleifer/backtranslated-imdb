Two teenagers in the North East of England are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "comic misadventures", but come up with smiling smile at last. <br /> <br /> The trailer for this movie sells it as a comedy and contains most of its merry moments. However, the tone is increasingly gloomy, and the end result is a depressing story of known stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no trouble lying, cheating and stealing. Their opponents are a boring teacher, a pantomime villain of a father, a psychotic skinhead and a well-meaning but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are an abused teenager, a pregnant schoolgirl, and a battered wife who seems to be smoking to death. There are no sympathetic signs, and the audience can only feel compassion or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley both play against the type of evil, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they no more than novelty. Chris Beattie and Greg McLane are performing well in the two young leaders. But they are miscast because they have the wrong accent. For anyone from the north east, it is obvious that they both come from the Sunderland / Durham area, and yet we are expected to believe that they are native to Newcastle. As a Geordie myself, I can assure you that the accents are by no means the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy speak". We say "Let the poo song speek" while they say "piwer let spiyk", with two distinctly different vocal sounds. This disagreement creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in Sunderland's football field, where the two boys try to pamper the Newcastle accents they don't have, and * pretend to come from Sunderland - which they clearly do. In a mild comedy, this kind of criticism can be seen as nit-picking. However, the film's gloomy tone makes it clear that the author / director Mark Herman is aiming for gritty realism: it means "near enough" is actually far away. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for humor and optimism from this movie, and instead found tired old clich√©s. Tyneside is not a green waste solely of losers, and by telling us that is, Herman should have known that he would cause misdemeanor. It is interesting to compare the movie with the same director "Little Voice" - also largely downbeat and populated by one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice" has at least a talented heroine and does not dwindle in misery to the same extent. I've heard "Belts" ranked alongside this year's "Billy Elliot", but that movie is a much more enjoyable and life-conscious experience. By the way, I might just be too old, but have lived at Tyneside for 42 years I have never heard anyone outside this movie use the term "Purely Belter".
