If you loved the early 60's version of "Time Machine", don't waste your time; as with last year's "Apes Planet", this has been "reimagined" and not for the better. And as with "Planet ..." its main actor is violently overlooked and read; Guy Pearce, a great actor of great reach, is all wrong for this role, giving a one-tone performance that causes zero sympathy; He is so sour and serious and lacks in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees you do not believe in an instant that he is experiencing them. Even worse, whose idea was for him to look like the love child of David Spade and Calista Flockhart ?? A beautiful actor, here he is sickly, which is, believe it or not, a great distraction. Frankly, the man looks seriously ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is not synchronized with that of others. Unfortunately, even with a proper lead man, this movie does not stand the chance of being badly burdened by both a completely incomplete director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a manuscript that is totally inferior, scattered and sometimes disjointed - not for a moment do you worry about anyone in this movie, for the only fact that there is nothing in the way of character development! In the original you were told Eloi, so you felt for them and felt their fright of Morelocks; Here, as the movie is stressing several times, they are only sheep and act accordingly. Unless you are a member of PETA, frightened get hard for entertainment! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does as well as possible in her movie debut, but like everyone else in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of Morelocks [who resembles denials from "The Mummy Returns"], why Does he look like Edgar Winters lost brother?) Is the waste completely. Also wasted, the money was spent on the endless "special" effects that believed the $ 70 million spent on the movie; they are uniformly deficient, obvious and convincing. And then there is the film's appearance: poorly photographed, its artistic direction and set are just "there" and its costumes are typical in design. There is no original mindset or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Most of all, it's not even fun! (The film authorities use the now ubiquitous Orlando Jones as "comic relief", but normally Jones is annoying and just WHERE does his electrically driven character in a world survive apparently devoid of electricity?) <br /> <br /> All in all This is an empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused affair. Haven't they ever recorded "Planet of the Apes" ??? (At least it was good luck with some strong performances!) * SPOILER! * The final insult (in addition to a headache terribly, not to mention practical and quit)? Not only do the BARELY have the changing dress store figures, they even make the time machine even an anachronistic, shiny glass-n-chrome bore! (If the "Sopranos" had a time machine, that's exactly how it looks.) Pathetic ...
