Director / screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's 1939 MGM classic comedy shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 playing on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, history will seem the rage of a modern remake. Instead, the production is because of English thematic overreach across as an extended therapy session with a fatness. In addition, the diverse lifestyle of women today has been reduced to stereotypes at the sitcom level in this film, and the original game's central notion of removing men from history seems even more confused because of the open panxual development that has arisen among men as well as women since the 1930s. To add disgrace to injury, the recent big screen customization of HBO's "Sex and the City" made this kind of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper catches. The skeleton of the original game remains as the story centered on wealthy Mary Haines, who abandoned his promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like "Sex and the City" she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful editor in Miranda Priestly magazine "The Devil Wears Prada" (another movie, this echo); eternally pregnant Edie Cohen, representing the residence wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian writer who seems to represent any repressed group, is generally excluded from such an exclusive click. Through an oral manicurist, they find out that Maria's husband has an affair with male Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter as it becomes a series of scenes that focus on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very luminous and without the satirical zing that bent the 1939 movie. <br /> <br /> Looking strangely youthful at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a way that tries to revive the goodwill she created in the 1990s with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle ". It is not that she is not aged here, but her familiar frailty works in contrast to the character's passive character. Annette Bening is doing something better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role in Sylvie, because she has proven herself capable of conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a transformation that it seriously undermines the performance of the actors. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a low, transparent shopwoman versus the clever, hard-cut cookie Joan Crawford has to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sideline as Edie and Alex respectively. Much better is Candice Bergen as Maria's miss, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nude housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The noisy box office response to the movie's release probably reflects the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls at night as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party and the other an extension of Bette Midler's comeback as a multi-married Hollywood agent who advises Mary late on Evening at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round the extras "" The Women: The Legacy "about the story behind the movie from the original 1936 game and" The Women Behind the Women ", which has cast and crew, speaks infinitely about female self-movement and self-image. that this version of "The Women" directed and written by a woman takes such a condescending look at women.
