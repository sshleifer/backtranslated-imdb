I just fill out this comment because I couldn't claim that a positive comment was highlighted on the "complete information" page. I really think this is the worst movie ever made in my country. This is not only because of the horrible plot, the crazy English and a tension curve that is as flat as our country. No, this is because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, in line with the Hollywood standard. It was supposed to be "European Action Film of the Year". For this purpose, they even hired Fejda van Huet, actor in the academic award-winning image "Character", to do the job. I don't mind bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they are pretentious books. but I can't hold movies that are terrible but should be a-type movies.
