This is a very stupid work on miscasting - just as bad as Hepburn plays a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The main Hepburn player is a combination of Granny from Beverly Hillbillies and a trohelder! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play a hillbilly - he was just surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds like it comes straight from a Li'l Abner strip! The problems do not really end with the monstrous casting, as the plot is completely confused and the "love story" can damage your head. Without reason why Robert Young married this Ozark bobcat. Was it her lovely personality that won his heart? I doubt when she was named after the burning "spitfire" movie, and she really liked to fight and scrappin 'and hollerin'! Was it her feminine charm? Without makeup and fashion that looked like those designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt whether that was the case either. On top of that, Ralph Bellamy joined her to some extent, though it doesn't yet seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> So here we have two boyfriends fallen 'for a creepy unfeminine she-beast played by Mrs Hepburn - now it's a recipe for a good movie!
