"Thomas Crown Affair" is a horrible remake of a not very good movie that can only be redeemed for the topless shootings of former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan called in his part, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish policeman, but I couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful Ms Russo. There is an ok love scene on a staircase, a fantastic sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene and a roll in the bag. Oh, and there is a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran being immersed. <br /> <br /> Let us hope, however, that other directors recognize Mrs Russo's perky attributes and cast her into several highly visible roles.
