Seriously I thought it was a spear when I saw it at the rental shop, but I realized that it was just rubbish, I can't even believe I didn't close it, as we all know the snakes were not rattlers, they were pythons and Gardner is the actress lame and caring i still can't believe the final loll if you want to see it just watch it to the end, it was seriously priceless way better than the 6th sense, i don't even know if the film's makers actually thought this title would fly, the only time it really was going to fly is when I throw it in the garbage ... just watch it for a laugh it was fun in the stupid way, BUY NOT BED.
