I never thought about watching this movie. I continued to watch it on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental store and never thought much about it. Just your run of the mill, gentle zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene. Nothing special can just as well see Python ... Oh no wait, it's a horrible movie. I only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on TV and said it was a terrible piece of the trash. So I decided to confirm these stories and only then did I understand how horrible the movie is behind the boring and uninteresting DVD box cover. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea is bad in itself. An aircraft is a limited area, and it would be a real death trap for people on board whose zombies should appear ... a prerequisite for a zombie movie. But this movie took a good attitude and fought over it with malfunctioning, unstable camera work, annoying characters and a horrible score. The people all have different levels of hatred. There are two young couples who are basically friends on holiday in France. A couple consists of a jock and his annoying bitchy boyfriend who has an affair with Mr Jock's best friend who came with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho. There is also a policeman escorting a king (a uniform and highly annoying king). The policeman is probably one of the least annoying characters in the party. Then there is a bunch of airplanes that mostly end up as zombiechow ... no I didn't look at the whole movie, it was just too painful to experience, almost as bad as looking at the cannibal holocaust. Oh, and there's also a golfer on vacation with his wife, a weird air march that doesn't really seem to be important until he is called to help handle the zombie flights, a trio of scientists who all fall victim to. undead and a few pilots. The camera's work is often shaken, and although many people do not think about it, it can really get on your nerves after a while, like having a little flycatcher all the time around your head. It's small, but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The amazing couple are really annoying. All they do is have sex in the plane's toilets while their spouses are not looking ... in fact, all the young adults in this movie are insanely annoying. They gnaw, bitch, argue and have some of the most inane and insane boring dialogue in the movie ... yes it makes you happy to see them die. The result is terrible. It's so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of excitement, a scene could have generated and replaced it with the feeling that someone is scratching a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. In fact, it sounds like the score from ... Python! That movie will never stop spewing me. <br /> <br /> There is also a sign that the filmmakers seemed to be incredibly helpful in having as many pictures as possible. A nun sitting near the young adults attaching his Bible, which is included in so many shots, begins to wonder if she plays a big part in the movie ... but no she doesn't So why does she have so many scenes? Was it because the film's original project was a non-porn flick? No one will ever know. <br /> <br /> The zombies look great. Their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters, they are far more convincing and comfortable! The guard responsible for keeping an eye on the scientists' illegal cargo was quite fun. A big box seems to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his legs have been pierced with some kind of sharp object ... yet he doesn't scream, topple or groan in pain. He laughs and laughs just in an attempt to get something out of his leg ... in fact, he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain. All in all, I give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies. Just watch this movie if you like young adults who bitter and throw things at each other, and unfortunately there is really nothing fun about it all, so looking at a laugh would probably fail unless you are high on some kind psychoactive substance.
