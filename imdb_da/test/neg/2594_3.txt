Family guy. When the show first aired, it was fresh, original and actually quite fun. Now I have stopped seeing it. It has become one of the worst performances on television, combining involuntary jokes, repetitive, drawn jokes and the hope that every joke can be fun with the inclusion of the word "bitch". Seth Macfarlane obviously has problems with herself and he is apparently pandering to the 13 year old boys audience. I just don't understand how something that started so much fun, so different from everything else, can include in this horrible mess on a "comedy" show. I have seriously heard a liners from a pud cartoon. It is really sad to see good shows fail, and see how to do this continue. Either Seth Macfarlane has stopped trying, or he thinks this show is fun as it is. <br /> <br /> Whatever, God helps us. <br /> <br /> I hate this show and will dance an Irish jig when finally canceled.
