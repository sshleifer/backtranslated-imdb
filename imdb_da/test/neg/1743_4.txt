Some Janapese modern horror films are very good. Strong plot, scary moments, good acting, while others are just ... Unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to the last camp. <br /> <br /> I will judge the movie based on 3 elements: Plot, Scary Factor and Acting. <br /> <br /> 1) Plot - true to the name movie, the plot moves in circle and never really explains itself. OK, the city is imprisoned by the spiral path, but why? And why do people seem so stupid? There is a fleeting attempt to explain what is happening to the reporter ... unfortunately ... 2) Scary factor - if this was supposed to be a horror-flick, it has failed miserably. I can't really remember a good scary scene with lots of building it up. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting - very monotonous. People walk around and say meaningless phases. I can't really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes. All in all, there are much better modern Japanese horror films out there with a coherent plot and strong characterization. Don't waste your time on this wannabe.
