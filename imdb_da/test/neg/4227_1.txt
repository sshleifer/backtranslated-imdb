Although this movie has a slow, dreamlike, almost fascinating pace and an interesting, but not completely precise, description of a rural French constable's criminal investigative practice and staff, I find it ultimately impossible to recommend. I think this movie is simply a set piece to promote a person's - director's, assuming a disgust for heterosexuality. Surely, human sexuality in all its forms can have their outrageous moments without denying it! But choosing the bad uniform at the expense of the good that this movie does at every turn suggests a combed sensibility in the workplace. In short, if you enjoy watching homosexuality as masking as compassion, and the depiction of heterosexual love and the female form in a fierce and degrading light - then this movie is for you. I don't, and it wasn't.
