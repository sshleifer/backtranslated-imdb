George Zucco was a fine actor who often plays gimlet-eyed villains with a huge intensity. But even he couldn't save this boring and flat-footed B flip. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays the usual mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that the wolf's blood injected into humans can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win World War II (go figure!) Experiencing Pedro handyman (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf similar to those used by Dave Allen to play in his comedy sketches! Of course, Pedro is based on Lennie from Of Mouse and Men, and you almost expect him to say "Duh, okay, George!" There is a striking moment when the wolf kill a child by entering through the window and grabbing it, but it is mostly routine and pedestrian - very pedestrian - 77 minutes passes through all the old clich√©s made much better in other movies .We also get revenge from Devil Bat's work, in itself a loan from Son Of Frankenstein! <br /> <br /> Zucco is wasted and you only have to watch him in movies like Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault's Secret to see where wasted. A few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer, really. And the scene where Zucco demonstrates his wolf's technique to those who doubted him (again shades of Dr. Jekyll and Hyde) is unintentionally fun. <br /> <br /> Not one of the better 40s B movies.
