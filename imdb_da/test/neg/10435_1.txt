The action made you feel like you were looking at a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and holes and jumps around so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the scenes are meaningless. There is no skewed character development. The score / soundtrack consists of about three songs, which are especially played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie, but I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances. It seems that the bulk of the budget was used to put some names into players in this less-than-bad movie. This movie is like visiting a strip club, trying to get you excited and interested, but just as you think something is going to happen, you are thrown into an independent scene and trying to figure out how to arrive there.
