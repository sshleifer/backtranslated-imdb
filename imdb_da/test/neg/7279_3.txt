This movie was recommended to me by several people and after reading all the positive comments from this site I went ahead and bought a copy of the movie from ebay. The action in the movie is average and a little hammy, especially of the cannabis family, a sequence comes to mind when Jupiter breeds and raises to the burnt corpse, and speaks right into the camera. Its one of the shows where you just crawl and feel bad for the bad actor. It is also a sign of some of the worst editions I've seen, there is a horrible jump right in the middle of his "speech". However, there are some creepy moments, and at times the music works well ... but generally the movie is not that big and I don't know why people think Wes Craven is so big of a director. So far he has not shown me anything that I believe to be brilliant, the only thing that improved with Cravens movies, production for prodution was his budget.
