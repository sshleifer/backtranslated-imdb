This is a very bad movie. However, I read that it was made by a high school teacher, so maybe I should give it at least a little bit of praise for it's ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's the plot: A monster emerges from a pile of waste and pollution in the city of Milpitas, California and begins on a destructive rampage. I am about to spoil the "big surprise" about what the monster looks like, so please read the rest of this at your own risk. You've been warned! The monster looks like a giant, two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. The action is horrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The reason is predictable. Stay away!
