A completely pathetic attempt at film about victims of Australian soldiers during the New Guinea campaign. Total waste of money, even if you only watch it on DVD. Fortunately, the video store provided a free weekly rental with the DVD, otherwise it would have been a complete waste of money. Probably made from arty types and full of symbolism that today's Chardonay socialists seem so in. Frankly, this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave chaps that never came back. Someone gives you the funding to make a decent movie that is at least equivalent to saving Private Ryan. Hopefully, RSL will put as much distance between itself and this movie as possible. The story has to tell from all sides the Australians, the locals and the Japanese. Although it is very unlikely to get the latter to tell the truth about something that happened during World War II. Basically its garbage, don't see it, don't buy it. Go away
