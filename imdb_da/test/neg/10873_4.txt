Director / Manager Larry Bishop tried way too hard with Hell Ride. The movie will be edgy, witty, provocative, outlandish, bite all this, apparently in a Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie style. But it is not angular. The references seem forced. The dialogue tries to be smart and fails. The humor is never fun. Nice try to put a gritty tone, but we had to worry about the characters or the story for it to succeed. <br /> <br /> What you're back with is cool Harleys and beautiful girls who surround a bunch of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what looks like an attempt to make a modernized Sergio Leone western . If this movie can make recent generations interested in the 60s and 70s movies, Kudos for that. But in itself it is quite boring and irrelevant. I think there's a place of style over substance. But this movie is not.
