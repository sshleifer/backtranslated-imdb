It's a story as old as a man. The jealousy of another man's wife and belongings. There are even bids against it. <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Burr ("Perry Mason", "Ironside") is the head of a runner plantation who is looking for the owner's wife and feels he is not treated with respect. The wife, star Barbara Payton, who was trying to get back after a series of sordid affairs, wanted Burr to kill her husband, Paul Cavanagh. But lurking was a strange woman, the housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek) who sees everything, and who could get voodoo to avenge the injured, who also included another young woman (Carol Varga) who Burr also testified of love. <br /> <br /> Burr is poisoned and becomes or believes he becomes a gorilla. Payton will have to meet with King if she ever wants her marriage completed when he enters the jungle every night. The end is predictable. But the question of this movie is why Payton would ever be scared. With the sharp pointed missiles protruding from the chest, no animal could get close to her to do damage.
