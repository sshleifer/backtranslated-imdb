I chose this DVD out of cheepo bin at Walmart because the cover showed one of the planes I flew during Viet Nam (C-123k). I did not fly to Air America but knew to be a C-123 pilot, I knew a lot who did, including those flying in my Reserve Unit home. I'm not a film critic, but I wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make movies like this. The best part of this movie should go to the camera man. The flying shot and stunts (though quite cartoonish) are excellent. The movie begins with Hollywood's favorite fall man in 1969. But the fact is, Nixon didn't start Air America, he didn't start the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon's inherited lies, war and Air America. It is not fair or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. No one was smart enough to fly a C-123 was stupid enough not to know what they were with. That makes the Downey character incredible. A C-123 was a robust airplane. It could easily fly on an engine or the two auxiliary jet engines. The three stooges shoot a duck with a shot is more likely. Pilots flying with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA, they were not ruthless soldiers of wealth. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous job. They got double time for retirement. They were not obliged to sell dope or weapons to get a good pension. Dope was legal and a lifestyle in SEA as it is still in Afghanistan today. If individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not CIA policy. The CIA fought for a war against communism, not drugs. The author based his story on "war stories". Pilots love to BS someone who wants to buy them a beer and listen. The author and director who had an ax to paint about Viet Nam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts - it blames Nixon for what existed for years. Remember, he didn't become president until January 20, 1969. My favorite scene is the landing up the hill in the jungle. Air America pilots were flying in places where aircraft designers never thought it was possible. Their were lots of funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the director chose to use the oversized rubber shoes to show how stupid the CIA was. This scene shows that the director and author fell for some pilot beams and the joke is on them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
