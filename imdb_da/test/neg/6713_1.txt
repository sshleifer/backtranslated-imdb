I think Cockpuncher is the best piece of work that has come out of the Steven Seagal factory for a long time. This movie was the first I've seen since the fine movie preview. My point? He's finished. Each movie is the same. Maybe he'll be good at Machete because he doesn't want to be the star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thank you for speaking to UCSB when I went to college. It was a wonderful speech. You have really affected some people out there. <br /> <br /> So I'll write ten lines on this movie? Umm .... I like smoking the guy who killed a lot of fools. When someone smells menthols LOOK OUT. Because there could be a killer with a silence and another loud voice that wants to kill you. Is it ten?
