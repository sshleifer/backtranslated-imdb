A really fun story story with good actors, but it somehow misses. The actors are older, but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better make-up, photography or something. It should be a love story, and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street movie. I liked the cast, but I think the performance was pretty boring. This is where the director's weakness shows. Maybe if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg directed it would have been a much better movie.
