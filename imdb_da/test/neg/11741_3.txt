What an embarrassment ... This does not do justice to the original with horrible plays from everyone in this movie, Hitchcock is going to spin in his grave. Scence where Marion is killed in the shower is just as inactive and unoriginal. The only good thing is that they used the same music and it is so obvious that killing her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
