I left the theater and I was only 10 years old. It's so bad it sucked. The reason was terrible and the play was worse. Leslie Nielson was ashamed of himself and it should also be the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this disaster with a friend, and even in the young innocent age I didn't even laugh at the movie. We (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. We ended up going into the 'R' movie, my parents were in. The bottom line - this flick was fricking badly. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-who? This movie could have scared me for life if I saw the popular cartoon on TV as a kid, but fortunately I had never seen it so I was spared the pain, but I will never come back the precious minutes of my life I wasted .
