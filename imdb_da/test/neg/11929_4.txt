It's a bit uncomfortable when a studio refuses to screen a movie for the press before it goes into publishing. The fact that many movies suck is not surprising, but when a studio admits so much in advance, the film process becomes a passion game of some sort. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, as "Aeon Flux" is not nearly the front end to the taste and decency you might expect given above. Although ultimately overwhelmed by its faults, it has at least (kind of) an idea to play around. Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have little idea how to do it all. <br /> <br /> It's the future. There has been a plague. There is a dictatorship and there are rebels. The latter is known as Monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racers, they are trying to overthrow it earlier, called the Goodchild regime. The regime is occasional privilege for the citizens, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her friends can stand. Through a kind of biochemical virtual reality technology, the monks receive orders from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mysterious clergy-type, who seems to have been crossed with a carrot. It is up to Aeon to tie up some formidable, futuristic spandex collections to execute High Carrot's orders, which, of course, are a version of "destroying the regime." For years, having seen her sister run by Goodchilds, she needs a little convincing. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, things become complicated. The Goodchilds may not be quite what they think, and Aeon himself may have an unexpected story with them. Although it is randomly confused, the film's central objection (which I will not reveal anymore) will contain some nice notions of human existence and survival. There is room for much more study that the film does not use, but the ideas are there at least. The major problems with "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has made the confusing decision to film almost all the actions so closely that we can rarely follow what is happening. To make matters worse, it is edited in a flurry of cuts that leave us completely lost. The result is some serious spatial disorientations that take over the movie. Aeon Flux's aesthetic is one of slim costume, oddly angled architecture and creepy figures. Much of the action takes place in minimalist open spaces, asking for some unbroken long shots that can convey the grace and athleticism that comes with the above. Instead, we get split seconds with flying limbs, breaking glasses and accompanying sound effects. <br /> <br /> There's a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of "Aeon Flux". Put these things in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, say, and the results may be quite different. As it is, however, I felt that "Aeon Flux" deliberately pushes me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This movie is unattuned to its own forces. As a beginner poker player has a royal flush, it somehow finds a way to lose despite its potential.
