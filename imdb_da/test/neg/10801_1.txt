It's Sooooouullltakaaaa! <br /> <br /> Wow. What a skin peels bad film. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K .... Just some things to point out ... <br/> 1) The incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. I need advice now. <br /> <br /> 2) There is no God who is just Dude .. I love the quote from Crow. <br /> <br /> 3) Whatever happens to the nuns who took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a terrible emptiness in my stomach. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, don't watch this movie un-MSTied ... It has Joe Estevez as the main star .. Yikes .. <br /> <br /> 1/10 for un-MSTied 8 / 10 for MSTied.
