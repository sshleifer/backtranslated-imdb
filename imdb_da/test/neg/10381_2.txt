Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a film about an obsessed young girl. Should I describe more of the plot to you? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two scary scary movies. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not by a long shot. It is certainly not as terrible as a low-budget copy of The Exorcist could have been. From start to finish, it has the feel of a "made for Sci-Fi channel" production. It's one of the movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show). Makeup and effects were absolutely ridiculous. The action was terribly bad. There wasn't a single performance that didn't cause me to rolled my eyes or giggle. Oh, except perhaps for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the Sheriff. The manuscript was not so terrible, but it was certainly not special. It seems that through most of the movie, everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with whoever they are with the demon's occupied girl in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently, if your teenage daughter is obsessed with a demon, then all you have to do is lock them in the room. C'mon. And if your daughter is in possession, don't worry too much, because all that does, make them talk in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare down and put trainers in their bed. In addition, there is nothing to worry about. Apparently, she was in possession of a low budget D-List demon. There were none of the horrific acts carried out by A-List demons who crucified intercourse, painful distortions of the body, or even projectile vomiting. <Br /> <br /> Absolutely ridiculous movie. Not worth even a discount rental. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
