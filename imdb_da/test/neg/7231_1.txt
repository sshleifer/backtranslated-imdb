Just finished seeing this one after getting sick to get ready for the Michigan Bar Exam. I wanted something that was thoughtless and that I could just sit back and say, "What the hell were they thinking?" I was not disappointed with this commitment, but had I seen this in a serious mood, I would have been irate. The company that did this thing only spliced ​​CGI footage from the first octopus and added a small recording with a false octopus that makes it used in the "Bride of the Monster", resembling a masterpiece with special effect film. Since when does an octopus catch? The reason is that a NYPD diver examines some murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the fourth of July. He and his partner (who are soon to be transferred or soon to be munched by a fig bucking squid) examine in a rather eerie way (constantly believing that a huge squid will kill humans) and occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the mayor's office. Of course, it is believed that an octopus can get it so big until the case attacks the police and the girl from the mayor's office. Surprisingly, hell doesn't break loose and only a few policemen and a few more civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lamb. Don't bother with that.
