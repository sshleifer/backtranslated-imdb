I had great hopes when I entered the theater - after seeing the trailer I was so hyped as the next person to see good talent participating in the preparation of a story with a beautiful premise. It is disappointing to see this talent off with the bad composition of songs - the words are lumpy and cheesy, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. I wouldn't find it hard to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In Mandarin they just sound weird. <br /> <br /> The musical objects were also cut together badly - too fast to be fun, and the shootings of the actors who looked at the attack lasted too long. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the next disappointment. Suffice it to say, it is very obvious where the special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not the Moulin Rouge, nor is it in the mood, despite the occasional (and very similar) elongation theme. For a long time to tell a simple story.
