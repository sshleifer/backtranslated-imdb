I wrote an essay in 1981, the year I graduated in high school called "last American virgin". I also had a friend named Nancy, who was a prostitute in this movie. apparently her daughter got hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house. a year later I wake up one morning and see the ad for this movie. I was 18 years old and based the essay on experiences in my life. The film is slightly different from my essay, but certainly taken from it. I had no evidence of this issue except my English teacher Mr.Versace, who gave me an A on my essay.I let it go & never did anything about it. I figured what was going around going around.i still wouldn't take any action against anyone involved in this movie. I just needed to get it off my chest, as I never really told anyone about it except my closest friend and they agreed to keep it a secret. That same year it came out I saw nancy in a market, she actually had the nerve to ask me if I had good stories or scripts for her to look at. I guess that's what Hollywood is about, getting stories from where you can. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen though. <br /> <br /> Ghost writer!
