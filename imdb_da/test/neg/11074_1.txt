The person who wrote the summary and rave review for this movie is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies. From the beginning, this was just about cheap ripoff of "The Descent", a much better movie that certainly does not start slowly. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of "The Cavern", I was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and unoriginal it was, how badly written, badly acted and badly directed it was. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and it says a lot when I recently suffered from "Pulse". I cannot believe that this waste has actually won awards that only show that the quality of marijuana and other illicit drugs is much better in Australia and other countries than in the United States. The scenarios where the group of "creature" runs badly, especially the delayed "upside-down camera" intended to show disorientation, but only comes as a cheap effect, as a first-year film student would be adequately considered for of their teacher. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this "instructor" will probably continue to make other movies, more than likely of the same low quality as this "movie", since I'm sure he hasn't learned from his mistakes which in this picture was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> If I had my way, the whole cast and crew would be sent up to the river for life without parole. This film is a crime against humanity.
