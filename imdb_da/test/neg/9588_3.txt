This film tries to spot the study time in Hollywood and the morale of the 1950s. Guy Stone is supposed to be a Rock Hudson type, but both script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, giving an unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience is having trouble suffering from this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who deliberately uses and throws the sweet, beautiful young men who share his bed with a few hours. Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's Celibate Lesbian Manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her. The error lies in the dialogue, which is a bit lumpy, and the film suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Carrie Preston's Sally owes more to Ellen Greene in "The Little Shop of Horrors". As written, Preston's Sally is good for a laugh, but a little different. Newbie Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He cannot act and seems to have been thrown to his warm body and good looks. Like many recent films, the "Straight-Jacket" is a "dramedy" - a comedy film that changes quietly to a two-thirds drama of the film through the movie. And just like almost all dramas, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. <br /> <br /> In spite of Skywalker Sound's expensive services, the sound quality of the film leaves much to be desired. The abuse of the musical soundtrack also creates a distracting amount of signals. <br /> <br /> The film failed to satirize anything about the 1950s. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain, which perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the emergence of sound as well as the studio mentality of formal films, Straight-Jacket fails to portray Hollywood in the 1950s at all well. Dialogue, sentences and key performance are non-descriptive rather than dead stereotypes from the 1950s Hollywood. The same can be said for the lighting of the general morals, social tendencies and fads of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the conversion of Guy's home to the dead-dead satire of the 1950s at home in "Little Shop of Horrors". There is no comparison; "Little Shop" hits the nail on the head, while the "Straight-Jacket" doesn't even know there is a nail. <br /> <br /> Motivations also appear to be accompanying. Rick Foster must be a principled liberal, but he almost immediately falls for a materialistic schmuck like Guy Stone. Rick is fine with Guy's closeted status for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he becomes a conflict for reasons that are completely unclear. And even though Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this plot disappears just a few minutes later without comment. Rick comes out as a gay man from the 1990s, not a gay writer of the 1950s. In fact, modern morality is sufficient for this movie - as it should not be, if it really was a satirical look at homophobia in the 1950s Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Plot holes in this ragtag film are also abundant. Saul says repeatedly that he will turn Freddie Stevens over to feds, but never do it - so Freddie can get out of Guy. Jerry and Saul's plot of "in" Guy has no meaning, and Sally is not a sudden decision to blame. And while Guy has admitted that he is gay, it doesn't seem to matter, and he ends up with a famous star and playwright anyway. Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​are capable of storing this movie. The kinematics of Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. At times, the movie looks almost like a filmed game instead of a movie picture (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is limited to interim images, and the movie is incredibly static. The editing of Chris Conlee doesn't help the movie either. Long scenes that would benefit the insertion of close-ups or shifts in view remain uncut. Whether this is due to lack of coverage or poor editing, it is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of dullness. <br /> <br /> The movie relies heavily on the CGI effects of Guy's home, created by visual effect designer Thomas Dickens. But CGI looks clumsy and hokey, and it's very noticeably amateurish. My overall impression of this movie is that the jokes are cheap and light, the plot is confused, the characterization is wildly inconsistent and far from markers, the satire non-existent, the show overbroad and off the ground, and cartoon timing off. It's almost an amateur movie. It's like someone took a high school production and threw $ 10 million on it.
