And it's only January, I'm still sure about it! <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst Swedish movie I have ever seen, and being honest Swedish film is not so good in general. It has been claimed to be "original", and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who have never seen an English-speaking film, for those of us who have been in the cinema for the last 10 years it cannot help but feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein has sat for a weekend through the most successful films from the last few years and tried to squeeze it all together into a Swedish package. What can I say the outcome can only be ... poor. First of all, the story is just weak at first, even worse when it's not just a bad story, it's a desire to combine into very bad stories - first a failed attempt to make Swedish action at la Matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story. And if you thought it couldn't be worse then you will notice all the "cool stuff" that has just been thrown in there for absolutely no reason more than in a bad way trying to show that Sweden can also make Hollywood movies - which we can't try either. For example, the main plot is trying to deepen by allowing young people to play a computer game called Storm, which has absolutely nothing in the story with history, or, for example, how there is a "Storm" internet site, while suddenly the main characters are consciousness - I really don't think Stein or Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the film, more than just trying to show off bad extra effects. For the actors, I must admit that Eric Ericson does a good job, unless he does the same work throughout the film. Even tough Storm is trying to be a movie about the personal development of DD, he doesn't change a bit in his way of acting. Jonas Karlsson, to be honest, I thought he was a fairly respected actor, but judging by storm ... really, he just has to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. Finally, Eva Röse is just outside criticism, both her character and her acting. The only reasons Storm succeeds in not getting a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson, and what can I say, at least try it ..
