Perhaps if you have never read any English literature or have just seen the Hollywood version of a book, you can find profit in this horrible movie. It has Shoreditch's instructional and scripting skills. The BBC 1995 adaptation is both very entertaining and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well. The characters in this production are very miscast, Sutherland as Bennet seems like a total buffoon. Bingley also works the fool, and it is impossible that he is my friend of Darcy. I can't imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version. Quotes from the book were thrown outside the context. Huge chunks are missing, the important episode of Wickham shining over. <br /> <br /> However, Collins is very good and towers over the other members of the cast. The only good thing is we didn't pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and need to keep a table away from wobbling.
