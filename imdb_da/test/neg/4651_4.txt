Definitely not a good movie, but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be. Nightmare in wax tells the story of a man who has had his face confused in a typical flashback scene, making his revenge on the direct and indirectly responsible for the loss of his life - especially the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical style, though limited flair. In fact, I thought he gave one of his better performances. What does it really mean? Mitchell wears an eyelid, throws endless cigarettes, wears a modley tunic and speaks to his creations in wax. They are not your common wax dummies, but people who are still alive are controlled by some serum that causes them to lose control of all neurological function. They become zombies in reality. I thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else. It has a little ridiculous explanation but serves the plot. This is a 60s movie to be sure of some psychedelic camera work by Bud Townsend and company. The action is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger give interesting turns. The wax numbers in Hollywood's failed era are made very effective, and most of the placement recordings were highly credible. The end of the film spreads into something that is not quite right - either another example of the 60's cultural cinema or the end of the scriptwriter's creativity. I knock on the latter. Despite his many mistakes, I saw the movie. The opening scene, depicting an actor who was needled, was effectively performed as it was a police force on the waterfront.
