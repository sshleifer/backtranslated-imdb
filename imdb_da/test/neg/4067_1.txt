My suggestion ..... This movie was really meant to be a "comedy", wasn't it? !!!! If not, manufacturers, directors, actors and "hairdressers" should really choose another career! Now, the guidelines for my post must require a minimum of "10 lines". How in the world can I add more to this? Hmm ... let me see. Oh yes, the beginning of the movie was pretty hilarious with the "crash landing" scene. Hard that the plane didn't hit the tanker and a lot of "martians" would have distorted the wreck (obviously hiding) and decided to take over the "world planet" and make a better movie. Now it would have been a good start! <br /> <br /> T
