GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It is very horrified as if it had many ideas, but lacked the ability to bring them all together in a coherent story. Instead, we get different plotlines that differ in their own separate small films. Oh, eventually they meet, but it seems too little ... superfluous. Notice is the girlfriend and her problems in the hospital. Was this ... interesting? Then there were "we are spirits, and therefore we have no physical" elements that lead to the same problem people had with GHOST, namely: If the characters have no physical character (ie no formal form) and they can phasing through walls and what not, how do they keep falling through the floor or hovering the ceiling for that matter? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was heavily adorned as a new black South Korean movie. There are lots of special effects, but the film itself is hollow, and its faux melodrama will only "touch" those who are easy to, yes, touch first. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films, go to www.nixflix.com
