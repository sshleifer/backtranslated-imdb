Rourke makes his usual bit part like a creepy, rancorous, neanderthal, horrible, evil smoke in the same form as in "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of it is the case with waste. <br /> <br /> He has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this is just undesirable, underestimating Rourke, averted him and does not matter to his characterization as an actor. Having seen "A Prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome", "Barfly", "9 1/2 Weeks", "Dragon Year" etc. For many years I considered Rourke as an excellent, intelligent, intelligent man. I think he has changed since. <br /> <br /> He looks cold and burned out. <br /> <br /> "He looked with gloomy appearance; / Despair inhabited his chest / And made the man a perfect pest." (Belloc, "The Example"). <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no reason to see this boring movie except that Rourke was in.
