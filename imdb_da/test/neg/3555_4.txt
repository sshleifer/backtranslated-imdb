The action in this movie was of old school: corny and stiff. Irene Dunne is brilliant and comes out of the best, even though she has some very unnatural lines to say. Yet her ability to convey feelings comes through. <br /> <br /> Old movie buffs will at least find some redeeming qualities in this movie through the observation of film technology from the 1930s. Otherwise, it's not really that worthwhile.
