"The Bone Snatcher" starts very promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of invisible evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated African desert movie scene. While controlling the pipelines in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by an apparent urge-world creature that consumes their flesh and leaves only a pile of half-open bones. The expedition staff sent to rescue them discover that the monster is a superior mutated murder queen and soon find themselves trapped in the eerie desert as well. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respectable excitement level until the character of the monster is identified. Immediately after that, the film quickly becomes an ordinary being-function, with all the characters escaping from the survival race one by one. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is grimly boring; with the inevitable love story clich√©s as well as a complete absence of gory murder seen pieces. The characters are all unacceptable stereotypes that work and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance. There is the rookie to prove himself, the woman with brain capacity apart from her warm appearance, the unpleasant experienced guy who solves himself at the end through self-sacrifice and ?? Last but not least ?? who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all sorts of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like outer space training of "Alien" and "Predator". The ant has infrared vision and crumbles when it's shot, yawns! The movie actually enjoys its unique setting and the handful of ugly images of broken bodies. This could have been a modest gem, but instead it is less than mediocre. Avoid.
