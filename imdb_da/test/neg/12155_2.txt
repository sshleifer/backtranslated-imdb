The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of history was uninteresting, the film ended when he became gingesh khan, I always thought something really interesting had happened afterwards. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie was playing have beautiful landscapes, but the film hasn't exploited it. Witnesses where really poor. The narrator, Geshesh himself, could have told a little more about Mongolian history, traditions, etc. My co-viewer didn't know anything about it, so he was a little lost. I looked forward to watching this movie, but was really disappointed at all. It was one of 3 movies I have ever seen in the cinema, where I expected to leave before the end.
