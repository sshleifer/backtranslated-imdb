I just can't get it, freaks out on the planet talking about this as a must, they even dare call it an exploitation because the obsessed girl seduces priests and masturbates all the time. Don't let me laugh. I saw the movie, seductive is only at the end of the movie and does not call it seductive, it's just bad language, she is talking. And the masturbation scene is also a big laugh, she tries to seduce her father while he masturbates, let me be ready with her clothes on you out there. It is not at all horrible or bloody, everyone is vomiting outside the door, well, let me tell you that one is better for me than this flick. Only the last 5 minutes the possessed is vomiting and has nice eyes. If I had known that this is so bad, I would never get a copy. If you really want to see an exploitation of exorcism, see Angel above, The Devil Below or other cheeses. a waist of time this is.
