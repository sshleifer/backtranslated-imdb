Plumbing, maybe it should have been the title. Poor dialogue delivered at the snail's pace. All characters are a single dimension except one. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this clich√© ridden two-hour move. After growing up in the seventies, this film lacks serious detail, atmosphere and authenticity. It was surprising that this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, one who should recognize a sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that illuminates this movie. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
