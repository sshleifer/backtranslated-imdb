I just recently saw the gate of heaven. After I saw this 3 hours 40 my epic western, who is not a Western, I read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all the events and the movie itself, I still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I think when someone tells you to see it, they actually try to drill you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this even indulgent over the thought truely bad movie, I have to ask why. Although this is not a reason to hate it, it is historically far away. It's pretending to be a situation that happened in Wyoming called Johnson County War. It was simply that the cattle chamber in the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed that they were all immagrants. You find that you simply don't care about these people and hope they are all killed because at least something would happen. Everyone in the movie talks about things happening and it never appears. When you sit on this huge waste of time, you wonder how you could actually make a 4-hour epic where nothing happens. Oh and by the way Johnson County War was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County War was actually called that because it almost happened, 2 people actually died. I can't warn you enough of this movie. But if you are like me, the idea of ​​watching a movie that ruined a career and putting "United Artists on" for sale seems to be an interesting case to study, so look at this horrible, narcissistic, subtitled, and much-photography movie in every way . (which is nice sometimes)
