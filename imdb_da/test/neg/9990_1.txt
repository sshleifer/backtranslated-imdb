I watched this movie at the age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation was ahead of it, and even though all my friends were legal too, I had the courage to go into the video store and actually rent it. We gathered in a house where the parents had left the city on the weekend. Although we were close to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film interpreted both and did not give the expected shame we felt. It did not disappoint with regard to totally free content, but it was disappointed in every other way. Caligula tries to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition and exposes the public to the worst of both worlds. The movie's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it actually gives far more than its share of true graphic sex. But when you put that gender in the context of Caligula's depraved governance, that action dignifies even less than the average adult film. Gender without context can at least be physically pleasing to the adults involved, but joy and perhaps even consent is largely absent in the Caligula world. In it, sex at best serves as inactive pastime and at worst, as an instrument of sadistic dominance. Today, it is commonplace to hear words such as "sin" and "weakness" used face to describe actions that are pleasing, yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond facetiousness by portraying true aggravation and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it. <br /> <br /> The historical parts not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the flesh, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide long stretches of tireless tedium. Rarely has a movie been so boring. The sex, after the first shock and astonishment falls, only contributes to the general monotony of the image. <br /> <br /> Rarely does discussion of this movie involve violence. While many movies are more violent than Caligula has been made, few can compete against the shock value of the violence. Honest, unsustainable barbarity as well as hyperdropal sexuality characterized Caligula's imperiality. Violence is even less so for the heart's weakness than the flesh. <br /> <br /> A review like this is likely to generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why anyone will watch this movie; After all, I gave myself the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review will at least provide potential viewers with knowledge of making a well-informed decision as to whether or not to see it. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as "hours of boredom punctured by moments of pure terror." This statement describes Caligula perfectly. You have been warned.
