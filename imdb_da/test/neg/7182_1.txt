Another example that we should stay away from trying to make spectacular action films in Sweden, it does not work, except for Widerberg's still unmatched man on the roof. Stormers do the best I suppose, and some scenes are mildly effective, but the plot is FULL holes. Why does Hamilton continue to attack the base by knowing that his wife is being held hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his Bad Guy part was very subdued. I am constantly amazed that relatively large Swedish films like this one are made without a sensible, working script. 1 out of 5.
