Originally the harp as a sequel to "The Slumber Party Massacre" series, this movie falls flat on that face with a new title. First, if you want to include the word "massacre" in your movie's title, you deliver better. This certainly does not. There are no gore, no on screen words and no chainsaw, as art would make you believe. Instead, we get a paper-thin, overdone plot of a group of cheerleaders stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be dismissed one by one. Again, this movie could have been ok if the quotient was a little up. Why directors, especially those who make direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show that Gore is outside of me. Now I'm not a big fan of excessive gore, but move on ... why else would anyone hire a movie called "Cheerleader Massacre ??" In addition to this problem, the film suffers from a cheap cheap image camera. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors are not that good. It tries to throw us away from who the killer might be, but even that fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. People if you run over this movie, go away and go find the original "Slumber Party Massacre." 2 out of 10
