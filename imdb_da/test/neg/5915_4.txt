Produced at some point in his career, where he had the juice to do what he wanted, Eddie Murphy took on the task of producing, controlling, co-writing and starring in HARLEM NIGHTS, an animal-looking but ultimately empty gangster saga. about a group of black night club owners / gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930s, led by a wisecracking hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and his adopted father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid being overrun by whites mobsters who think they take over turf it seems they believe theirs simply because of their color. This was an idea that probably looked good on paper, but it certainly lost something in the translation. This was a vanity piece for Eddie and I think he is spreading a little too thin here and trying to be the whole show here. Admittedly, it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on the screen, but the rest of the great support cast, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw and Eddie's brother, gets really precious little to do (though I will admit Murphy's battle situation with Della Reese is hysterical fun and probably the best scene of the movie). Murphy has clearly poured a lot of money into this movie and a lot of it shows on the screen. Art and direction are impressive, and the breathtaking costumes should have won an Oscar, but this was a great mischief for Eddie as he certainly tried to wear too many hats.
