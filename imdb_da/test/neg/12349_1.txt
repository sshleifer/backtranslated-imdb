All pro comments on this movie claim that the movie is balanced. It is their main reason for giving a high rate to the movie. But a movie is not balanced when the main offender is analyzed, gets the last world in each subject. The director himself admitted this at the first San Francisco film festival. She justified it by saying she couldn't waste the chance of accessing Fujimori. It may be true, but by showing so much of Fujimori's take on the problems, the film clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare any of the other commentators to prove this wrong Tip 1: To claim Harvard professors, intellectual and Latin American diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: Disagree with the director also doesn't help your argument (The director says she thinks that Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore he portrayed him that way)
