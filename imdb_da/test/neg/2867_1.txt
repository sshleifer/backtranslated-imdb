I couldn't stand to see much of this crap. This is your standard junk that some annoying women love - old English era drama with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to be picked up either directly from olives twist or another dick's novel. This uses the usual clichés of the Victorian era. Some idiotic people really believe that the whole emotional torture of that culture is so bloody suppressed, somehow fascinating and romantic. This is juice, clean and completely undesirable and dull as to see grass grow. As such, it is perfect for women who need some kind of English snoozer romantic drama in the country in a Victorian setting, but for this man, this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment for seeing a bunch of sad boring scenes with unoriginal characters who speak in the miserable forced and false English accent.
