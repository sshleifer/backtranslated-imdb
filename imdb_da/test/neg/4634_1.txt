I saw this movie and was bored of my mind! I'm a fan of peanuts, but I can't understand why Charles Schultz is making this disaster! Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I can't believe Snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and turn a few cold without standing watch! The story was completely nonsense, even for cartoon characters. It takes them too long to come to France, and when they come to France, I had the feeling that the author (I still can't believe it was Schultz) didn't know what to do when they got there. <br /> <br /> Peanuts are best made in 30 minute episodes, not 80 minutes of movies. <br /> <br /> Go home Charlie Brown, you are here best there. <br /> <br />
