I can't believe I actually bought this movie! It stinks! ... Where I Live Mexican Movies Mexican movies are never announced or even available ... you can't find them in the regular rental sites ... so I had to buy it ... I really like Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and my people, and they are different from what you used to care for ... but it was so predictable !!! You could guess what would happen ... I'm not a horrible movie! It just wasn't worth what I paid for it! yeah ... but if you have time and really get bored then you should see it .. but if you love Mexican movies and love theater itself then don't see it, it will be painful! laugh out loud
