I saw this movie only coz it was expected to be another entertainer of David Dhawan. <br /> <br /> Poor bad comeback by David Dhawan. He has made lots of funny movies in the past, which didn't make any sense, but none of them was a crap behind !! What a waste of talent and beauty it was? Donno why actors agree to make movies like this. <br /> <br /> There was nothing practical in this movie. The movie is under par and does not justify Standard and potentially Bollywood has. The only thing worth seeing in this movie was Katrina, but we don't have to watch a movie like this to see her! Being a remake of the Hollywood flick Hitch, it is clear that Bollywood executives cannot make a proper remake. I consider this to be the worst ever movie I've seen. Terrible 1/10
