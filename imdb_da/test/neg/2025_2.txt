Screenwriter Steve Tesich's sophomore action (after the wildly overpriced BREAKING AWAY) is a compendium of clich√©s, coincidence and dour melodrama. Perhaps he lived some of this; If so, I'm sorry to say that he could inexplicably dramatize some of the convincing. <br /> <br /> In fairness he has not helped much here by Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done remarkable work in the past (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE BIG MAN), but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesich's story. <br /> <br /> They throw the battles as best they can, but become saddled with weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathies should be reserved specifically for Craig Wasson, whose moral performance presupposes the imminent fad of his leading career, as well as the embarrassingly untied Jodi Thelen, perhaps as the movie's extremely unlikely 'femme fatale'. <br /> <br /> It seems to be longer than it is, and all points made are heavy-handed and obvious. See Arthur Penn's earlier take on the subject of the 60s, the drab and elegant ALICE'S RESTAURANT; That's all this is not.
