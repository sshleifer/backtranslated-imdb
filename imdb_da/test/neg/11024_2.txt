Ineffective, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart has a marriage with Carole Lombard. Having hit hard times, he maintains a degrading job, a debugging, passive-aggressive, indulgent live-in mother who is in great need of an epic smackdown and an infinitely crying baby. The movie trowels at failure and squalor to no clear end. Want to see a few bicker with her mother in ninety minutes? Many scenes have a screaming baby. The film fails to elucidate why we will endure the mother from hell or why Jimmy Stewart cannot grow a couple. Who would see this? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or charm? It is absolutely depressing and unbearable.
