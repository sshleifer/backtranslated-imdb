Let's see, cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a carton scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some carton people who have been drugged and kidnapped. You will be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their only deserts! Turns out that drug experiments have allowed them to sense another world .... the world of religious imagination! - Complete with cardboard demons that look like they are made of papier mache. Everybody is beaten to hell except for a poor guy who goes to heaven where he can probably spend eternity with the blocks that created this masterpiece of the absurd. I think I would choose Hellfire myself. Go see something else unless you are stoned, in which case you actually like it! Couldn't hurt!
