First, I point out that I used to love Winnie The Poo as a kid, and I really enjoyed The Tigger Movie, even though I'm in my 20s. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad I was ashamed to have been a fan of my youth. OK, OK I know this is a movie for kids and is not aimed at people like me anyway, but it's my thoughts about the movie for other people of my age. <br /> <br /> The biggest downturn in this movie is the hefty lump itself, it must be the most annoying sign I've seen in a child's movie (possibly even more annoying than the young child in Monsters Inc). It has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, I know Pooh movies aren't exactly high foreheads, but it was insulting to even a 2-year intelligence! <br /> <br /> Secondly - where was the story? Former Pooh outings had at least one point on the story - yes I can see that this was about accepting people who are different to you in your hearts - but it was real, and I felt I had seen a 5-minute cartoon on the children's TV. br /> <br /> I don't have my own kids, but when I do, I fully intend to show them quality children's movies like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Finding Nemo (though they are too childish for me in these days I can see how they would be of great appeal to young children). Not so with this scary attempt at a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing - not enough Eeyore! He should have his own movie!
