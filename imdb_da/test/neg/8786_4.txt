I rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995. After rewatching it again, my idea of ​​it hasn't changed much. <br /> <br /> I was an adult then and I'm still grown up now! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did not disturb me. This is not a documentary, it is a fantasy rig where animals can speak! <br /> <br /> While I didn't care too much about the songs, I liked the one at the end of the picture where it sang by barry manilow and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to make an excuse for the primitive animation by saying that CGI was not used often in animated features, but let's not forget that THE LION KING was released about a year earlier and that possibly packed more excellently than any animated feature that came before it !! <br /> <br /> But I think it's pretty fair to say that PEBBLE AND PINGOINEN were made on the cheap, while THE LION KING wasn't ... The high points for me in 1995 as well as in Today, the excitement is generated by the few dangerous (mostly) underwater hunting scenes. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene taking place on a music note page and a little bit of love story. But most of the time the story went on and was boring. Worth seeing if you like animation, but if you are an adult and not a risk taker, get another Walt Disney production instead of this!
