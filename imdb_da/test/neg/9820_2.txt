I suppose the rave reviews on this site were from people who have never read the book - unfortunately for those of us who love the text, Hollywood forged itself by destroying it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where in the world came the woman's love interest, except that she replaced the cat, nor why our Rogue Male bought a helpful family back in Blighty - In fact, the vast majority of the book is has been carved and replaced with your standard cruddy love story. The ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was completely removed and our Rogue was given a name (none of them appeared to the second book). <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. Joan Bennett expands Dick Van Dyke into Mary Poppins for miles, and it goes a little way to save it. <br /> <br /> Ah well - Brits should probably avoid this. Trust me :)
