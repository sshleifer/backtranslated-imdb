All criticism of this movie is quite valid! It's pretty boring and filled with all sorts of senseless ridiculous things. A few exchanges nod their "good grub". A medium shot of a desk like a telephone rings until someone finally comes, sits down and answers it at a fairly relaxed pace. Quadruple or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo tuning and games take a break for a beer. Count a joke to a fawn, about a coarse seed trying to learn what to feed their babies, complete with many great mouth-watering expressions (needed for the weak punchline). Shredding cucumber and cream cheese sandwich on oatmeal, which for squeamish becomes unpleasant when it comes to people burned in a fire. Lots of apparent stock footage close up shot of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the forest. The movie starts with a forest fire, so for at least a few decades later some people in the same forest are killed by an ax. The killer was obviously not too satisfied with the ax he stole and kills other people with other opportunities for opportunities or his bare hands. <br /> <br /> If it is true that the movie in the version available on out-of-print video tape is cut, perhaps if there are many recordings that were cut, it deserves a different look at DVD. Otherwise, it's simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoor slasher fan.
