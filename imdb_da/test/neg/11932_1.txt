This movie is a cash in. A cash dependent on a rousing theme tune created for a former classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and then has most production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over Chris's lead role. I can't think of any actor who is less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hi, at least he could have shaved his hair and lost his hair, just for the sake of continuity. Some correction centers show this movie to punish offenders. One step out of the queue and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought forward and controlled. They didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a TV movie! Miserable.
