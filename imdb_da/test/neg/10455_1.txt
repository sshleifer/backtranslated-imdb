This movie was beyond horrible, it was a pimple on the movie industry's a * s. I know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average, but the responsible parties that came together for this epic dud should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think that the casting should be assembled between scenes and console each other to be in such a massive amount of mouth. I can hear it now, "You're being paid?" "No you?" I understand that this flick was more than likely made on a shoe string budget, but even with that in mind, it could still have been better. You are waiting for the appearance of a monster / creature, and when you finally see it, it is a great yawn. I'm so angry with myself to use 1.07 on this stink !!!
