The people who bashed this movie were trying to be as cool and smooth as the first one it is not. This movie was to be completely opposite to Ocean's 11. This has been said by many of the cast members and also the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean 12, while lacking a gripping plot, becomes bashed because it was different from what people wanted. If it was released before Ocean's 11, it would be taken very differently, not as a failed successor. The problem with successors is that people go into it with a preset idea of ​​how it should be like and have many expectations. They had to go into this movie with an open mind and not expect to be "Ocean 11, again".
