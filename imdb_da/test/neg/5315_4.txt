Back in 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld instructed a film that ended in many critics best of the lists, as this year's recaps were printed in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty, and it gave lead star John Travolta his second big hit for many years after Pulp Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi lenses. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on the wise guy Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempt to break into the film industry. For one, I was completely trapped by the different characters and sharp dialogue of the original. So much so that when I heard that there was a sequel, I seemed to refrain from my usual tremor that arises when a studio tries to rehash what was a good idea ten years later. The sequel, which is also based on a novel by Leonard, is this time directed by F. Gary Gray, an Italian Job in 2003, one of the highest grossing films of the year. Couples now expanding to include Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods, and you all have the opportunity of a great continuation in the exploitation of one of the more interesting characters in The 1990s. This time we round up when Chili (Travolta) leaves the film industry after being disappointed with both himself and the industry to participate in the production of a successor to his successful first film. Thanks to a small portion for his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the accident of his death, Chili decides to investigate the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This leads first to the famous Viper club, where Chile meets Linda Moon's song experience (Christina Milian) as a lead-up of an upstart trio, which can belt melodies like Whitney Houston (ie Whitney before Bobby Brown began bringing home the small packages of sugar). Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn), who, with her seemingly gay bodyguard, Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) plans to make sure Linda meets the last five years of her contract, even if it means putting Chili on ice. So with Linda's future in balance, Chili weaves an interesting web that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta audio mixer (Cedric), the Russian mob, police, Aerosmith's lead singer Steven Tyler and a lot of angry gun points. Woo-Wheee! It sounds interesting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool trying too hard to be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has no heart and no soul. Be Cool feel instead of being directed by a Saturday Night Live producer, as there are individual scenes or sketches that do not stretch over an entire movie. Take the stage, for example, where Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, as Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced and should have ended up on the rocky floor. Instead, it is linked between two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with any real momentum. The Aerosmith concert, and The Rock's tour of a boot store, are also leading examples of individual moments that do not make much of a movie when put together. But these are not the only problems with the sequel - which could probably rename product placement with the amount of 2-ways and Diet Pepsi's that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chili's serious appearance. The story contains almost every stereotype imaginable, and each one has just enough screen time to become a little offensive or embarrassing. Whether it's the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy who has a movie poster by Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone on the wall, there are no signs that offer us anything we haven't seen many times before and in much better movies. With the magic all but gone from the first movie, we end up with a subordinate product, which is the second movie in the last six months (Ocean's 13 is the other), sticking a bunch of stars on a tent just to end as a movie that no actor would bring to an open audition. Weather Cool was a big disappointment. I wanted it to be the shortest in the new millennium, and I ended up with a movie where the exits should have been a gas, but the experience left me with a stink.
