So unfortunately I and my buddy saw this !!! It was shown on a Sky Channel above called "Zone Horror", which basically shows crappy B movie horror movies 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this a look. Apart from the terrible action, the horrible plot, the gloomy effects, the creepy camera work and the brain numbering ridicule of it all, it was OK, LOL !!! In the seriousness, it was pretty funny to pick holes in it and laugh at the stupid actors. There is a bit of a carnation that fights the movie a bit, unfortunately it was "uggo" that got topless when my buddy calls her: oD If you get bored one evening and it happens by playing, take a chance, you can just like it :)
