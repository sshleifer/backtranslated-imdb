Stupid is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of a non-stop flight to Africa, but then worry about interfering with the natives. They put on the "blackface", crash the plane, try to survive on a plane wing floating in the ocean and then survive the wild animals as they land on land. <br /> <br /> After reading a few reviews before you saw this I knew what to expect. It was simply these two guys making their Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit impressions. Offensive to Blacks? Of course, but it is the 1930s for you. Some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. The biggest mistake I had with this cartoon was the sound, as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying. <br /> <br /> All in all, a curiosity piece, but don't let racism stop you from checking it out. At least, it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed .... for the better.
