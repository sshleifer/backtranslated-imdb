"Empire Nero" is the second film of the series of six works called "Empire". I've already negatively commented on the first: "Empire Augustus". This second television movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state-owned network has the same flaws. In addition, a large number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child, and Agrippina calls him "Nero, Nero". At that time, the name was Claudius. He was named Nero after adoption. Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie, but after his marriage to Octavia and his nomination for Emperor. When he becomes emperor, his sons are not adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And many many more. If you love the ancient Roman history, you can find yourself other examples. The "Empire" series continues with four more films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Roman Empire's Fall". Finally!
