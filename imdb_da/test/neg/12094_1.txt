I haven't been going through anything here for quite a while, but having had the misfortune to sit through this nonsense masking as entertainment, I had to make my thoughts. Usually, however, there is something bad that is a redeeming part, whether it is an actor who was okay, a scene that was acceptable, an attractive cast member or a general emotional moment. Unfortunately, it is not true here when the movie starts with horrible, with a ridiculous shooting that was so bad, I thought it was an exercise and two half-thoughts, otherwise known as the boys in blue chatting next to a school. <One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only starred in this, but also actually directed this garbage, and unlike his brothers can not act for toffee. Not that he was here alone, since everyone in it seemed to belong to the actor's play. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, for me, I saw only one hour at this masterpiece, as DVD wouldn't work and was probably made by the same fools who produced this. So, if you have nothing to do, but watch the paint dry, see it here as it is just as boring and ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
