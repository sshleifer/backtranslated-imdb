Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast of his empty story that didn't tell us anything new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and "talented immature student". The characters are not 'equally interesting nor sympathetic. Artistic it is so empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character without success. Too bad because sports games can be a really interesting subject that many could relate to. But I can't get a complete comment on this movie in any way when I came out of the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time ...
