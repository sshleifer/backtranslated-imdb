Let me see ... I've seen every movie Lou Ferrigno made. I've seen Batman & Robin ... twice. I've remembered the dancers in Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I've seen unfinished Blade Runner rip-off student films ... but this movie is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> This was the first movie to "straight to video market." So you can thank Blood Cult for all those mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies at your local Blockbuster. You should know that this is not even high quality video. This is consumer class. This is your father's video camera he never uses. This is what you should look at in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will not drill you with plot information as I get sleepy just thinking about it, but I will tell you that watching this movie is a kind of torture. I only see this movie when I'm angry with myself. So I recommend this movie if you are suicide or if you are up for a mighty challenge. <br /> <br /> If you happen to rent this movie (God has mercy), you will know what you are from the first 10 minutes. This is when you are hit by the usual horror movie intro. You know the drill. There is plenty of excitement and buildup before some girls die. Yes, you have seen it before, but not like this. This is the most boring intro I've ever seen. I honestly think that you could get a camera from ebay to ten dollars, get hold of that most smelled gin and candy and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner, and that would be more interesting than this intro. It bored me to cry. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes this movie so incredibly painful is its actors. Yes, I've seen bad plays. TRUST ME. I have seen 4-year productions by Oliver Twist with more realistic dialogue. The main actor makes me sick. The "supportive" actress is a train wreck of a human being. <br /> <br /> I don't even want to comment on the girlfriend. Real horror. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, rent this movie. You will never be depressed that you spent 3 dollars on something else.
