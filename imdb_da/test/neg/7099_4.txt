In the scale 1 to 10 I gave this a 4. I thought the movie was not very good, with too much violence and not a sign to suffer. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale I give this a 6. Many of the sex scenes were tame with an underlying ugliness. I always enjoy nudity, and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant come through, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
