French cinema sucks! Down with all those psychiotrical visions with their my-God-I-cultivated prominent attitudes! Pestilence to symbolic film-language and impenetrable chiffers! I no longer have any mind for it! Léos Carax, have you ever thought that a dialogue in a movie could be natural and alive ??? Maybe I'm too common to understand you? Or was it your job to confirm all clichés from a Frenchman that the world can have? Guillaume, the two-be-guilliotined, comes to his home palace, Mme. Deneuve, not in the picture, plays the whistle: "Here I am, honey!" At this moment I knew she was in the bathtub, and we'll see her lying there soon. Don't get me wrong, I'm not prudish, and the scary sex scene was climax in the movie. But it is in Berlin, we say "etepetete", what does something like "être-peut-être", a snobish, self-righteous, and the worst that is often seen in French movies, I can tell! Second example: She is beautiful and willing and looks at herself in a mirror, fights her hair and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushes into the living room, breathlessly shouts: "There is no escape, there is no escape!" Forty years after existentialist Sartres and consorts — what's new, what is it about? My God who is the woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be content with your life? And when you are not, please explain much better why !! Born French means you have to live a life of extravaganza, no escape, is that the meaning?
