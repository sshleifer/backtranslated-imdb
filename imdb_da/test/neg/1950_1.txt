I had noticed that this movie had been on Cinemax lately, so this morning I decided to watch it. I just finished the Infiltrator, which is a great movie, and I thought it was so good. From the description, the cable had the least. This movie was horrible. It's slow, pacing is awful, it feels like it lasts 4 hours. There is no real plot to talk about ... agh! How can anyone say something good about this movie. Rickman is good ... but he's always ... the other two characters work well, but there's no real story to support any of it. After 2 hours and you sit there wondering what is happening on the ground, where in the ground is plotted - it ends with a surprise that honestly just made me sick. Don't bother with this one.
