The only thing that does this is Corey's performance as the lunatic killer on the loose. What is left is a most impossible story of revenge and matrimony. Under walkie-talkie scenes, I had the feeling that Cotten squeezed a sweet potato and not a communication unit. Another interesting thing about this is that Alan Hale (Skipper from "Gilligan's Island") is not yet so fat and he can still lower his arms under his waist. In addition, there is not much to recommend here.
