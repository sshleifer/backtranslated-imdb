I'm not sure why I didn't like this movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too male or for something. Who was the target audience here? If you're the one and you liked it, then I'm happy with you. Personally, I found it a bit of a pill. The characters were uninteresting and unlikeable, the manuscript was simply embarrassing and some, but not all, of the actor were uninspired. Mawkish, boring and occasionally nauseating - There's probably something better. <br /> <br /> On a related question: Why is it that when I see Chris Klein in a movie, I get a craving for him stupid? Does anyone get it?
