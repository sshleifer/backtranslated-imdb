Apparently, in some eyes, there aren't enough horror movies these days when young people are being chased over a desert by a mysterious bloodthirsty gal in a truck. I think everything we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP may well be the worst of them. It's about a girl and her boyfriend leaving their lives behind to get together in California. Along the way, they stop in an ugly toilet so the young lady can relieve herself, but when she returns, she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone. Then she learns that the culprit is a guy who runs a yellow pickup that continues to steal and terrorize her as she hides in the toilets. This film is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring. The action is annoying, gore is mild, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the film, is anything but memorable. Horrible - horrible movie ...
