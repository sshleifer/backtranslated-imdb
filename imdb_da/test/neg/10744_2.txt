I appreciate satire that goes against my own views, but it must be witty and well-placed. This movie is ... how can I possibly explain it. It does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. In fact, it is hardly even horror. Dead soldiers come alive, but they are not interested in brains, only in voice chairs. Why? Cue an infinite stream of the most idiotic, banal, inflated windbag ravings of "poor president, bad conservative, bad republicans." What a self-sufficient, schmaltzy, cornball piece of fertilizer this was. Although they agree with the episode's "points", only the most stupid of the liberals would say they enjoyed it. So again, it is a great task in itself to assign a stupidity to the stupid, angry, hostile, antisocial and anti-something-half-liberal spectrum. <br /> <br /> Avoid as a liberal convention.
