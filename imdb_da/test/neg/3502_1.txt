What a disappointment. The story is so simple - "The good guys sometimes do bad things, and the evil ones sometimes do good things" - dressed in a racial attitude to make it seem smart, sophisticated and meaningful. It is not. It lacks any subtlety. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone again if you missed the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this to convince and move the audience it should represent the character's ambiguity and their motivation and actions; not just presenting it as a series of 180 degree changes in the actions of each character. <br /> <br /> Halfway I would really waste more time on it, but I thought I would stick to it if it was improved; big mistake I should have stopped then - it just got worse.
