I didn't expect much from this movie, but was eager to try something that I originally thought would be an early 80s teenage fear. Although three teenagers are a critical plot, it is not a teenage movie at all. <br /> <br /> 'The Power' is about a small aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor (who must be adult and thus, 'destroyed') becomes the ship to release all the evil of the idol and often with mortal consequences for not only the possessor's possession but by the owner himself. Having made several exchanges to control the control of this thing, three teenagers sound it and cannot figure out what it is, except that they have been strange and dangerous things since they found it. They offer to explain the situation of a news reporter who does not buy into the spiritual bologna. Although it is her producer who wants to investigate further, especially if it means he can gain control of the idol (I suppose teenagers are not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous lusts encouraged by the idol). It's a story told thousands of times, especially in the 1950s and 60s for screaming and science fiction. <br /> <br /> At least for me, this one was able to maintain some interest. Although it was low budget, it was not so cheap or filled with bad plays, as many of the low-budget, come-and-go scare courses in the previous decades (today have the same cheesy qualities but larger budgets) . We are sufficient enough to at least allow us to be at least slightly absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so on, despite a history of clich√©s. And even though it wasn't terrible, the special effects were done nicely. <br /> <br /> Again it is routine horror story, especially at the end (which, according to modern standards, has become a device that is annoyingly overused), but one that is not so embarrassingly bad. It may be worth checking out, even if just laughing.
