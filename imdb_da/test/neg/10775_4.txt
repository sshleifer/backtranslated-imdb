As we are aware, movies are not designated as a direct integration of the story, but it is a disgrace when making a movie that has absolutely little or no connection. I want the director and / or screenwriter to have done his research on this topic. All this film does is create a forum for hatred between people while creating a rift that should not be there. This film depicted the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor house, while the third group (Hindus) looked as if they did not exist in the brutal killings of the population of both nations. The inaccuracies combined with the wound's disrespect for one's beliefs portrayed by 'Gian Singh' were a disgrace to the highest format. Although a more positive note, the actors did a good job in their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve C played their rolls exceptionally. I hope those who see this movie cannot see or use it as a template for the current historical event.
