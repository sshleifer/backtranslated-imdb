Although the film has a pretty stylish look for an indie made on a very low budget, it's not what I'm going to film for. There wasn't a sign I found sympathetic to, they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers. Everything they try ends up badly, it's too hopeless for me. Reviews refers to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. When Josh talks to girl friend Emily about her brother, he almost thinks Rhett doesn't play with a full deck. Nevertheless, Josh performs a "wedding" for Rhett, and a woman, Rhett, met just a few hours before. There were a few interesting notions of some of the signs that had come along the way. But for me it was most telling that people went out of the movie ... and I saw it at a free screening.
