This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography does not fit into the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job by screwing up the rest. People just don't act like this in real-life situations. My question is: Who would finance such a crap? <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some miners falling into a mining shaft after a firefighter fails to save them. Then we go with some cyclists in a forest that runs around making bumps on their bikes. A guy falls and breaks his leg or something. The fireman comes to help them. In the meantime someone starts a fire. Some more bike points. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
