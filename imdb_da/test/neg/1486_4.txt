There was a good build-up of tension all the way through. The kinematics were surprisingly good considering such a minimal budget. We are witnessing occasional spells of good acting, but it is quickly deflated by some rather cheesy lines. Understandably, there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had, sitting on trees while a crocodile stalked you. Silence would have been golden here. There could have been a bigger game of excitement than the weak draw: "I was in the closet for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me that there is a slight difference in getting a blow from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. You decide. Throughout the movie I can't seem to find a connection or for that matter, sympathy with the characters, maybe because they don't develop one in the whole movie, which character is. There are some occasionally good scares when the crocodile sneaks up the characters, overshadowed by some dubious scenes. In one case, we need to be afraid of an ear floating in the water, but later we sit next to a decapitated, noisy play and only worry about a broken finger. A particular roller coaster of a movie when it comes to logic.
