Snakes on a Train starts as the Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) & Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the boarder in the US, they go so illegally on a seventeen hour train to Los Angeles. Alma's family, however, did not approve of her & Brujo's relationship and put an old black magic curse on her that transforms all her insider into snakes, is not life a b * tch? As the snakes lean out of Alma's mouth and escape to other parts of the train, they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual suffering ... Edited and led by Mallachi Brothers (although IMDb claims that it is only a guy who uses a pseudonym, Peter Mervis) one must say that I thought Snakes on a Train was crap, it's as simple as it really is. It seems that the whole movie was created and made for cash on Samuel L. Jackson's slick Snakes on a Plane (2006) by all horror fans at least favorite production company Asylum, specializing in ripping off big budget Hollywood flicks & the like Money and film making is no more clear than here with Snakes on a Train, which makes a movie just because the title rhymes with a more successful movie is not a good starting point. The script by Eric Forsberg is bad, for a start Snakes on a Plane was fun, while Snakes on a Train is much more serious, and when you actually break it down and look at it, it should have been much more light hearted. In fact, it would probably have worked better as a Scary Movie (2000) type spoof. You know something I'm struggling to find a positive thing to say about snakes on a train, it's so bad. For a start, the character is bad and it is impossible to emote with anyone, the story is absolutely horrible and makes no sense (if people spit all the little snakes up, where did the big ones come from? Why did Alma go to the big snake at the end? Why How did he stop the train when it reached Los Angeles? Where did the typhoon come from at the end?), it takes too seriously, the first twenty-seven minutes are so boring and unintentional, I am surprised that I was awake and it's just a very, very bad movie at virtually every level. Director Mervis has only a few train wagons, all of which look pretty much the same The film becomes very repetitive and boring to see. There is hardly any blood or gore, there are some snakes borrowing under few people's skin, someone being shot and it's about it. The special effects are also bad, the huge CGI snake at the end is really awful and at least said better. It's not scary, there's zero atmosphere and it's a bit of a drill from start to finish. The real living snakes are also a problem, they are just as fat and non-threatening. If you look at a scene with a real snake and an actor, the snakes never make any movement toward them or act aggressively and actually seem to always be in the opposite direction. Shots in California Technically, the movie is, of course, low budget and it shows is basically looking because it is. The act is not great, not that the actor gets any kind of material to work with. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Train is bad, I'm sorry, but that's how I feel, and I don't quite know how to describe it otherwise. I really can't see what anyone would get out of seeing snakes on a train, it's really that bad.
