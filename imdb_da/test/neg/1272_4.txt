And again I find myself in the minority. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this one. This is the only Varney work I have not embraced, including know-how. Slam Dunk Ernest rewards the credit for being the worst of the line, but this is a clear competitor for the dubious title. <br /> <br /> This work is too rough and also to be lovable. Legality was one of Ernest's key components, and this element was completely lost in it. Unfortunately, most people, unfortunately, think this is the best of the line, but if you loved the essence of what Ernest, Ernest, you will realize what I refer to in fifteen minutes into this work. It was too blatant to be fun. <br /> <br /> It bets on a 3.5 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
