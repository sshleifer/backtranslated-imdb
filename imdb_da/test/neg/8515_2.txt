I give it two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time tonight, and that's the first "Road" image I've seen. I wawaaay waited better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of Road movies. If that's true, I don't have to bother to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has many songs in the first half, but it is balanced with only one production number with dance throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie. Neither Hope nor Crosby came across all that well, their characters were not so charming, the movie was not fun at all, most of the dialogue was just lame filler, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much play. br /> <br /> The movie wasn't what I expected. I was expecting more "Road" but there is not much. They do it quickly to the palace and then most of the movie goes there until the end. I also expect much more from the famous "road" style to break the fourth wall, where the characters speak directly to the audience or comment on the plot. There were only about 4 cases of it. One of them is an example of the non-funny humor in this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope resumes the plot so far to Crosby) Crosby: I know all that! Hope: Yes, but the people who came halfway through the picture do not. Crosby: You think they missed my song? <br /> <br /> There are two weak punchlines, but at least they are actually jokes. Much of the rest of the script doesn't even have any jokes. An example is: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirect call Hope a rat). It's not fun at all, it hardly qualifies as a joke, but it's the kind of non-joke dialogue that carries most of the movie. Many of the scenes don't even come close to a joke, just using generic uninteresting dialogue like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, what are you gonna do for me? Do you think you can just throw me to the dogs? Hope: Well why not, did you do it for me, didn't you? Crosby: Yeah, but that's because I was out for us. You don't look to anyone. Hope: Oh yes? So why did I pay for the check? <br /> <br /> (The above is just from my memory. It's not accurate, but it illustrates you what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just generic dialogue with no jokes at all. <br /> <br /> My class: Waste of time.
