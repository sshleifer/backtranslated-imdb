This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I hadn't been to the cinema, my two young cousins ​​(who also thought it was disappointing but not as terrible as I thought) would have left the cinema. There were two points in the movie that I almost laughed at, but the rest of it was either boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a spear on all superhero movies (which I love), but it was basically based on Spiderman, with some oblique references to other superheroes like Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can't think of a good thing to say about this movie. Don't waste your money with this movie - there are many other better movies out there!
