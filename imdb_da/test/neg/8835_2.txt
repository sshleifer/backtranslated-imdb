I have no idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western. Or how a commentator said the plot was more coherent than most. Nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is a great non-sequitur! It is a front end for the noble B-western movies of the 30s. I've seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst. <br /> <br /> The bad guy is known as The Shadow - to cry aloud! Initially, The Shadow scheme holds the pages on the stage. At the same time, his gang rustles the entire cattle on the territory. Then they decide to move on to bank robbery. To do this, they have to shoot up with a machine gun - no explanation as to why it is necessary or how he got the little toy! <br /> <br /> No single scheme is revealed in sufficient detail to suggest a plot here. The shadow is, of course, just a generally poor guy with all sorts of common evil schemes. <br /> <br /> He gives his instructions to his gang through a false warranty. (Knock-knock, who's there?) He's apparently clairvoyant, because when his henchmen need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, security opens and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can only imagine that he has met them face to face and says, "I have some secret scary instructions to give you our next evil act - meet me on the wall and I give you.") Just why The shadow requires the security to communicate with his army of criminals as most of the elements of this mess never explained. <br /> <br /> He has a beautiful tunnel to the oil's hollow stump across the street from which vantage point various of his evil do murder. He also has a hidden panel NOT in his secret lair behind the false safe, but out in the main room. <br /> <br /> When he is not behind the security team, he hangs out on his co-smaller ranch, masking ranches Matlock. We learn that he has murdered the ranch's true owners - two brothers - and assumed the identity of one. The late brother's daughter has recently arrived from the 1930s NYC (judging by her wardrobe) and she apparently never met her real uncle because he also doubts her! <br /> <br /> If you thought evil boys always had black hats and good boys white hats, you should watch this movie. Here the good guys are hitting their hats in favor of white headbands that make them look like they've all suffered head wounds before shots have been fired! It's like a game of pick-up basketball - only Wayne has them tying bandanas around their heads instead of just wearing their shirts. Perhaps it is the strangest of all. Immediately after the shadow and his gang were subdued, we jump far into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the front niece) on their porch. (Don't forget that there has been little romance.) Yak plays with Waynes 3-4 year old son, dressed in Injun garb! (Hiyoo, skookum fun!) <br /> <br /> No, thanks to this nonsense, Wayne continued to become a screen legend. Only a superstar (packages or not!) Could overcome this record in a movie CV. Long live the Duke!
