Without a shadow of doubt, this is and will probably always be the worst movie I have ever had the accident of seeing my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who were thrown out of acting because they were such a tree that someone sat on them and thought they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Add a cheap video camera. You know the old VHS types that cost Â£ 20 on eBay. Add a horrible story without effects and yes you have this movie. What a shocker it was. They couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. In fact, I've seen it all since I couldn't believe this crap was ever funded. <br /> <br /> MISS ALL COSTS
