Wow, what a bad movie. Not scary at least and hardly understandable. The reason is not interconnected, and the play is terrible. What is the line from a famous critic? "She runs the emotional spectrum from A to B." Yup. It sums it up. Not even good at camp value! I didn't expect Oscar material, but this? And gosh, her friend is a ghost? You will have to get the IQ of particularly stupid molluscs not to see it coming. <br /> <br /> This movie (and I use the word solved) is an insult to the film-making public. If only someone involved in it knew how to string the story together! This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing lower. On the bright side - at least it's not a full two hours long.
