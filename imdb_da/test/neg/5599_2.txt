OK if you're looking for a fun lesbian romp. This is NOT the movie If you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the sham's delusions or 'wild things') this is NOT the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian traitor's movie. This is NOT the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking to waste an hour in your life, it's your movie. It's badly written, badly directed, badly scored, poorly filmed. It had bad special effects ... I mean really bad special effects. I think you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol. It's really a beautiful bad movie. The actors were classic starlet beauties, but resembled more porn stars. It's shot like a soft core pornography, but you never get money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains. The "girl in girl scenes" who sucks btw was so LAME that there is almost no worth mentioning. go see the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube cos that's the only reason you want to watch the movie and not even worth it. <br /> <br /> A waste of money and time !!! not even pick it up, instead of "crazy intentions 2" instead - the same movie without the bad special effects, bad story, bad writing, poor dialogue and bad acting. in fact, I might see it now just to clean my mind
