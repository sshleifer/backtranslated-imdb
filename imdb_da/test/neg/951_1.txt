Since this show was changed from TSS (screen savers) to AOTS (attack by the show), it has gone downhill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. Did the show get amazing, then they were fired by the TSS for unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers and more about games and magazines. It also promoted bands that no one had heard of or cared for. Finally, I couldn't see it anymore when Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went out to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online podcasts and shows on the REV 3 network. Check it out. REV3.com I think you can get to that by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go see Kevin Roses show or listen to the White podcast. <br /> <br /> J <
