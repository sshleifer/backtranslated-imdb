About your horrible movie copying Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to see every film made about any composer, and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it's a horrible combination of empty over the top feelings combined with the worst taste possible. You've proven it in your horrible b-movie. The only thing that carries the film is the music. Of course, you did not disturb to look beyond the good, but in my taste distinct notions of the Tackacs Quartet, but OK, I must admit that the performance at least has quality as contrast to the movie you made. It begins with the dying DEAF Beethoven, who perfectly understands Anna, who just whispers. Beethoven's hearing during the film is getting better at the moment, but it must be because of something vague divine. Then there is the completely impossible half-pornographic "eye-white closed" double-sided scene that is completely over the top with the delicious Anna and the weeping nephew finally (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my GOD what a performance). And as a culmination, rip-off from Amadeus, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes, but in total nonsense, she opposes perfectly, but no one else in your audience even educated professional musicians will understand. Of course, your reaction will be that a negative answer is at least an answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself turns to his grave because of your worthless creation and reason. This so-called tribute is blasphemy and I am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made, even though it is about my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you cannot understand Beethoven's greatness in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a few lessons in performing and playing the violin. It's trouble with you Americans: You think you can understand everything yourself when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yes, we can do that anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard work, talent, devotion and professionalism. All this is you creators of Copying Beethoven missing. We are seen in kindergarten.
