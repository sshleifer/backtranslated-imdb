Without them we would not see anything other than the Spielberg Farrelly brothers and the movies based on old sitcoms. They are the risk managers. They reap the benefits of success and suffer the mistakes. Max and Grace are definitely a mistake. Credit is earned by Michael Parness to get out there and do his first job as he claims he drove him to bankruptcy. He may be better off on stage if this movie is an indication of what to expect in the future. Although everyone warned me, I went to see Max and Grace anyway, and hoped I could discover something they didn't. It starts well enough, a party for Max in his parents' house shot in warm muted light, the camera floating into interesting angles. As soon as we see, Max has hanged himself, an obvious rip-off of Harold and Maude, it all goes straight into the mind. How could he make it unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? How can two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do so with the blessings of all parties involved? In Q&A after the movie David Krumholtz suggested the whole story, the surreal dream of his character was Max. This story is so poorly written that the comment sounded more like an excuse. The movie doesn't look like it was made on a shoestring, the more reason to be so disappointed with the results. What is thought of as fun is not, but instead is aggressively bad. The continuity is sloppy, the lighting is terrible, and the effects look cheap and forced. BPH seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full, but I saw at least thirty or forty walkouts within the first half hour. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, commits her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same since I never go out before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks this is "one of the best scripts" he has ever read, it sounds like he should catch up on his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independent I've seen since Bubba-Ho tep.
