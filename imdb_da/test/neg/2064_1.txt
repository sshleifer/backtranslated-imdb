Saw this on French TV today and was most disappointed! The movie starts reasonably well, but nothing is illuminated, and at the end we are no longer ahead than at the beginning. Regarding seeing the man for the murder of his wife, it's just not plausible. You need tangible evidence to judge a person and a minimum of evidence. In this case there is none at all, so it's just not plausible. Remember the old saying "innocent until it has become guilty". The fact that a woman has disappeared without a trace is no proof that her husband killed her. So I really don't know what kind of point this movie was trying to make. The result is completely illogical and incomprehensible, and no incriminating evidence has been revealed to the spectator. So, frankly, seeing it is a complete waste of time. After all, a movie must be entertaining .... this is completely untrue in the case of this, and I suggest it be irrevocably shipped to the trash bin where it belongs!
