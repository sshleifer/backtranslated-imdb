These 3-hour TV mini-TVs came home from us from Blockbuster's weekend. The production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (especially Bridget Fonda) and special effects (including a large Jim Henson speaks polar bears & reindeer). They should have spent a little more money getting a coherent script. The story was so loose that it never really came together. One can overlook Irish-acclaimed Germans, but not heraldic storytelling. With meaningless loose ends, which contained a special guest growth in the devil, this is certainly not intended to be a Christmas classic. A shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.
