Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (whether racist, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Latin teen boys are stupid, hairy, non-artistic and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic girls sex-crazed, easy, ass-baring sluts? Will all black people start fighting and carry weapons? Do all homosexuals party parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? Are all white teenage girls rich, firm princesses bored by white teenage boys and looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, you are my friend a bigot and you will love Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audience (I was 15 years old the first time I saw children and I think that's why I'm still a virgin), but wassup rockers are not shocking ?? It's just bad. He is trying to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialogue and body-hair close-ups, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Put simply, Wassup Rockers is a teenage boy's fantasy. Which 14-year-old boy will not be a skater who comes into trouble, crashes parties, drinks the 40s and is told by the warm, rich, white girl that his uncircumcised penis "looks dangerous?" Besides the demographic, I really don't know who will enjoy this movie.
