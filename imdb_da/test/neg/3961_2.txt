The dog can act ... unfortunately no one else is in the casting of this sordid faux child movie. An apostate, yet very clever, dog sees itself in the lives of two motherless children, much to the fate of their bitter and cold father. In what can only be termed Dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children - who may or may not be mentally challenged --- to play with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obey. Soon the children will be kidnapped, and Benji will help the police find them. It is only when the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience seems to have played the weak Eb on GREEN ACRES is one of the kidnappers. Unfortunately, Deborah Walley does not do so. Walley's former screen triumphs include the BEACH BLANK BINGO and it made it a BIKINI WORLD. She has also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past, and here she tries to wipe out her girl's reputation by playing it badly! <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM BENJI ... he is a dog and this movie is a dog!
