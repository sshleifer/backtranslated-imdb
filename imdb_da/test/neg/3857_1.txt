I can't believe there are people out there who voted 10 for this waste! Have any of you accessed a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtedly being held or is there a special colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned, which I do not know? <br /> <br /> If I were to say what I was really thinking about this movie, none of it would be published. <br /> <br /> Initially, its 'star' is a no-talent idiot that seems like a bad imitator by Jim Carrey, who has hoovered enough angel up on his nose to revive the Sahara desert. His name will be a total guarantee that I will not see a future movie with him in it - even though he plays a rock hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> With regard to the 'plot'. One more crime we can criticize for the Nazis is that they were so horrible that they could be considered fair game as "evil people" in tripe like this; just criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in trice. For the people who made this movie - Stop making movies and if not then limit yourself to advertising where your efforts will finally have a depth of being fleeting in duration. Finally a criticism of IMDB - Why don't you have the opportunity to vote 'Zero' for a movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this tripe I have to vote twice zero or something.
