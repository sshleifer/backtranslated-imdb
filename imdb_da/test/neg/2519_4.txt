OK, it's a strange movie! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the "inventive" engineer director George Barry utilizes, like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. He can make a crack in the wall for a plot unit! There is more humor than horror here, but I found it an uneven mix. You will laugh and cry and probably wonder why you have your hands on this. Barry explains in the introduction that the film began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of $ 10,000. It's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage 70's "gore", you can find this an irresistible and freaky snack.
