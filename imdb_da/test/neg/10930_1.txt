This movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. A woman "The EX" pretends to be a number of people to access her former husband. Kill people without reason in prayer to reach her goals. The women I don't believe ever went to the play school. She just uses the whole movie to make stupid expressions, and she seems to be trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking at the camera. Errors on most occasions. She makes friends with her former spouse's wife and son, she does it to use them against her husband. Only when you see this movie do you think "Ex" wants to kill his former husband, perhaps because he has treated her in a bad way. But actually the women are obsessed with the man and want him back. The two of them used to enjoy uneven entertainment (using the whip of course). My advice to the public is not to buy this movie, do not rent this movie and do not see it as I did (at 15:00 on FOX)
