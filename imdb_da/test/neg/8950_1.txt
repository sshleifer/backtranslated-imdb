This series is formal and boring. The sections are the same every week, just with slightly varied settings. Some wicked character does something trembling, Walker goes after him, and it ends up in a karate fight. The bad guys are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good ones are all clean, honest and saintly, and the lines of history are simplistic and unrealistic. After approx. 2 episodes will be the show completely unmanageable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norri's best work. His other work may be cliché, but it usually does not take weeks. If you enjoy formal, boring, repetitive klichéd snooze fests then this is for you.
