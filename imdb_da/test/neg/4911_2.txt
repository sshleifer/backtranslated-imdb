weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is there in the movie world in the first place? She tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin), but couldn't impress. <br /> <br /> music was not that impressive, only a song "jhalak dikhlajaa" was worth listening to ..... <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? well they tried to justify the title of the movie eventually, but it didn't make sense .. <br /> <br /> there were many unwanted phrases in the story which made it more boring. But if someone is a Dino Morea fan, go ahead and see it.
