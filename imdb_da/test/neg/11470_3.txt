I try desperately to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes to walk. If it gets better, I'll come back here and let you know, but somehow I doubt it will happen. Solomon Kane seems to be based on the Dark Watch video game, and it sounds like it is based on the video games Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately it's not true either. I hear it is based on some comics or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that I have never heard of, but what it is based on, there is nothing original in this eerie boring movie. The atmosphere is stolen from the movie 300, which wasn't that big at first. The boring overactivation takes itself so seriously that it is almost hypnotic, and to be clear I understand it in a bad way. The reason is practically non-existent: violent guy trying to be nonviolent encounters friendly family, friendly family being murdered, violent guy being violent again. All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes, or whatever, just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash wizardry movie that you have seen and there you have it. Someone, somewhere, said that's how to make a movie: Use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add lots of slow motion shots of horseshoes sprayed in creepy puddles, add snowflakes that hovering around, while two boring characters speak to each other and oh yes rain is raining down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is happening, and don't forget the black silhouettes that go towards us with the fire blazing behind them, and lots of torches are burning and, of course, blurry fighting situations underneath as it is not clear what actually happens because we do not have the budget for the gory special effects so just throw in the sound of metal clanking, and oh, by the way, don't let any characters live long enough for the audience to understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them and cross their fingers, hope that fans of swords and turkish movies will eat it up, even if it is done doo doo and go straight to video, do not pass the GO. . .
