This film is much the same as the Cannibal Holocaust. If it was not for the unnecessary animal to kill in the name of "shock" ("Ooh look at us, we are hardcore, we have added real death to our movie") these movies would make their way on my dusty classics shelf - I am a great fan of cannibal movies and zombies. But, as it stands, it is another example of fear of shock that relates to the last straps of the pile in a desperate effort to get a bad movie to generate more hype. In summary, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal. A fan of the 70's should give this a try, but anyone with modern ethics and taste should choose something a little better written for their popcorn party.
