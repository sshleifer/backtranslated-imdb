Well, Totally and Terror is a little below average in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some lap in this movie, but it's pretty slow and the play, in my opinion, is mostly subpar, though I think Steve James does a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theater at the end of the film instead of following Norri's girlfriend. Until then, the killer had only killed women. Oh, I think it wasn't as predictable as I thought. Finally a movie you can pass on.
