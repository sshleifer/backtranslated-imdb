The intertwined views may come up as a good idea in some movies. Here it is a total mess. <br /> <br /> But the overall mess begins with the story: A video clip bummy wants to shoot a light comedy with a damaging noir-like female character. She is beautiful and no men can resist diving and crawling and sucking their toes. She is even more materialistic and looks like butter does not melt in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The film melts away in its own pretentiousness: being smart / fun / beautiful. Phalocretinism at its best. Only white waste, please.
