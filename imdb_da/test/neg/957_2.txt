POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I was looking forward to seeing them together, being married and all I wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. Okay, that said, I guess they're actors, their off-screen relationship didn't have to pervade their performances, especially with this script. How stupid a professor can be to stick to someone. I can't remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his leading lady, probably in a more inevitable way. If I were "bound" to someone, I would be pretty angry. The evening I would have surely disappeared quickly. Me didn't even show a little annoyance just a little surprise. Dennis was going to kick me and scream. The whole part of the movie was so awful - especially me had to go to the toilet (# 2) between the dumpsters in the dark at night. Ewww. No f **** ing way! <br /> <br /> What's with Dennis socking every suspect in the movie. So first ask questions later. Not once, not twice but too many times - I could have spoken if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad it couldn't have been more of the plot. The assumed drama outside the screen that leads to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting from Dex's quest. <br /> <br /> My fault lies with the author of this manuscript. Unless the director and others doctored it so much that it cannot be recognized. <br /> <br /> I don't even want to get into the real reason that poor Dex was murdered. How ridiculous it is. Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the explanation was explained (a true "film noir" moment) everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (gab) "Dex himself says this is a silly reason for a triple murder. Oh the excitement you could cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If anyone than Dennis had been in this movie, I would must give it 1/2 star (only because I really have seen worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars .. For Dennis and Meg stars, see something else.
