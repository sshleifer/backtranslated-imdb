This shows how terrible the WB network was in the last few years of its existence. As a homeschooler, of course, I regret this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes that the kids are "strange hippies who are so clever that they are alienated from the super-cold high school students". Sorry TV authors, the world seen from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show) are NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality. As for those who actually liked this show ... please, dear sweet Jesus, think about the claim that you actually liked this shed over a very long walk. The action is even more hollow, fake and wood than the stereotypes the whole show was built around. Thanks WB for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its start-to-end misery. This show never, ever should ever have had the privilege of being made, no less has as much as eight horrible episodes. I really hope that these actors eventually got a clue and stopped playing roles in rubbing TV shows like this as soon as this show ended.
