This movie has been done before. It's basically an unoriginal combo of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives." There are some fun pieces, but otherwise it's a clich√© drill. It is a good first film attempt, and the director (who also steals in and wrote the function) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other movies. The action, however, was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to watch gay-themed movies not be so rubbish with political correctness and tired stories of anxiety. The protagonist seemed pretty well adjusted for a gay teen in rural Texas, so no saccharin coming out drama here!
