I have no idea who these others are, but this movie is simply awful. They have to supply Joe Pesci when he is a minor character. Bait and change movies, as did the studies with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I watched, "This fuzzy gem is about JOe Pesci's MOB character, which is a hothead starting a war" etc. Joe plays The part of Joe, he doesn't even carry a gun, plays a whimpy character and gets SPOILER - (whacked). So much for the movie that revolves around Pesci. The only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy as they passed gas while waiting for a score. If you see this movie after reading this, I warned you. Please stop and do not lose 87 minutes in your life.
