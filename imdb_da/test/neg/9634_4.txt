HANDS OF RIPPER <br /> Image Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian physician (Eric Porter) uses newly found freudian analysis on a young girl (Angharad Rees), who turns out to be the daughter of Jack the Ripper, and just as deadly ... Unlikely Hammer horror, where a respectable social figure takes responsibility for a beautiful young waif without attracting as much as a scandal, even when she takes to murder everything with a series of deadly tools (broken mirrors, hatpins, etc.)! L. W. Davidson's manuscript seamlessly wanders from one murder to another and sacrifices the material's subtitle (Porter's obvious attraction for Rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued throughout. Some of the live scenes are surprisingly alive, even for Hammer, and these were cut from the original US release (despite an MPAA R-rating), although the full version is now available on home video. Porter and Rees provide excellent performances, and the climax of St. Paul's Cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is odd hole and inaccessible. Directed by Peter Sasdy.
