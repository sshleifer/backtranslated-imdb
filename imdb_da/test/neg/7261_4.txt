Something strange happens in remote areas of the Arctic. An air force station has been found destroyed, its residents are missing. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing vessel disappears. Curious tracks are found in the snow. A four-foot piece of living organism is found near a broken aircraft. The piece resembles half the itch of a giant Alaskan crab. The military (Craig Stevens as Air Force Officer) and its experts are astounded. A prominent scientist (William Hopper) and his beautiful assistant (Alix Taltan) are summoned from New York. Hopper comes from this tiny proof that they are dealing with a monstrous prayer man. He's right The beautiful assistant happens to look out the window in the office and see the hideous face with its rolling eyebrows staring at her. She drops what she wears, claps her hands to her cheeks and screams in horror. Mantis begins flying south along the Gulf Stream and pauses again and again to attack large population centers such as Washington and New York to overthrow buses and people. Military weapons have no influence on it, but eventually Stevens crashes into it in his jetfighter and kills the death animal who comes to earth and occupies the Manhattan Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, who has survived the collision, leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big mistake with "3RG mines" despite the harsh look, threatening behavior and earthquake roar. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper chuckles and takes their picture. <br /> <br /> Ho hum. <br /> Like the deadly mantis themselves, formally this time pledging and gasping for air, flopping around, looking like swapping people, but nothing at all in the way of a fresh or original idea. As it is, they overlooked a clich√©. Hopper should have hastily invented a Super Duper DDT who could only defeat the insect. That is what the 3RG mines should have been filled with, rather than ordinary explosives. The model work is pretty good considering what the budget should have been. Not much money could have been spent on anything else because everything else is pretty routine. Craig Stevens is bland, a face and a style made for a television series. William Hopper looks equally tall and silver-haired - but his instrument has only one note. The beautiful assistant is quite common, considering her role. The section calls for Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They also could not act but brought with them small but distinct hints of molarity. Something would have helped this fagged-out movie. <br /> <br /> I wish the deadly mantis hadn't roared so loudly and so often because you can't roar - you can't even whisper - if you don't have lungs. However, I didn't mind when the monster met his death in the tunnel. A bean mantis is a graceful insect in its own spindle way, and it's nice to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and what not. But when you come right down to it, they are not very appealing. The man's mantis are smaller and weaker than the woman, as in humans, and when the couple is almost copulating, the woman bites her head from the cock, as in humans. But at least human men know when to stop. The man's mantis continues to replicate for several minutes, even though he is now without a head. We humans do not have mindless men who copulate with goal-driven women. Do we?
