I recently spoke 8 ?? by going to see this movie in the cinema. It was a waste of time, and the only feeling you get out of the theater is a bit of a nausea of ​​all the nasty social pornography. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if it had a totally absurd twist, but it didn't, it was just awful with maybe one or two scenes that could have been taken out and made for much nice short film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I was thinking about is the way the director uses all Finish stereotypes as characters. It's quite extraordinary how you as a Finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. It was sad to sit and hear the audience sit and laugh at things they thought were typical Finish, but generally only make people fun.
