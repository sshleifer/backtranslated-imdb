I had great hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD "In American Cake and Animal ..." After having gone through this I realized I was just blowing $ 2.50 to rent it. This movie started slowly and became slower ... brief and fleeting moments of life showed that it was in the spirit of American Pies if you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or fun! Don't be fooled as I was and expect something that can hardly be seen because this movie will hit you more than entertaining you. "Must fill three more lines for this stupid movie that does not deserve the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorant crud. This movie collapsed, even the short nudity sucked!
