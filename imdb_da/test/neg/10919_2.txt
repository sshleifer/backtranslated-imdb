I'm writing this with 10 minutes left before the movie is finished. I am happy to write it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film will end. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is simple enough, amassed dog loose in a small town, killing people. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80's horror. <br /> <br /> Uhh .. no. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell it, shouldn't have been really adapted to movies, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz it's boring! The first 45 minutes try to build the depth to the protagonists and create excitement. However, it lasts too long (half of the movie!) - the characters are unlikeable, and we never care for them, and it creates almost no excitement. The easiest movie (according to plot and time) to compare this to the classic Jaws. Everything Jaws does right makes Cujo wrong. Jaws created good characters and a true sense of fear. Cujo does not. Jaws effectively create a scary, spooky villain in his shark. Cujo has a filthy St. Bernard running around ditch and jumping, and not much else. Jaws are exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless drilling that remains predictable right to the end. <br /> <br /> Also confusing is the abundance of partial plates that just seem like boring red herring to the film's main drawing. <br /> <br /> If this movie was rewritten to the big screen and had a better instructor, it could have been good. But it was not. It was a waste of 90 minutes in my life. People here say this is one of the best King adaptations - I'm sorry you couldn't be more wrong. The mist is a hundred times better, Thinner is 10 times better and even the one with cats is twice as good! This is, in my opinion, one of the worst! The only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real, even though they were boring. The films ended now and it didn't get any better. Avoid.
