1. Watched 19-19-2003 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculous lame 3D movie that largely follows the plot of many 80-year-old teenagers. Stupid kids go to a known murderous campsite, be chased by an unknown masked man, and then we try to find out who, if anyone wants to live. We really don't care who's behind the mask, but even it's not hard to find out if you've seen any of these movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite some decent 3D effects.
