This film's only redeeming factor was that it was free on television and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Apart from that, Hallmark must reassess this sharing of their empire and perhaps keep their film more oriented towards bizarre love relationships between cancer-affected haemophilia in Mississippi. Going into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it to be memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of seeing what is vampire (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing. Anyone who worked on the duplication of this movie should be moved to another community group ... maybe food service to the deaf. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem to be Oscar-worthy of thought. Then again, if you actually ended up with this movie's profile, I imagine it might be too late ...
