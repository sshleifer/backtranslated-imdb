This was the worst movie I had ever seen. Visuals were so dang chopped it made me dizzy. I constantly hated zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent black and white to color switch. I also thought the story had no meaning whats ever, and it was another clich√©d Action Movie, with a quite a bad guy and a few hostages. I could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? I can keep it stable, something the director couldn't do. Over all, really the worst I have ever seen, you thought Disney was bad? I didn't even disturb to see it all, because I'm sure I could guess the outcome, and the visual was the worst I have ever seen.
