As a kids movie, it's great. For the family it just sucks. I really hoped for something like Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This movie was just aimed at the kids with the stupid script and characters calling each other small names as booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was, however, a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka with this movie ... just because there is a theme song that looks like the Willy Wonka song, this movie doesn't make anything like Willy Wonka.
