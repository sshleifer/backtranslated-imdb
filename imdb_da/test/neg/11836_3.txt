A gut-ripping baby T-Rex is loose in a small western city, whereby the sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who goes through her role in a very uninteresting way) to get to the bottom of things. They discover that a mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen) is unfamiliar with the government sponsorship and continues with a long-abandoned US research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (ha!) By setting up an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground laboratory facility. Before long, our heroes are trapped inside, the marines are called, the flow goes out and dinos are free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on. Despite an often scary script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this direct-to-video copy of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is quite digestible garbage, thanks to good production values, passable FX, occasional laughs and lots of brainless action. <br /> <br /> Someone pointed out that an opening scene in this movie was stolen from CARNOSAUR, but who used to watch Roger Corman's production know that he allows directors to reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money. <br /> <br /> Result: 3 out of 10
