To rewrite the previous reviewer's comments if you are a Stooges fan, avoid this at all costs! My basic question is that they are the experienced troops of comedy that Moe and Larry were, why they insisted on trying to continue the action as it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was clearly not interested in giving those serious writers and veteran comedy directors? This movie plays like a person who gives a pale imitation of the trio, and you can see how very hard Moe and Larry work to make every little slapstick relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his background in vaudeville, is just not up to the job of replacing Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If that is what Moe and Larry had left to choose from, they should just have closed the business and enjoy their retirement years. Leaving us fans with better memories of much better movies they had done earlier. Let them always laugh is the motto of comedy and always finish while you are at the top. Therefore, Seinfeld leaves sitcom while he is up there, instead of wandering around for the inevitable fall.
