This movie has some good ideas that others have pointed out but suffer (as others have pointed out, except those people who are apparently either the filmmaker's or cast's friends to otherwise explain why they would consider this a "10") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school's upholstery and excess plot. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half-hour episode, so there was no need to be an 88-minute movie. A perfect example of wasted material is the fast forward mounting in the first third of the film. Some of the back story is deserved, but too much time was spent on Daria character with anal sex boyfriend and on the back story of Paulie, who was not a realistic character, even though the actor did a decent job with lines he got. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateur parts: from typing fields of the typed material, to bad jumps and edits, bad camera positions, angles, light issues throughout and, most glaringly, a poorly written script with a poorly developed concept. If the author (also the director and the manager) had collaborated with someone, he might not have completed a 100% rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes, further rewarding someone's ability to truly believe in the people who gave it 10 on the rating system here .
