The plot of "Open Graves" is very simple. It's about a board game called Mamba, where players die in real life just as they die in the game. Delicious death scenes include killing via computer-generated crabs and snakes. The characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying, and there is not even a little bit of excitement. I liked Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but she's totally wasted and unmemorable here. The climax with CGI witch comes from the sea is completely ridiculous and silly. The only reason to see "Open Graves" is some interesting camera angles plus sexy Eliza Dushku. If such films are the future of horror, then I seriously give up. Give me some 70 or 80's low budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap.A generous 3 out of 10.
