This movie would be a great piece of history if it was actually a real movie of the Kennedy murder. There are far too many mistakes in this movie for me to point out. It's a movie of the Kennedy murder, but many of the important facts have been changed. Scenes are missing, and many of the scenes, after the President's limo passes the sign, do not fit. Both Kennedy's move noticeably slower than the other four people in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that don't fill up like Texas Gov. And his, along with the SS men in the front, lung forward, but you can see that the lime does not stop or slow down, actually it is accelerating. This movie is clearly an attempt to cover up.
