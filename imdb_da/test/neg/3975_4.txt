This movie is a mediocre, low budget flick. I've seen much worse on MST3K, let me assure you, but it's still a beautiful crappy movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clonus, a top secret governmental facility where clones are used to give organs to politicians. It is an almost Orwellian community, in fact: almost (but not entirely) effective. <br /> <br /> The movie starts rolling downhill when the main clone (Tim Connely of `Emergency 'fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen who appeared in this and at most four other films {and this was not her first movie}). They start to suspect something. After finding a beer cake in the nearby river, the plot begins to rave up. The clone receives no response from either the main researcher (Dick Sargent from `Bewitched ') or' Confessional ', a computer that probably knows everything so he breaks into the Clonus building and (in a scene hilariously destroyed by Mike and Bots ) finds out the truth (including a clone video that honestly shows the exact same method used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this movie was made twenty years ago ...) about Clonus. He breaks free, is pursued by two guards. He has a hell of a break through the two-foot fences, even though he has a much harder time climbing on some rocks. From there, it continues to slip. In addition, Peter Graves ('The Beginning of the End'), as Presidential Candidate and Keenan Wynn (`Dr. Strangelove ',' Piranha ',' Once Upon A Time In The West ') and Lurleen Tuttle (' Ma Barker's Killer Bread ' , 'Psycho' as the older couple who help Clony after he escapes. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was invaluable; one of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the movie; 10 for the MST3K version.
