Never before have I seen such a tale of such talented hangers become so ungrateful that their golden goose has not settled. These spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I was sad troy when he tried to join all his friends with Hollywood gigs, but as soon as things got angry, they left all the troy hanging. The night before was a vigorous effort for self-reliance resignation on a man who opposed the forces of Hollywood to preserve the integrity of history. The simple prerequisite for the night is to try to communicate the message, "look at this guy, he blew it all" when he actually has a strong underground successor, handled hard blows from friends and leaders all to get a project done that way , he imagined it. Honestly, the only productive couple that any of these guys played in the overall performance of the Boondock Saints shootout is culminating as nothing more than extra organs in the first bar-space scene, after all it did was whine why they didn't was a major deal based on the clambering of their rancid efforts on top of the troy's shoulders.
