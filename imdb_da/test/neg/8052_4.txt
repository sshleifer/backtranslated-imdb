I first saw Kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves. I remember when I hated both of them, and I never really bothered to see them again. <br /> <br /> However, I recently started a crusade to collect as many 80's cry titles in their original box form; it has been deleted for some time. I've got a really proud collection with many more titles on my list! <br /> <br /> Kindred, although I have not yet received a copy, has high priority as all the old movies I did not like back then, I own now and now have the review and think they are brilliant And the things I remember from Kindred are driving me now to get a copy of ASAP. Hurray for the 80s and long live horror!
