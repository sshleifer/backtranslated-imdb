Another Indian legend you've never heard of before is loose. As the name suggests, this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of humans while still using them. As usual, old burial grounds (can you say, "Poltergeist?") Have been disturbed by wise greedy land developers who build things. <br /> <br /> The CGI, if it had been better, could have made the effect more treacherous, but they shamed the budget and it shows - for comic effect. The released creature would probably have been kept out of the scene during its first several killings - it could have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere - but the monstrous instructor decided to show us in the first five minutes how it looks and it was not impressive. The deaths are just poorly finished, again with scary CGI. I suppose antiquity always kills by using cheap special effects. As for "victims", they look like they will laugh at every moment as they do stupid screams. It's always obvious who's going to get it: A character with few lines appears, strange sounds are heard, CGI dots fly, quit character. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> Still, there are a couple of hunting scenes with the monster actually doing this thing. Unfortunately, the director seems to use these as a device to fall back (so it is used too often) when he can't think of anything else for his characters to do. Overall, it's pretty stupid, but I've seen worse. This flick is cheap but it is oddly fun to see.
