I was also disappointed with this movie. To begin with, the things that are the case with him do not seem to me too terrible. (Excuse male chauvinist PoV). As mentioned by one of the judges: "Most men would be in your position". To which he responds "But this is not _my_ choice". OK, OK, fair point, so how bad was it really? Please inform us. But now the kicker: He doesn't know until the movie ends (invisible). Not his girlfriend, it's not the mentor, not the police, not anyone. Instead, he comes up with the brilliant plan for every girl he knows so he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his hunters. I thought he had just had enough unpleasant sex for the 12 days he was caught? Isn't it time to take a little break from all that? For me, his, to say the least, the ill-advised actions broke the "suspension of unbelief" of the film. I took a book out while I watched the last half hour out of the corner of my eye.
