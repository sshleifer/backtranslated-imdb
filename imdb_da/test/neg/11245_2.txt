As one of the victims of the entire Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say terrible? The script was so weak, using the cliche for the cliche. It seems as if the authors pieced this story along with a few articles about Enron. When we saw the film, we could honestly finish half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize that this was apparently adapted from a book, but was the book so bad? I don't know what to say. Just awful. The best part about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth actually kept her clothes on. Apart from that, this movie becomes a great fat F.
