It is amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie anxiety film was actually made in the first place. The signs are so weak, and it seems so uninspired that it's impossible to worry about any of them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to fast forward along the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you would rather rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion."
