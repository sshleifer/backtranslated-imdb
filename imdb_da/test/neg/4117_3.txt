Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script a little space. <br /> <br /> I also understand the notion that by changing only one variable, you can potentially change the way history unfolds. <br /> <br /> What I do not understand, however, is the way in which change in time unfolds. We are exposed to a number of "timewaves", which gradually retrograde planetary development. Although this is a practical plot unit as it gives our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it makes no sense at all. Surely, if you change a variable and that variable has significant or even completely changed planetary evolution, then when you "come back to the future", the evolutionary process is already established and there would be no need for waves? Why would a change that happened 65 million years ago wait until now to be effective? The fact that the mill was projected ahead of time can give it some credibility, but it has changed significantly millions of years ago, and it was a change in evolutionary history that did not depend on a return to our present day . <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable from ever happening. By doing so successfully, we see that evolution has never happened and no one remembers the events themselves! What works for the solution should probably work for the original change? I like a good bursting sci adventure, but unless it is set "in a galaxy far far away", it must at least have a foundation in theoretical opportunity to make it truly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Good premise, poor plot, fair action and in fairness just a twist on Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "see again" list.
