Having watched the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker, I found out why the movie bombed the way it did. The filmmakers had no point in calling the movie "8MM 2." Originally the movie was called "The Velvet Side of Hell", but was changed at the last minute by Sony Pictures to 8MM 2 without letting the filmmakers have anything to say in the case. By doing so, they screwed them out of theatrical releases and sentenced them to a straightforward video release with minimal advertising. Again, this is from the filmmaker's mouth, not mine, so I really can't say what's truth and what's hype. <br /> <br /> Looking at the movie as "Velvet Side of Hell", it's not that bad. It's not good, but it's not god terrible. It would basically just be a B movie that likes to show breasts. But as a successor to "8MM" the movie fails terribly.
