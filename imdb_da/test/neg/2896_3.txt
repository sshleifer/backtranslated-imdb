I am also an SF buff, among other genres, and I particularly like the 60's and 70's movies with their "effects over" priority, producing so many intelligent and tasteful stories that were put on the screen. In a nutshell, I totally agree with Scott 886's review of this movie. I've heard about this movie, and that's what I mentioned earlier, a 60s and 70s SF buff, with a penchant for SF stories with the touch of the "Twilight Zone" I expected a lot and my expectations was enhanced with reviews that ranked the effects of this movie "second best" to Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey". What a scam. "Journey to the far side of the sun" was plain, distorted, half-baked, silly movie with scary amateur special effects (and I remember loving movies from the era and despising CGI) and it can be fully compared to 60 SF disasters as "Marooned", as "Journey" much reminded me. The idea behind it all is not that bad, but builds the plot on a story about a twin plane to Earth, where the same world is reversed, asking for a master like Kubrick to lead. Needles to say Robert Parish is nothing like that, so he delivered boring and stupid movies that looked and felt like a matinee television series of those days. Not worth wasting your time even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
