Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. After using the same stories over and over again, new Directors-General finally come up with different ideas. Of course, this does not mean that they are all great. I think Okul is one of them. It must be a scary movie, but it's not. Nor does it succeed in being scary. So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is quite annoying with the teacher role. I'm sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Perhaps concentrate on a topic like making it scary or vice versa. But directors have missed the goal this time. ** out of *****
