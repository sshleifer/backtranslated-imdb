I first saw the series first show just to see and what a waste of time. The girl from Emmerdale was she fat, yes yes, she was supposed to be in a bold friend, but no one lost each way. <br /> <br /> As itv made a big mistake with this. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls are 100times better. I feel that the whole show was only about big people trying to lose weight, but never did they try to have love story oh, my god, what a waste of time and also the air. This show has not been repeated on ITV2 / 3/4 yes, it is as good as it is. <br /> <br /> I would say that not by the box just wastes money. <br /> <br /> CAUTION
