This movie was horrible. John Wayne is sometimes a brutal actor. The main role that played the role of "Maura" did a good job and tried his best to make scenes credible despite Wayne's inappropriate, one-dimensional, over-acting act. Did you seriously see him when he was going to sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such a horrible person in the second half of the film and then did nothing to pose for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without as much as an 'excuse'. The story was absolutely incredible. We would believe that two adult men, both great successes in their respected fields, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they did not like each other? You can almost randomly choose any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to get this movie made. It's all too bad because the only other Wayne movies I've seen are the shootist and rio bravo, both of whom were good movies. Unless you are paid, don't bother to see this.
