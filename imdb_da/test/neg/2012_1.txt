Oh dear gods, it's terrible. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before has my brain hurt as much as it did when I watched this movie. The action, if it is called, is enough to cause internal bleeding inside your head. The story is so thin it's just barely there ... no wait, scrap it. There is not a complete story there, but occasionally there are a few thin lines that protrude from all the degree of cheek and believe me the few lines should have been shot. The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from a distance. Some may call me sarcastic in this review, but I'm only trying to save some of you from a serious headache. But if you have to be what I like to call, a visual masochist (like myself), then take it straight out and look at this monstrosity.
