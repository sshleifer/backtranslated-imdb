I found the movie a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14. I was really annoyed with my little cousin when she was very hyper that day so I watched a movie on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it. <br /> <br /> She's 6, and she loved the movie, some she didn't get as the end, but I didn't understand you were Eddie's star of the video shoot I thought it was Jordan's video? but she enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I noticed the mistakes that at the end Jordan didn't actually play the guitar, but she never. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie if you're seriously bored or 10 and under. <br /> <br /> It comforted my cousin well. <br /> <br /> Even though everyone she was singing for the rest of the day then.
