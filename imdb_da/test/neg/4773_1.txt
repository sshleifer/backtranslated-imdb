I haven't seen such a stupid, stupid movie ever since. It has absolutely no logic, no horror - doesn't scare you, no excitement, no excitement. I don't think I found another part of the movie appealing .. <br /> I don't know what they were thinking when making the movie. You see the whole movie to find out that there is a plant that can walk around, draw human dead bodies and eat human flesh. Not only that, but it can also speak, ie. imitating sounds like a cell phone ringing or human speaking ... so it's like the plant makes the sound of a cell phone ringing so that they go after the cell phone and find out its a plant. .. how intelligent of the plant to set up an ambush. <br /> <br /> This is clearly the level of creativity at a primary school ... Bad !!!
