Let's put the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest ... it's not fun. I was appalled that the two main stars would agree to make a film that was so offensive and so damaging to race, and I am not referring to the obvious black and white commentary in the movie, but to the slam against other ethnic groups, such as Betty White's characterizations of the Hans Panic. Should we just criticize her and accept to make this movie a sign of senility ... is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical garbage? Or is it the author's fault? What about the third assistant makeup person ??? No, the error is with us to continue this kind of crap (in shadow of comedy) that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have a decency to say enough is enough ... racism is too real and it is not a laugh. We are all different, let's celebrate this diversity, don't poke fun at it and promote divisions.
