I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I watched this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story was very thin and the editing staff did their best to stretch it out as long as they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikely character that I found difficult to support him. Andy's working ability is good, but not good enough to make up for the bad writing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell did a great job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can't say anything bad about Andie, I always enjoy her acting. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so far fetched and incredible. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was almost as much of a disappointment as the movie itself. A nod from the pope and everything is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this movie to get something that happily ends and that the authors expect us to accept is pathetic. Gary does not change, and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation improve. <br /> <br /> There are lots of great movies to watch before this one. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
