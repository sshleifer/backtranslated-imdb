Bean, Kevin & Perry, British television creations who have made successful transitions on the BIG screen. Now Ali G's turn and I'm afraid to say this is not one of them! Ali has always been indecent, but fun with it. This movie was extremley sick and not fun at all. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment purposes. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is bad and deserves to make very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
