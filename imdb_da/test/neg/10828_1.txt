Right ... so you have a dam, tons of water (it seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that happens just below the dam's dam. Throw in a profitable glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and dissatisfied architect and his son, and then to spice things up, you add a faint plot and bad acting. All in all, when you look at this movie from a paying customer's point of view ... I would feel extremely knocked out if this was a pay-per-view movie. If you want a laugh ... then you really need to watch this movie.
