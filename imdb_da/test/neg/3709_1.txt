ZERO stars out of **** Endless Descent has absolutely no redeeming values, whether it's the ridiculously bad play, the ridiculously horrific special effects, the incompetent direction, the stupid script or the laced annoying musical score. It's the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this might even have the slightest consideration to turn green from a studio in the first place. I don't think I'm going to kill in the plot except to say it's about a bunch of people trapped underwater and killing many fake-looking creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me go into more detail on what is so terrible about this flick. First of all, the action is simply horrible. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a feat that is hard enough to achieve as it is. The supporting ideas are not really better. And what's with actor Luis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the chef, Francisco. He has a high tone and an accent that fits a comedy, not a sci-fi horror movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are even worse. The creatures range from strange eel to giant starfish and mostquitoes. The effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie, and I don't think I should kill any further in this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has a little cult status because of all the horrible movies he's made. I'm sure some will enjoy Endless Descent in an Ed Wood type way, but I don't even think it's so good. All he does is sloppy, especially the camera. The man can't lead a movie, that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> This was the last of four films that took place underwater, and it certainly makes Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad movies in their own right) begin to look masterful in comparison. Either way, just stick with The Abyss.
