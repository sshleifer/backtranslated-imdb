Can this "movie" be considered a movie? Imagine the situation: Someone puts a handy cam over a tripod and in front of a boardwalk and movie people walking or jogging along it. Then he places the camera on a beach, buys some ducks in a pet store, opens their cage and lets them run in front of the camera. Later he just films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in an absolute darkness. Is it an experiment or just an insult to the public's intelligence? What would happen if any unknown instructor made such a movie? Would we mark his job by 10? I always disappoint managers who think they can do everything they want when they become famous.
