***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible. This woman deceives her employers right from the start and continues so independently to tear them apart. At the end you see her making a profession out of the trade she had learned from her "student" father. I put student in quotes because the governor never seems to teach the child anything. She seems to hate her and can't stand close to her. I felt sorry for the little girl who would simply be loved, absent, that it was understandable that she would say and violate things just to get attention, but the viewer should not sympathize with the little girl, considered the viewer to sympathize with the governor who hated her student and manipulated and deceived his employers. I just couldn't do it. It was not the story of a self-made woman, but it was a window into the mind of someone who uses others at every opportunity without any other thought for someone outside their own family. I couldn't stand the governor! This was a really horrible movie. I only paid a dollar to rent it, but even that was too much!
