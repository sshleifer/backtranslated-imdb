I won't say the show is all bad because there are some fun parts, like Spencer, and some random events. But apart from that, let's see, it's just another dry sitcom that kids buy into. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was sweet and fun like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she is mediocre in ICarly and is just not as fun as she is trying to be. The actor who plays Sam seems to be half asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clumsy that I would think of them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is okay, but not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the situations are unrealistic, but not everything is bad. Some are bothersome. Here are a few: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14 years old and have a web show giving away too much personal information with a weekly audience of 27,000 (WTF) with little or no advertising, and they can still continue their lives not being attacked by crazy people <2. The web show gets too much praise ($ 100,000 a year to announce sneakers, a free trip to Japan, Plain White Ts performance, etc.). In fact, anyone over the age of 6 will not find their "comedy" entertaining. <br /> <br /> 3. How are they so "average" but they own a three story loft, Spencer hardly does anything and can still afford many basic luxuries and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. All the adults are idiots. All of them. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5-foot tall girl, no matter how uncomfortable and persistent, can take down trained police unless she is muscular. Sam is thin and small. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can fall down 9 stories in a lift and live. <br /> <br /> 7. The children can find out about criminals better than the police. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. Really, it seems to be harmless, but make the kids think they can be disgusting to their elders, living alone in Seattle when they are only 14 with an irresponsible moron, and giving personal information is just wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. What happened to the comics when I was her age?
