I only bought this DVD because it was dirty and it seemed interesting in its own special way ("special" means "retarded"). The movie turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really runs the story, and of course the play is terrible. It wasn't even "bad" in a campy way - it was just pretty bad. There is actually a handful of lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is awkward and weak. All I could think of while I was looking at this was that this could really be a good movie if the script got a bigger review (if it was written by someone who actually understood the drug culture) and if some decent actors were thrown . I would not recommend "Weekend with the Babysitter" unless you are planning a career in movies and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
