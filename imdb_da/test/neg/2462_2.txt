"JB" (Jack Black) runs away from home after being spanked by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally joins Hollywood and crosses the biggest guitarist he has ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). After a small villain, they choose two joints and perform an open mic night on what seems to be a less than popular bar. For their shock, they don't do it well. <br /> <br /> Back on their less-than-spectacular occasion, the two are trying to figure out what the legend of rock has that they don't do while looking at some old magazines. It is only when they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar selection. <br /> <br /> While trying to look for a similar choice, an employee of the music store (Ben Stiller, who is also the movie's Executive Producer) tells him the old story of "Pick of Destiny" as they seek. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the election, which was made by Satan's tooth, is in the history of the rock museum. <br /> <br /> Now, the two pot smokers with delusions go on a music-filled adventure to steal the pick. <br /> <br /> Let me say this in front if you're not a fan of Tenacious D who gave us comedy actor Jack Black so you should skip this one. I'm not a fan of these two and only looked at it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> The wit mostly produces more silence than anything else. Maybe I laughed at three of the jokes and chuckled on a few others. Tenacious D is only for a particular audience that I am not. <br /> <br /> This movie is loaded in many places and here are the worst jokes shown. And let me say that when Black and Glass do not work, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are by and done by Tenacious D. Many of the songs perfectly promote the story by describing their adventures at the time of the movie. However, I felt that the songs sounded similar to being explained. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that the language will turn off many people. There are many words in four letters in this movie. There are also some drug references. I would not recommend this to children. Part of Tenacious's schtick is that black is in your face and the glass remains in his shadows for the most part. That's how they are in this movie, and it doesn't really work. Now this may have been part of the action, but I felt that Glass just didn't want to be there. In one scene, he performs his (background) texts at a party, and he just can't work alone. Tenacious D is apparently rock fans in real life and may have two rock legends in the movie, I lost count because I was so sad this movie. Personally, I would have liked to see several rock legends and icons in the movie. However, we do not get it. <br /> <br /> What we get is a movie full of lame jokes, lots of scary language, a noisy script. You also get horrible plays and an unoriginal story. But you get some really good songs that are pretty much the same. The story could have been promising, but many of the scenes seemed to have been added to the movie last minute. This is similar to The Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much larger sequel - and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D has only a small subsequent, with a few HBO specialties under their belt. And unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> If you're a hard core fan of Tenacious D, then I suggest you check it out. But like most of the movie's audience when this movie was released to theaters, I'd say avoid this. Save your money on this, guys.
