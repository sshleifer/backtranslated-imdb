I can't really remember any details about this movie, except that the setting is so familiar. Then I realized it was filmed at Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. It was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and walked around the country. The guy who owns / manages the hostel has managed to get into the movie. All I can remember about the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It's great to look just for the landscape (I mean rock formations) ... If you're just looking for soft-core porn, you'll probably be better served elsewhere. I don't even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
