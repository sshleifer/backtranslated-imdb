Never have I seen a movie so horrible that I have gone crazy. It was a great waste of time to watch this crappy movie. There are many things I hate about this movie: The songs are so horrible (even a little catchy) I hit my head on the wall (especially from the song 'Grandpa must sue the pants out of Santa', which I hit 10 times * Shrugs *), drawn design, and the evil, greedy and bitchy cousin Mel. <br /> <br /> I can't stand her for a second, she has to be one of the most bitchiest people I've ever seen. Even though I make a friend of her southern voice. <br /> <br /> The only bright side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake from Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend people to watch for the holiday as it was a big disgrace to the x-mas.
