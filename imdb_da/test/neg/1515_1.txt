Yes, it must be one of the noisiest movies I've ever seen. It's completely tasteless, has no style, the story is so thin you can watch television through it, and the whole movie has so many holes you could run through an oil tanker. <br /> <br /> Sure, you appreciate a good B movie as much as most white homo sapiens do. But it must be the worst I have seen. In fact, it is B that it lacks everything that makes a B movie interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is based on such charming objects that characters crap out of each other, different body functions and complete lack of reason on anything on the screen. It's not even fun. In fact, it is quite the opposite. I found it even boring at times because of it's extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I find nothing good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time to see it, and I hope others do not make the same mistake. If you also pay for it, you must have a serious brain canus done.
