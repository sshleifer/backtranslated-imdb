I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid, and that scared the ever-living crap out of me. When I found it, I saw it. I wish I didn't. The movie was not scary. The plot is about an old woman who runs the castle. She feeds this awful fragile person in the basement of a 12th century castle. She continually beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day she dies. So a few months later a family moves in. A father, a mother and their blind daughter. The father was involved in a terrible car accident that killed their son and left their daughter-in-law. <br /> <br /> Later through the movie the daughter hears sounds, things break, etc., and everyone is not worried about anything at all. It is until a few people die. Apparently the creature in the basement is broken free and kills people. How this thing survived the last few months without food or water is impossible! Every time I saw the creature, it gave me the cribs. The creature goes on a gory kill spree and the police blame the danger of the deaths. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars out of 10. Creepy not scary!
