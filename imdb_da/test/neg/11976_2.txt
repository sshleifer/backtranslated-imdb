Full view of the entire movie adaptation of a video game, this is another horrible movie by Mr. Boll. How he continues to be hired to make films is a constant surprise to me and of course most of the film community. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I would say that this experiment was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialogues were even half decent in Far Cry, although he still misuses some sentences, and in some cases he doesn't even use the sentences correctly. <br /> <br /> Apart from Jack Carver being American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role. One exception is the ridiculously lame lines he uses to get to bed with the girl. And we must believe that she is ready to have sex with him so relaxed after such a minimal dialogue? Emile? Just there for comic relief I am sure and still paralyzed. Jack's character looks old and tired, but is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the changing super soldiers in the lab. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this for the Far Cry fitting. But you can just waste an hour and a half and see it if you have nothing better to do.
