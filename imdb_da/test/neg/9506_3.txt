I'm partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partially" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the later category. <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from the same basic problems as Miyazaki's latest movie "Howl's Moving Castle". An exciting premise has been created, but then it is immediately reduced to a little more than a background for some unimaginable events that only serve to confuse the plot instead of explaining it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post-Pokalyptic world story is set and actually looks like a very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on, things go down the hill. The middle part of the film consists mainly of thinly blurred eco-propaganda, and the end is greatly confused by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism that destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie feels like someone ripped out every other page from the script before they transferred it to the animators. What is left is something that is visually stunning (although the version I saw was once a copy of the Nth generation with poor color - giving rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her naked bottom when flying) But that doesn't make sense and eventually left me confused.
