This movie is perfect for any aspiring screenwriter, actor or director. By watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today. There are so many clichés that it caused me to sit through this movie. Nothing about it is original, and every single line spoken has been ripped from the cliché movies that we all saw in the 90s. Although it has a few cheap laughs, it is generally wrong that it is wrong. I was so incredibly sorry and the movie was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup was dressed on Tara Reid's face to hide the massive bags and wrinkles from her endless party. Seriously she had so much foundation, you could literally scrape it off and refill a whole bottle. <br /> <br /> What shocked me was that so many of the talented and popular casts would write for this piece of junk. And I don't know how I sat through the terrible scream that Ashton Kutcher does, do you know when he's like angry or something, and he shouts his words in this annoying way? Ashton's horrible "talks", Tar's face are ten shades darker than her neck, an uneven owl, a script that seemed like a three-year work ... <br /> <br /> Seriously in my whole life there has been no one movie that I have seen that I could not at any time enjoy how much it was. This deserves a price to be the first. BATHING BATH BATH ... I don't think there is a single word in the English dictionary that might describe this blurry movie. Today I tried to see it again, but I had to turn it off as ten minutes in because I was crying from the overwhelming number of clichés. <br /> <br /> Do not even disturb renting this on your blockbuster, it is not worth the cent, in fact I am willing to pay someone out there considering watching this movie so they can go do something decent with their life .
