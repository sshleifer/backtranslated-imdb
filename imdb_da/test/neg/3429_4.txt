This second world war film, set in Borneo, is trying so hard to work on so many levels, it's a shame it fails at all. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is a fugitive American who testifies of executions of his companions of Japanese. He walks deep into Borneo's jungle, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds Nolte's adopted tribe. Nolte, who now looks like Robert Plant, has become his tribe new king. He defeated a strong warrior in a bloody battle and had a narrative tattoo on his chest (a dragon). Now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, Nolteland is not doing well. Havers wants the trunk to help fight Japanese who invade the island. He teaches the natives how to use machine guns, and a whole lot starts shooting. As the trunk becomes more successful, they run up against a new squadron of Japanese, which is not like the others. This group cannibalizes the villages they conquer to keep their strength up (talk about your sushi) and they move through the jungles even faster than the trunk. As we know the war result, we finally know the tribe tribe, but with great losses. Here comes the spoilers: Havers are injured and returned to "civilization". He gives the kingdom the location, and Nolte is trapped. Havers then goes through the trouble of releasing Nolte, and the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> Milius's direction is certainly appropriate, but the manuscript here is rather vague in its motives. It presents story ideas, then surrenders them to come to the next story idea. Nolte is horrible when the soldier became king, desperately trying to channel Marlon Brando's colonel Kurtz's spirit. He speaks of the freedom and beauty of the jungle and the wealth of his people, and you will not believe in a second the words he derives. He is often inadvertently fun, especially his first bug out in the jungle, and he uses the rest of the movie to sound like a hippie. Nigel Havers uses the film to watch Nolte as if he were Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship, not entirely to sex, and goes into an unspoken relationship that must have had native speakers. Havers are often around and have an internal conflict, rejected on the tribal headhunting, but bask in Nolte's attention. His colleagues quickly hit British soldiers faster than the Bounty landing party in Tahiti, but all I saw about Borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green. The climatic betrayal where Havers gives away Nolte's location is completely without reason. There is no idea why Havers does this except to keep the movie going. I was angry when at random Havers and Nolte ended up on the same ship that goes to the Philippines, the ship is going to run due, and Havers runs to the team to release the newly scaled Nolte. No goodbye kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king and explains the title. <br /> <br /> If you fought for a war and an enemy squadron ate your allies, wouldn't it fear you? This elite Japanese group is not shown enough, even though their eating habits are so terrible that I would become a conscientious objection immediately. The same type of ghost birds were handled much better in "The 13th Warrior." Other types of interesting ideas have been dropped. What about the fact that so modern technology causes deaths for so many returning people? Why did King Nolte let the British use their subjects without too much hesitation? Why can't Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? In the end, "Goodbye to the King" is a downturn, not anchored by a strong leader, and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring his possibilities. I can't recommend this one. <br /> <br /> This movie is classified (PG13) for strong physical violence, strong weapon violence, some gore, some profanities, some sexual references and adult situations.
