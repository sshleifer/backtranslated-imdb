Looking for a movie for your Turkish film festival? ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst movies of all time. The reason, the story of a post-apocalyptic roller skating Samurai Warrior, is a marvelous hodge-podge movie of everything from STAR WARS to SEVEN SAMAURI. The play turns from bland to abysmal. The scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to give laughter. Frank Stalone's Black Knight is reminiscent of John Cleese's Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON AND HOLY GRAIL. (Word of advice, Frank: When you bend to make a movie like this, your career is over.) I chanced on this little stink bomb on a low-cable channel and I couldn't stop watching. It's like seeing a train wreck, you just can't look away.
