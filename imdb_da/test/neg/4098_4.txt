Although I enjoy Steve Carrell's work, Evan Almighty thought that so many other overdone films turned out to be much worse than I hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be a cheesy family movie, the kind that uses the famous comedian to enhance their image but ultimately fails to deliver. <br /> <br /> The usual Carell's dorky humor is almost absent from the movie, and even though he made me grab a couple of times, there was nothing funny about him in Almighty Evan. <br /> <br /> His 3 children, though probably somehow important to a biblical character, were really useless in the movie and the terrible actors. Even his wife was a third leg for such a simple story. <br /> <br /> Spending so much money on making a comedy was a big mistake. Although Carell's career could benefit from this movie, there is no real reason to see it. <br /> <br /> If only a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe some other SNL cast, it could actually have been much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for a couple of chuckles here and there.
