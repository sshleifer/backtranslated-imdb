I'm very upset by some posts I read on the bulletin boards for this movie, people say it's actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best to date, it does not make a good movie, no way in hell! Far Cry is a clichéd show full of bad acting, poor direction and an uninspired story with a foam script. This is Boll's first clean action movie, and the news flashes, action movies aren't too hard to do because a basic action is all you need are explosions and gunfights scattered around a flimsy plot, and hi, Mr. Ball succeeds doing it. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, are all horror games adapted to Boll's movies, much worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things that make it his best yet: two great leads and a few well-known action sequences. To Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female manager. The usually large Udo Kier is acceptable, as the clichéd villain and the supportive caste are quite bad. Towards the end of the movie there is a surprisingly exciting hunting sequence that came as a shock when Boll was behind the camera. Unfortunately, the rest of the film has an incredibly cheap feeling of it with poor CGI, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst is going to a sex scene, I think I ever have the scene. Not only did the two only know each other for six hours, but all it takes is that he says he kept warm while he was in the army cutting his soldiers. He already got her to take off his clothes just by telling her. Then he left and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize, it's a bad movie. It's fun action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're totally sad. One can probably do worse than pop this in and see it, but I say personally to watch a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derived root. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
