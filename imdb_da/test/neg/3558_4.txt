A nicely developed 1930s setting gives great interest to a viewer at the beginning of the 21st century; Unfortunately, "London belongs to me" has little else to recommend besides lashings of quaint English charm. All the problems are based on the deeply unfocused story. The main drawing is about the actions of young boys Richard Attenborough, the problems he gets into, and how the community where he lives together to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main problem here is that Attenborough's character brings everything to himself and is honestly guilty of almost any accusation against him, so it's confusing why the movie (and all the characters) has so much sympathy for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances when he really is not; And besides, he's not shown too much to have remorse for his actions, but only cares about getting away with things he didn't intend to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that definitely has nothing to do with the main line, and you wonder what he is doing there (although Sim is as always super). You know there is a problem with the structure when the main plot is constantly affecting the subplot, but not the other way around. And after a quiet pace and careful build-up, the plot falls completely apart over the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that doesn't even show us whether Attenborough's character has evolved from the previous case at all. The movie doesn't end, it just stops. <br /> <br /> The film, the direction and the general feeling of the movie can all be praised, but unfortunately the story and structure of the pieces is constant. A final point in trivia: Alec Guinness based his performance on the very superior movie "The Ladykillers" on Alastair Sim's performance in this movie, right down to both characters, which almost have identical first scenes.
