Everyone in the PC culture is appalled at the dogmatic Christian perception of this film and claims it contains racist idea and / or religious intolerance. Those who don't care about this but are oriented towards slender production values ​​and competent actions are appalled at the lack of such here. <br /> <br /> Those who decry both of these are of the opinion that this production was detached from the public, as shown in the comments here. <br /> <br /> What is an interesting premise that is not original but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is treated in a rather immature way in this movie, yet done with gusto. What the crew and the actors lacked in sensitivity, professional skills and technical expertise is somewhat balanced by the intensity they show. It's almost as bad as many believe here, and it would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is probably mediocrity to induce laughter and groans. However, it unfolds with sufficient intensity to keep interest throughout, and is close to a Corman-produced entrance in its earliest working hours, or the material Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for $ 2 (or less) as I did, you will not feel disappointed, but will wish you could have had a post on how it was made.
