... what a porn movie would look like if you looked sexy and just left in the bad dialogue, cheap set and bad acting, you would have the Galaxy. <br /> <br /> This movie came out as the original Star Wars turned out to be a science fiction market. This in turn leads to some gemstones like Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and of course this was one of them. (Of course I say because I didn't even hear about this movie until some days ago. I missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here's the underlying problem. Dorothy Stratton couldn't act, so most of the movie didn't even try. I understand that her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me I cannot understand why. The movie clearly tried to Spoof Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but they clearly do not understand than when you spoof something, it must be fun! This movie was not, or at least the comic timing of jokes that could have been fun, wasn't it. Science Fiction is ripe for parody, as Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest appeared. However, this movie made it bad.
