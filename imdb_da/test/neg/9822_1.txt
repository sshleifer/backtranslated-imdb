Where do we start with an offer like this? I almost said movies, but it would go a step too far. The only thing hellish about this movie is that it is definitely a marriage made in hell between nothing and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning not to harm your spirit to the point where one can think that all good filmmakers have left the planet and their resources have been handed over to dunderheads who have made this classic piece of trashy waste just as it is sister in poor "League of Extraordinary Twaddle". They are neither science fiction nor facts, entertaining or thought-provoking, humorous or weighty, but are in a twilight area without any and all accoutrements that entice people to abandon their valuable time, sit in a darkened space and generally be more enlightened, revitalized or happy at the end of it. If we could award "Turkey" points to movies like this, it would be a beak as we would go through turkey, ham, potatoes, sprouts, gravy and all other decorations before we reached the bottom.
