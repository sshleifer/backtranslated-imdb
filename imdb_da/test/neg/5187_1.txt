I think if you like snowboarding, you can enjoy a bit of watching some beautiful scenes and some good tricks. But that's the whole movie has to offer. The story is non-existent, and any jokes that may have been in the movie were not fun, even at a sympathy level. I also didn't like the characters, and the main gift (Adam Grimes) tried his best, and for a comedy like this one doesn't have to be much, but when he was surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope of making this movie good. but I shouldn't be too hard on them because all I know could have great skill, but with a script I could have written in ten minutes, they had the skills they had, and hid themselves from fear of show up in this movie. my advice is not to see what i wish i never did!
