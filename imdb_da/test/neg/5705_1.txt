If this is not strongly highlighted on each list of "what not to see", it should only be because those who keep that list are not aware of its existence, as long as it is still the acceptable alternative . I'm not kidding you, it's a * bad * "movie". Joseph Meeker returns from the dead, with various vague, indefinite supernatural powers whose most employed appear to be in new, increasingly comical appearance and ridiculous (and never frightening or scary ... generally, when this latter goes for them, it wins, is just bizarre, and attempts at the former just do not work, period) outfits and stereotypes / archetypes, and he is portrayed by David Keith (who I respect in ... well at least Daredevil), do one more often not even terribly inconsistent (which could also have script) and often over top performance. A character or two have personalities so incredibly annoying that they are painful to see. The editing thinks it is considerably more wise than it really is (and what on Earth was with the red hue of flashbacks?). Cinematography ... Oh, dear. Framing, covering, effective use of angle (which could also be attributed to editing too), please, boys, stop me when I say something you've ever heard of the existence of. As for the technical side, it is a rather miserable excuse for something more worth putting into the projector than unexposed film. But why stop there? The reason is just bad. The basic idea has been made and it has been done so much better than this (The Crow would be one). The way you know is gimmicky, and while there is some explanation behind flashbacks, it's still not satisfactory. Pacing is about non-existent. The management is clearly unlikeable, and there is more personality in a drawer door, not to mention that they are also considerably less wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What do you do in everything that is good and just (the pun)? Perine, you were already fun before this at The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, I haven't seen you before the American Pie, but if you were nothing else, you were fun later, and in these productions entertainment was intentional. Dialogue is ... the less said, the better. The language is unrestrained and tends to be silly. The violence is scary and they do not even seem to be trying to hide it (it could have been the smarter strategy). Sign, don't let me get started. Why spend so much energy highlighting unexciting, sometimes completely illogical, events? The more you think about it, the worse it gets. It is not even passable as a "bad horror flick" or a B-movie (it may well pass through the rest of the alphabet and continue yet), it could not scare you at the shameful day of your life if it had an electrified scraper. I only recommend this to people who want to disprove how bad this is and don't say I don't warn you. 1.10
