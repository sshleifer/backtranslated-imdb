Unlike most reviewers here, I hated this movie simply because the author / director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many movie fans correspond to "EXTREME self-indulgence" to "movie GENIUS!", But I don't buy into the cult of personality. A movie should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen movie, of course). * SPOILER * (as well, save your time ...) There's nothing brilliant about showing you the foot-long porn star you know in the last frame - it's actually a sticky maneuver like SCREAM's movie school hackism. <br /> <br /> The poseur flick has achieved 'great movie' status based on his indulgence and pandering to the audience ?? who are primarily the author / director. But the rest of the audience should look down on porno-sour, brutal character. Flicket had a different angle to the porn industry and looked down at every player it could bash. No matter, just love your writer / instructor. Love these four-minute steadicam segments that were supposed to show the energy at the moment, but somehow had all the enlistments of an off-switch. Love the story - no matter how boring it is. While the topic has the potential to be fascinating ?? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your worshiping writer / instructor somehow managed to make it look again, DULL. Partly because of its maturity. Here's something your author's heroes didn't try: Gives the character's dimension. Or soul. All in all, to give a promise, except Genius That Paul is of course. But I do not buy. I don't buy indulgent hacks with amazing hype. <br /> <br /> Another elongated auteurist hack piece, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will probably see this indulgent flick again. Not my problem.
