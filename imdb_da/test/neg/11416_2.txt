"Quit while you are already" is a phrase they never learn. Typical Hollywood sequel scenario: If the first movie was only shocking, the other one wasn't, expecting the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year. Even worse are the prequalels whose events were already explained in detail. If you haven't seen the first two movies, you won't like this one. It's like starting to see the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars with the last trilogy movie. So "stand alone" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember in the first film about Lucia's revenge? Remember the second about the long lost, savage brother? Well, if you saw the two 5 min moments and paste them together, would you get ?? and 5 min prequel. But the creators ether thought that these 5 mins were important historical events or would just give a job to some actors, cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process. "I have a lot of money, I make movies alive, and I'm bored. What should I do?" I know I'm making a movie. "So anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it in 90 min it is this movie. And you know what will happen to the most important" immortal "characters, so there is some excitement. The only thing that made my eyebrows rise was mum who killed in the beggar about the movie. Sick. The rest was Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, see Braveheart only then this movie. > <br /> Now I have to run a little bit ?? The movie put me in the mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire vs werewolf" in the first place? It is older than I am and grew old just as quickly. Girls in heat, while werewolves look like a psycho-bearer Hiding bad movies behind splitting fails. Isn't it time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright position? How can their unchanging werewolves even bred if they rip everyone into strips? And why did the vampires not rule the world with all their powers? a, blue ?? What a waste.
