Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects is truly amazing. The hostesses do a good job. I especially enjoy seeing the "project" come together. The end result is much better than when they came from the assembly line what about the mechanical and cosmetic progress today. But I get annoyed by the fact that the "projects" seem to belong to the already rich and / or famous. It's too bad that they are being reviewed, can afford the company. Let's see now, Vince Neill from Motley Crew gets a car to do to his friend. Hi! If he (Neill) was a true friend, he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What a joke! Another episode shows a middle-aged seemingly charitable gal who gets his '56 caddy named Betsy done. 30+ year man was behind it all. The couple looked like money was not in short supply. What a shame. I think the guys on the lunch box like I will have to save for the day that never comes. I happen to own a '53 Ford project Chip. Will anyone choose me?
