Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really really hate. It is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract information from captured intelligence agents. I have had some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he goes all over the top of this movie. He does not go so much over the line, he bumps over it, and then he jumps again and again. He stiffens and mugs as if on an incredibly poor acid trip. It is one of the rare performances where you want you to get into the movie and hit the man within an inch of his life to do something really awful. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or another prize for bad acting? That is the only conclusion I can make. Thanks Dennis, you gave us a bad performance in the past. Where was the instructor to rule in this guy? The opposite end of the extremes is Winona Ryder, she's a plastic and plastic company. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. It was, of course, an insult to wax dummies all over the world, all of which could have more humanity in the role of Jerry's minor cousin / wife. This brings up the mixed message of the film that it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and get a child from the association. I fail to see what is so "okay" about it, but it looks as though Hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. Talk about "family values." <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a forward-looking tale of Lewis's life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the really weird scene where Jerry runs up to school, begins to bend a tune, and everyone begins to dance as if it was Broadway musical in search of Tony. Imagination and reality are thrown together in a mixture that does not work. But who really cares? I dont do that. And neither should you. You can't get back to the minutes of life you would waste on this movie. So don't waste your time, it is too valuable for something, this misunderstood and poor.
