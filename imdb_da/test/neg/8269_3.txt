The TV advertiser, who introduced this late on a Saturday night, said it should have won the Oscars. Quite a statement about a movie I had never heard of ... even though I should have taken notice of a TV announcer, I don't know. In case the spokesman talked talked. <br /> <br /> It's a dull, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I couldn't get on with Hoskins' awful Burr-ming rubber accent. Can't see any benefit from being put in the Midlands anyway. <br /> <br /> Undissolved threads abound ... and I wouldn't normally have it here, but half of them don't make sense. And what about when Hoskins says he'll choose Felicia from outside her B&B, even though she never told him exactly where she lived? Or she buys into the funeral, which clearly never took place (and where was she these days ???) Clumbsy and poorly thought through business if you ask me. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller without excitement. It is full of pretentious shops. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> Didn't like it. Thought it was nonsense. Would not recommend it. "Nuff said.
