I know it sounds crazy, but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated part 3 and then comes part 4. I was like you fool me with this? Kid 'n Play does not exist in this movie and it would have been okay if they were not foolishly entitled to the movie House Party 4 as if it were in any way, form, form or fashion related to its predecessors. Every time this movie comes late at night on the US, I shoot my TV with a rifle. Frankly, it's really just the terrible thing. * throws * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining fan of Kid 'n Play who will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), I was horrified. Remember the stupid little boy group of impure? They sneak into House Party 3. Okay, fine and good, but how can Part 4 be just about them and nothing else, and it also seems that they are not even the same children from Part 3. * confused! !!! * House Party fans: Do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. Besides that, everything else is ridiculous.
