Where do I start? The film, about a love between two high school students during wartime while being a living weapon, and their struggle to sustain that love is a very good piece. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi, which was also transformed into an anime in 2002, of which I have not yet read or seen. This review is about this adaptation of living action. Unfortunately, this honest to goodness was a horrible movie. It is not as if you could place certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is guilty or is acting blamefully. Unfortunately, it is a series of underlying and ineffective elements that bring down this movie. <br /> <br /> The action is bad. Not to say Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn't have much to work with and seemed to be overlooked. Nor did it seem to have the physical area to draw the viewer in history and be too old for their parts in a distracting way. Scripture was weak, leaders seem unrealistic and behave irrationally. The movie also plays for the heartbeats, but ends up being predictable while not convincing and underdeveloping the characters. There are also pacing problems. <br /> <br /> Visually, it is unremarkable. The movie uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. The other special effects also have a cheap look at them, especially where minimalist practical special effects could have been used. There is also no visual flair, as if there was no film designer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were fine but unremarkable. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not devoid of enjoyment, and fans of the series should not be discouraged to see it at least once just to be clarified. People who are not familiar with Saikano are probably not the place to jump in, as it is not a very good movie or melodrama. It's not the movie or cast and the crew's fault, it's just not inspired, and that's what kills it.
