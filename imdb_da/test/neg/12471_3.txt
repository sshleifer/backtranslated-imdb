"Tart" is a good illustration of the old, Yogi Berra, who says, "If you don't know where you are going, you will end up with another place." Writer / Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $ 3 million movie that ends with another place. "Tart" is either an upcoming age story with no character that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without humor or a sexploitation movie without something that is particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> Unlike the standard Swain film, "Tart" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to give two very nice shots: Swain and Barton's scene take a whirlpool and Swain's scene in the park - with a beautiful montage of the sculpture "Alice in Wonderland". The symbolism incorporated in these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unit of tone) actually has some visionary talent and hope to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is even possible that Waye tried a fusion of the somewhat expressionist "Metropolitan" and the camp's classic "Terrible Intentions", which also deals with the Manhattan upper class. There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes. The former technique indicated the symbolism and the latter by intentional distance from the characters and their motivations. "Tart" seemed to turn into the camp area at least twice, and it would have been advisable to continue in that direction. First, there was the scene where they tried to dump the apparently deceased Swain into the trash. Then there is much about her father being Jewish (played to the same extreme as Joel Gray dances with the Jewish guerilla in "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In her other films, Swain's acting technique is overwhelming every scene where she looks (insert scenes chewing here), but in "Tart" she actually shows an ability to hold back. This is the best performance of her career. It also gives some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in "Girl" to hulking lumped in "Pumpkin". This transformation was about half the time she made "Tart"; so go the ravages of time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense's" I Feel Better Girl) and Lacey Chabet are great at supporting roles. The rest of the casting is simply awful, although some of the blame for this should go to Waye's script and direction.
