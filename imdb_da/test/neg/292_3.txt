Recap: Simon leads a small team of specialist agents who specialize in finding and returning missing people against all possible odds. Their latest mission is about the grandchild of a friend of theirs. She seems to have been trapped on the web by a particularly brutal criminal, and anyone who has searched for her has missed out. But now the librarians are on the case. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is pure B action, through and through. The key phrase for this is unlimited supply. There is unlimited supply of ammunition, they do not need to be reloaded once. There is an unlimited supply of evil guys, so the heroes have something to shoot at. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them carried, in vain (and as always failed) attempts to distract from the plot holes. And there is an unlimited supply of bad plays (it's almost like Erika Eleniak's performance shines in this, what about it?), And actors who don't seem to fit more than the payslip (and why should they, when no one else seems? ). <br /> <br /> And, as in most B-Action movies, there is an unlimited supply of bad weaponry. But these seem to be almost ridiculously bad. I think I saw more realistic weapons ships when I played cowboy as a child. <br /> <br /> But again I didn't expect much either, how could I get from an action movie called the librarians? And it actually lives over what could be expected. 90 minutes more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. But I am unsure whether I can call it entertaining, it didn't keep me very interesting. <br /> <br /> 3/10
