I waited to bid Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to action after the gloomy films he had made after "Eraser". "End of Days" can, however, be added to the bleak films he has had the misfortune to get into. "End of Days" starts well with a gripping action sequence, but quickly becomes a drilling, focuses on action and excitement and concentrates on instead of the study of demonic events and the fast-paced millennium (read "Doomsday"). <br /> <br /> Performances are outdated, special effects so-so and abundant. Considering myself a drowsy Schwarzenegger fan, I couldn't believe I didn't like this movie, but with such a horrible lamb script, what could Arnie have done besides moving on with this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
