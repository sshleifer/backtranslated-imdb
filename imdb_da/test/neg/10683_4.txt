I was ready to hate this, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - even though the MTV style of film making (shot at DV, to start) is pretty eye-catching! I liked the script's self-sucking style, as well as the central idea of ​​getting the female vampire leading double as a contract killer. As for the cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the "star" of these horrible "redemptions" intro) has an undeniable display presence - and is quite sensual despite his age; But Christopher Adam's hammy top villain is uncomfortable. David Warbeck has a short role as a doctor (called "The Horror-Movie Man"!), Who leads the autopsy on one of the vampire victims; The movie seems to have taken quite a while to shoot when Warbeck died in 1997! There is plenty of nudity and violence at hand, but not very sensuous (especially since its subplot involves a secret society of vampires infiltrating the power structures that are hardly developed); the film is also slow for its purpose, and eventually slides into the tedium in the last half hour.
