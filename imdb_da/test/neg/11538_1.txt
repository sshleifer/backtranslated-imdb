This movie can't decide what it is - a soft porn or a sf movie. Not enough plot for a real movie, but too much for a porn. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far far away, a good princess (we know she is good because she has long blond hair, wears a white toga, is polite and hangs wistfully about her dying mother when we first see her) inherit the kingdom over her eldest sister who is evil (and we know because she has dark hair and has too much makeup, abuses her male sexual slaves, snails and curls her lips constantly and speaks violently about the horrors, she will commit when she is queen. The evil princess is disturbed and tries to take a coup, but the good sister gets away to Earth. Of course she materializes buck naked in a bar during a wet T-shirt competition. It really goes downhill from there. The action is ridiculous, the dialogue sounds like it was written for a porn, and the general story is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make happy the kind of person who sees this on the skin. I love "good" bad movies and this is not even fun at a "bad movie" level.
