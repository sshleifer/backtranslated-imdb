This movie is up there with The Oscar and Moment by Moment as one of the unintentional funny movies all the time. <br /> <br /> It is worth renting for a somewhat great laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is completely ridiculous. Nothing in life would happen like this. It's so incredible. the way James Woods tries and needs heavy heaters than they give this supposed two-bit hustler a job 3000 miles away in LA, what a joke <br /> <br /> I love the old beat VW bug to denote how low they 'Sean Young is so incredibly bad as "I will love you forever, no matter what wife" you will ever see. if you are in life because of all 'tootskis'. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is so incredibly bad as it wasn't so much fun, you would vomit on how sweetly sweet Young is trying to project herself. And as bad as you will ever see. <br /> <br /> James Wood takes over the whole movie and he is so much fun and is way over the top, just not to be believed, Woods seems like a parody of a cocaine enemy off Saturday Night Live. But seeing Woods on `ludes' is worth the price of the rental. <br /> <br /> I love it when Woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more guts that he doesn't do the thing before, Woods did just three huge lines of cola. <br /> These are some very fun things. <br /> <br /> The ending is so comical but just on par with the rest of the movie.
