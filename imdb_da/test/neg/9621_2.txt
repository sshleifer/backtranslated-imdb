"MirrorMask" was a terribly disappointing movie for me. I had expected a lot from a Jim Henson production and had found good reviews comparing it to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice In Wonderland". Unfortunately, the film ended in one of the "style over fabric" pile of movies. While most children dream of running away from home to participate in a circus, Helena is a child who has grown up in a circus (child labor, someone?) Who wants to run away to join Real Life. Helena wants her mother to fall dead, which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a children's fantasy film. Next thing you know, Helena's mother flops over, and for some reason she's suddenly transported to another world. Meanwhile, I felt like I was being transported to the Museum of Contemporary Art with a pair of foggy sepia-tinted glasses. <br /> <br /> The showcase of CGI-generated creatures and backgrounds was interesting first and I liked the Orbiting Giants. It was a bit tedious after a couple of minutes, and I felt sensational ... <br /> <br /> With no sense of narrative and MTV style clips and soundtrack (the sphinx reminded me of basement Jaxx 'Where's the head "), I did not feel involved in the main character's situation and also frustrated when we waited for the film to lead us anywhere it would, hopefully towards the theater's exit sign ...
