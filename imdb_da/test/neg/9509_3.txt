Clearly, the only reason I saw this movie - since it's been about a decade since it was released - was because of Ian Holm; I was thrilled to see his portrayal of my other favorite character in this game. In any case, this movie is as laughing as something that Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth." But some of the best parts of the game have been omitted. I understand the management / editing choices, but I don't think it really does justice to the game. Maybe I'm too much a purist. I would have to lead people (who have read this far) towards Branagh's version, if it were not that I despise his tendency to over-dramatize. Still, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then we are not all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now all he has done is to prove that he wants to make extinct language films. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only Shakespeare-worthy play here is Scofield as The Ghost.
