The cannon is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very poor, the dialogues sound like they were written by a 13-year-old teenager, plotted (what plot?) Is another "excitement" where it is very difficult to get into. Finally, nothing in this movie is any good. A great thumb down to everyone involved and especially to the Montreal Film Festival, who presented this movie in competition!
