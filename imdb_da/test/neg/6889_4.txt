The video box for this movie reads "a story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruit". Are they talking about the same movie I've just seen?! They may not be when the movie I was so beautiful, but there was no passion and for the fruit it is all to happen to entice the potential viewer to watch this movie. If it had only a little passion or life for it, I would have enjoyed this movie very much. Instead, it was a painfully slow and not very interesting movie that I would definitely not see again. It is not that it is a bad movie (it is very beautifully filmed), but it is boring outside of faith. I was waiting for something exciting or interesting to do, but then the film ended. There was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything - just a rather unexciting story of a young girl who is serving and spending the next 10 years of her life working as a girl.
