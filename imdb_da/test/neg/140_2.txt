The success of the original French "Emmanuelle" series (I have only seen the first one that was not so bad to consider) led to a shadow of imitations; The Italian counterpart, which even changed its heroine, was obviously less polished and more exploitable - increasingly becoming vulgarity as the series joined. Amazingly, there were a total of 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies, where the heroine himself had spelled her name changed to avoid copyright issues !! Still, Laura Gemser - the titular object - became almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although she's personally too skinny for my taste)! Here she is even billed as "Emanuelle" rather than with her real name - with the director also becoming "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film gives a bit of interest: In fact, one would do the best to turn to it as a journey with some decent pictures of African wildlife. Regarding the sex scenes, I do not know how complete the version I was watching, but while there was a lot of nudity, none of it was very explicit - or even titillating (the scene approaching maybe when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turns on the camera, of course, sans clothes in the middle of the jungle)! The movie also includes an artist made to resemble Salvador Dali, but his compassionate may not take much of the time. The score by Nico Fidenco is typically gentle 70s pop and really nothing to write home about.
