The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a particular Hollywood prop. There is no concrete story. It goes from Venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter gets crazy for some reason that eventually gets it. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed everywhere with the outtaes of Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made some really good movies. Like all players, they must all have at least one bad movie. Don't waste $ 5.00 on the DVD.
