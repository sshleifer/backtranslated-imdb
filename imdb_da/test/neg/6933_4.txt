An O'Neill game of four and a half hours is boiled down to just under two, and much of the running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their cartoon's thoughts in voice-over. It may work on stage, but it looks hilarious in this soap opera adaptation, which softens its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she saw imprisoned so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, who are ridiculously overlooked, are classified by a naturalistic Clark Gable - he is the only one who does the frozen face technique work. It gets even more fun when Shearer and Gable's son, a surly mopped, makes the frozen face shtick. There is also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as a failed suitor, given to soliloquizing "poor Charlie!" over and over, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. When they come up, voice overs have been largely abandoned, and it plays like a mature soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is stodgy, and he shows a small plant for reining in hyperactive actors. It's certainly entertaining - there's nothing but that, unless you count Groucho's satirical parody of "Animal Crackers" or an old Mad Magazine satire that gave Shirley Booth's sitcom "Hazel" a la "Strange Interlude". But it's not good.
