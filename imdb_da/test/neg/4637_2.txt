This movie has been announced for over three months in Greece as the largest Greek production ever. Well, it could be, but ... When you hear about a great production, you expect to see something new, something else. What you see here is a movie for no reason in existence. George Corraface looks like he doesn't really enjoy making this movie. His play is so simplistic, it looks almost amateur. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?), Is full of elevator. The fortunately few, special effects that show Istanbul and Athens in the late 50s and early 70s are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) until 1968 (14 years), but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> So much for "the greatest Greek production". At least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. And all you get is a love story between 7-year-olds who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there's also a political side. A few ironic remarks about the Greek "junta" of '67 -'74, so childish that seems almost forced. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are a few good things in the movie: most of the actors are amazing, especially the Ieroklis Michaelidis, the very good nature and the magnificent music of Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such expensive production. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Is It A Bad Movie? To tell the truth I do not know. I just know that it in no way justifies its huge budget (for Greek standards).
