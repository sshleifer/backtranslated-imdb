Stranded in Space (1972) MST3K version - a very not good TV movie pilot, for a never to be made series, where an astronaut finds himself trapped on Earth's evil twin. Having a planet of the same size and mass of circuits in the same plane as the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun, is a well worn SF chestnut - the idea is over 2,000 years old, invented by ancient Greeks. In this version, Counter World runs as an Orwellian "perfect" society. Where, for completely unexplained reasons, everyone speaks English and runs late model American cars. After fleeing from his prison hospital, the disruptive terrestrial hunt for not southern California by television and the bad movie star Cameron Mitchell, who like his minions wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers - is a stylish evil combination that I fully intends to adopt if I become a totalitarian superior. Our hero escapes several times before they stop staring at the alien's three moons and wonder aloud if he ever comes home - thus creating one of them alone in a hostile world. Make a new friend every week but continue at the end of each episode so loved by the industry in the 70s and 80s ('The Fugitive', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'The Littlest Hobo', etc.) The Strangest Most strange bit, however, was the title sequence. Somewhere between 'Stranded in Space' first aeration (under the title 'The Stranger') in 1972 and the MST3K version in 1991 somehow made some recordings from the 1983 film 'The Prisoners of the Lost Universe'. So in 1991, the opening credits for 'Stranded in Space' run for a couple of shots of three people falling into a transmitter and disappearing. It is an order that has nothing to do - even thematically - with everything that follows. <br /> <br /> Just to add to the muddy B movie confusion, one of the actors in this nail film, Kay Lenz, later appeared in a 1994 movie called "Trapped in Space". Knowing this fact can never save your life, but it can score you very big points and admiring looks from other sweetie enthusiasts - if you could ever unfold a way to maneuver the conversation around to the point where you could slide it freely without look like a total idiot ...
