Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight-laced 1950s? By golly, this should be an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego Glenda. Somehow, if this movie was made now, I could see Kevin Kline playing Glen / Glenda. Note how all cross-dresser alter egos are versions of their male name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). It tries sympathetically to portray it as the psychological disorder it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. <br/> <br /> Somehow, Wood manages to sneak into bondage and S & M sequences in his first story of Glen / Glenda. Along with these racy scenes, Satan shows himself, of course, has a bad hair day. The dialogue and pace are non-existent, but the film is entertaining in its context - Ed Wood's weird world. <br /> <br /> Sterno says put on your favorite lip pants for this.
