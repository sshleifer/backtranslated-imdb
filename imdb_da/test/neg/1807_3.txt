Heart of Darkness Movie Review Could a book known for its eloquent formulation and complex concepts ever be made into a movie that is good enough to portray the profound significance of the book? So far, this goal has not been achieved. Darkness Heart was attempted to be made into a movie in 1993, but it was a mistake in relation to the book. It's hard enough to make a book in a movie. There is always concern that it will not be as descriptive or of equal importance. So why the novel, The Heart of Darkness, is made for a movie, I'm clueless. There is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the book. When I just read the words clearly, I think a person would think it was pretty boring and wouldn't get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the movie; the film just skimmed the story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't even follow the full book's full story, major changes were made, which I thought made the movie worse. For example, the manager did not go with the boat with Marlow and the rest of the crew, the spy did instead. I think some big plots were taken out and took the great fraud of the manager over Kurtz. Also, Kurtz wasn't even on the steam fight when he died, which made the whole journey even more in vain, which just became annoying after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fiance about his last moments and words, it wasn't as close as descriptive or important, her fiance wasn't so sad. <br /> <br /> As far as the actor went, none of the actors did a really good job except the actor who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz was not very bad, and that was an important thing in the book. Also other characters like Marlow, the manager and the fiance did not do the characters justice they deserved from the book. Their performance was not very exciting or memorable at all. Overall, I don't think this book should have been tried to be made into a movie. I think it's nice to use some of the themes in another story line as in Apocalypse Now. But to follow the same exact story line in the book, it's just shame.
