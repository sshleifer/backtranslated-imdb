This movie follows a very similar storyboard to The Warriors, only with less intensity and rather bad acting, which is nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> Generally, the story is not that bad, based on a little Aussie gang trying to get out of town when one of their members is framed for rape by another gang's girl. They then have to fight their way through the streets while being chased by a series of rival gangs. At suppose the authors have taken a page out of The Warrior's book and rewritten it, but as mentioned above - with almost no intensity. The action as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it is clearly clear that they actually appear ... the battle scenes do, however, make it, but the bad sound effects that accompany them bring it down again. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing on Once Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, okay history, bad deals, nothing to write home about.
