When I decided to try to watch a movie about cryogenic zombies, I didn't expect a lot. That's exactly what I got and even less. Apart from the lack of special effects (squibs?) And a serious lack of any acting talent, "The Chilling" also sports the absolute worst script I've ever seen made into a movie. I had to stop the tape several times over the first 45 minutes to repair the damage done to my intellect to witness such a terrible dialogue as here. <br /> <br /> Also, the collection of characters is so formal and one-dimensional it is ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know she is his "assistant" because he repeatedly refers to her with that title); The newly widowed businessman with a heart of gold that develops a romantic interest with Blair's character; his criminal son; The Blair character's alcoholic, violent, unemployed girlfriend we introduced to the best possible use of a flashback; And of course the hard, hard bearded security guard who becomes the hero. The awareness-raising fluid that some cryogenic laboratories use on their bodies is very conductive, which, of course, results in disaster when all laboratory containers end up outdoors in a remarkable order of events during a lightning (on Halloween night, no less). As for the zombies themselves, if you enjoy watching people in green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil suits, then "The Chilling" is the movie for you. The zombie action is very weak at its best; The zombies' primary killing method seems to seize people at their shoulders and shake them to death. The businessman and security guard do most of the zombie battle, including a very exciting scene to refreeze undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you that the "T2" steel factory has nothing on "The Chilling" to portray an enemy being frozen in his tracks like that. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair got stuck in the middle of this piece of drunk is actually a mystery. True, her career is not quite clouded during the 80s (unfortunately), but this film is embarrassing to her. Scripture does not even have a decency to put her into good use. Most of what her character is given to do is to scream things like "Here they come", "Do something", "Hurry!". The only thing I can count on is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this movie in rational food. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this picture, he faces fierce competition from his beard and security dog, and he does his best to outperform both of them. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of "The Chilling" is the introduction that brings up the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the movie you are watching could happen in your own community". When I counted the number of times repeated some of the names in the final credits, I became the floor to suddenly see Lucasfilm being credited. Fortunately, it was only for the film's audio production. 10.1.
