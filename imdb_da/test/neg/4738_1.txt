AVP2 is a horrible movie. The dialogue was pointless, the action was pathetic, it had almost no line of history, and you can't really tell what hell is going on half of the time due to continuity errors and plot holes. <br /> <br /> BUT! You will still love it. Because it pushes the boundaries of gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They even kill children, newborns, and unborn babies in this movie. You will sit there thinking "Oh my God, it's disgusting" And they surprise you by killing the "sexy chicken that always makes it alive" when predators and aliens fight in the hospital. <br /> <br /> It's like the movie industry has said "We know what we did in the first Alien vs Predator movie, was was bad so we do it again, but this time we get help from psychopaths alive fantasy." It is predictable, moronic and down right pointless .... but you will think about it for a while after you have seen it.
