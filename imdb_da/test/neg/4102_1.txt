In general, I will not review movies I have not seen for a while, so I will pop them in or hire them to give a full and fresh movie. In the case of 'A sound of thunder,' I remembered my promise never to see this movie ever again, so I just go to memory. In fact, I didn't think about how bad this movie was before I read someone else's review and remembered the experience I had back in 2005 when I actually saw this in the theater. My filmmate forced me to see it, even though I wasn't interested and wow. (Later, I forced him to see "Basic Instinct 2" in the theater and remind him that he made me see this shit. So I guess it did ourselves.) I definitely had my share of deep grin (at the expense of the movie , of course) which didn't make him happy as he really wanted to see it. Time-travel / butterfly effect movie had so many bad graphics, the highest chuckles from me were when they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved to see that dino and them are actually afraid of it? It was fun!) Or just Ben Kingsley. That's good, Kingsley can remind us how human actors can be: going from 'Gandhi' to 'Schindler's List' to this. (Even a Meryl Streep can make a "She-Devil" from time to time so they are forgiven.) For months I have drawn an MST3k with my girlfriend and consistently referred this movie to any low-rent sci-fi movie or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a good movie to watch drunk (or otherwise effortless): Terrible over-the-top acting, "special" FX that even Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that Razzies did not even nominate this movie for any price.
