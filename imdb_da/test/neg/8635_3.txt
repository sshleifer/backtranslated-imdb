George Sluizer's original version of The Vanishing aka Man, who wanted to know, offers one of the most silent disturbing sociopaths of European film and one of the most memorable finals of all time (shamelessly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume Two ), but it has many more to offer than that. Play around with chronology and invert the usual clich√©s of standard 'lady vanishes' plotters, it also provides excellent characterization and strong, underpicking but convincing beliefs. Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it came to remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else would have the chance to destroy his movie, as he was quite capable of doing it himself, but few people could have expected how extensive he destroys his own work. His career has never been restored from this catastrophic failure. Chief Culprit is an astonishing achievement by Jeff Bridges who has been thought through all the details to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest films noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him and thought about what he was doing and this film is a proof of pudding. Each movement is far too mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rustic clockwork, while his voice is a bizarre mix of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all taken electorations from Dok-tah E-ville . There is no hacking of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head and saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your consideration." But the blame must really be handed out here. None of the performances are good: often they do not even look good. Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a confused man on his wits ending in the hurried scenes at the petrol station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock giving no impression as the object of his obsession. Not that they get any help from either instructor or author Todd Graff. Scripture is particularly weak. The chronology has been changed to put the focus on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush, the movie is in, the drainage of life and character from each scene in its run to get to the next. Instead of the high / low mood swings in the couple's relationship or the seemingly relaxed but careful creation of the emotion, we get just a few arguments that give you the impression that he is better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending ?? Standard Woman Hunted By Nutter In The Forest Endangered Stuff Complete With Lame 'Let's End A Joke As A TV Cop Show' Moment ?? best not go there ?? which is advice that holds this whole train of a movie. Even a shockingly dull and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this.
