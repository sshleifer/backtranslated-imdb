One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their "love" of each other. They don't seem to be interested in much, but each other, and only passively so. I was left to cuddle me. Most of the exterior scenes take place at night so you can't even enjoy well-lit sights in Paris! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
