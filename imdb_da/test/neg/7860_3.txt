While there is much to recommend about Maetel Legend both in concept and finished product, it is ultimately a bad movie. In short, it is a story about Maetel's early life, which is usually unclear; At the same time, the authors use the opportunity to tell the story of the machine rule. And when Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other work, we get the starting point for Emeraldas her sister, Her mother: Queen of La Metalle and a little Galaxy Express 999 to exhibit the movie. In short, Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular circuit, which means that its cycle around the nearest sun reaches a cold stage and it is artificial Sun dies. Planet grows ever colder throughout history, thus increasing the sense of punishment. To protect her subjects and family, the Queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of La Metalles people. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg that provides the means for the job. Through the film, the characters are left to question mechanization, will they still be human? Can Hardgear be trusted? Do souls and hearts remain? So for a fan of Matsumoto's work there is much to enjoy, questions to be answered, themes continue, except it is obvious that the film should be an introduction as well as a fan of curiosity. The negatives, especially the animation, while the Galaxy Express 999, a television series from over 20 years ago has creepy mouth animation and sometimes outlined character design, Maetel Legend has all the worst features of modern animation and thus earns an air of respect for Galaxy Express 999. The design is well-detailed, but unfortunately, the animation has little left behind drawn characters that "slip", which in the background moves or the camera zooms, a quick way to animate. But the few, yes, a few animated scenes are repeatedly used in dream sequences, repetition and in extra scenes. Anyone who watches movies will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Next story, while in concept, sounds good, the finished product is actually a series of conversations of plot repeated over and over for small power, the number of times the characters encounter the same issues And learning the same things, is almost insulting to the audience and the characters who seem to articulate much more in earlier incarnations. Add to all this something terrible character design that seems lifeless, exaggerated, and the audience is left with a movie that has missed it, it might as well have been rewritten as another movie, at least the novices won't be abandoned . <br /> <br /> And yet it really has its moments, the end is at least surprising. The situation of the citizens of La Metalle was quite affected and rightly disturbing; I think I find the whole human-machine theme disturbing. It is hard to know who will recommend Maetel Legend as it is not well animated, written or executed, plus confusing when Leiji Matsumoto's mandatory cross reference is introduced. But I can't help but light up when the magnificent entrance to Tre Nine appears, now it's a good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you're a fan.
