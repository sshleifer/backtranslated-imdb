This movie is so bad that I have wasted too much time, already talking about it. So bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even critical ... I'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen ... Sandra's few minutes show you how far she has really done It ... I really mean something next to this is really Oscar worthy of her ... I suppose the only way for her to look at it is that there is no way but up to it. .. I suppose she had to start somewhere ... but really ... so bad ... ... awful really ... bad is too good a word for this s ** t .... but I don't want to make sense now ... but really how can you not after wasting 90 minutes ... 90 minutes in my life that I never come back ... 90 minutes I could have spent something better ... like to sit on my ass and stare into the room .. it would have been time better spent ... (going away shaking head)
