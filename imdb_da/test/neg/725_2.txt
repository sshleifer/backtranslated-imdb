It has been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and I agree. <br /> <br /> If mother and daughter were so sharp, they should be queen and princess of the universe, not kicking around in a small town. <br /> <br /> I have really tried to see some episodes, but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drifts, I begin to flip the channel. <br /> <br /> I saw a bit of a new episode to see if something had changed (the better I had hoped) but no, the same old "we're so clever with our references to pop culture" that I almost barfed. <br /> <br /> Long-term fans are not happy with the newer seasons, can only be awake and get sick of the regurgitated dad who never stops.
