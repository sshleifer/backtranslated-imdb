Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), a hammy cult icon, dies of a heart disease (not before the disposal of an ungrateful assistant and television commercial director, both of whom respected him with disturbances). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students (they want to "invite him to dinner" .. they are quite big fans). What these children (including a young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to destroy those who removed him from his resting place. <br /> <br /> The list of violent acts includes Radzoff, who pulls out a guy's tongue, sets a woman on fire, lifts a coffin that crushes a woman's face, decapitates a guy and creams another guy in a coffin. A really strange soundtrack and annoying fog wraps Radzoff's ghoulish activities. <br /> <br /> The Silly hokum from Troma is limited by a very, very low budget and slow pace. The film feels much longer than it is. The movie is not so cute, and we can hardly see much violence, because the film is often too horrible dark. At times, Radzoff is an eerie presence, but at other times he just looks really silly.
