The most disturbing thing about this movie isn't that it's a load of hogwash (the CPUSA was never as much a spying threat as the movie does). The disturbing aspect is the way in which it laundered the absolutely scary tactics of the FBI and the un-American activities committee. Secret informants, gossip became accusations, unfounded searches - these are the kinds of things secret police officers that the KGB did, and probably what the good patriotic Americans were fighting for. Still, the FBI made them and didn't mind. It is the only realistic part of this movie and they present it without any shame at all. Add to this undermines the constitution itself by having only Communists invoked the bill. The film also blatantly blames allegations that the black civil rights movement was communist-inspired, another package of lies. It is extremely difficult today to apologize for such monstrous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of time when you realize how harmful it was to real people then.
