I read many hopes from the book's readers that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Robert's story. Not having read the book, I do not know if this adaptation was faithful, but I know it was not good. In fact, the manuscript was the best part of the movie, so kudos to Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and looked at Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure she's a good actress. She has been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this. But Forlani was not alone. The performances were everywhere. Oliver Hudson was wood and boring. Josie Davis was hammy. Then, in the midst of all this B-bet, there is Jacqueline Bisset! She didn't have much to do other than portray bitterness, but even sleeping through it, she was miles ahead of the others. <br /> <br /> Forlani is still one of the most breathtaking women in movies and I was not disappointed in that capacity here. I think Forlani can be more than eye-candy, but until she gets a good performance in a good movie, she continues to excel. And I still want to see everything she participates in. Fandom is fun that way. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was Carolina Moon, which was pretty bad. In addition to the bad actions (fake southern accents are really distracting), the direction was pedestrian. It wasn't terrible. It was just the boring television caliber you're used to watching life. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of any of the stars, you'll probably enjoy Carolina Moon for the reason I did. If you are a fan of the book, you may like to see the story on the screen, albeit in a lacquered form. Otherwise, this movie is unremarkable.
