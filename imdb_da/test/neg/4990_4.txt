They did it again: ripped an old shows title and then destroyed nostalgia with dull "re-enacted" things. '60's cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of superhero comics. The character was drawn as a 1/2 way between animal and human, as Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle; It's about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. <br /> <br /> Most of the clever schtick who made the original show fun is missing from this movie. Instead, we get a clumsy expo dog that is even more dumb than Cad. And some pet owners who don't add anything to the story. Cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). Bad scripting. A stereotypical dwarf plays Simon Bar Sinister. The gravelly noise box guy they employed to vote underdog is painful. You would think they had at least had a voice impressionist approach the Wally Cox's humorous distinctive voice to Underdog. But no. There are at least a couple of loving references to the source material (like rhyming lines) that lift it to a 4. <br /> <br /> Only small children who love dogs can enjoy this. Everyone else should get a DVD of the original comic book series. See this only in desperation.
