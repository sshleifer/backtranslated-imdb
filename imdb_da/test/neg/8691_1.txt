Does anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? - Or what happens to them? - I doubt it. That's the key problem - for a tragedy to work we must take care of at least one of the characters, and none of them inspires any sympathy or seems to have any redeeming qualities at all. <br /> <br /> What may have worked in the 16th century certainly doesn't work when you can only assume 'post-apocalyptic Liverpool' if that was right what it was supposed to be. The problem is the signs of post-apocalyptic Liverpool while still driving around in cars, using cell phones and watching television, having returned to speaking in Shakespeare language - with a Liverpudlian dialect. Oh God! Bad enough you might think - but it often goes into pure scouse - with comments like 'uh lah are you a cockney? And was it a Merseyrail message under one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Now the good news is that in the post-apocalyptic Liverpool trains are still running. <br /> <br /> The characters without exception are poorly drawn, wood and more like caricatures in line with the Joker / Penguin in Batman and Robin except that there is no real story to talk about - or if there is - it is one that does not work in a modern setting where half of the sets are gloomy and 'Blade runnerish' and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal. Costumes are also mixed with half wearing their daily clothes (Parkers are great in post-apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wears costumes from the remains of a fancy dress party? <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of desire, incest and revenge in the most inanimate way imaginable - The tragedy is that this film was made at all. <br /> <br />
