I watched it because it seemed that the plot went somewhere. Since it was ambiguous, I was very disappointed. I'll tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I don't want to. Maybe I'll just mean something will happen. The authors lacked any imagination. This is not even a "B" movie - it is made for TV "B" movie.
