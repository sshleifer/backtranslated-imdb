I am almost a two decade old man who has read comics most of my life. I'm not a big fan of Fantastic Four, but I'm pretty familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (B-film legend) produced the first I think feature length Fantastic Four movie. The result was such a pure schlock that it was never given a release. There are still copies, mainly online and on conventions. If you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy, do yourself a favor and check this thing. <br /> <br /> The film basically tells FF's origins and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain named The Jewelery, mostly Mole Man with a penchant for petty larceny. As is the case with these comic films, everything must be tied to everything so that FF plays a crucial role in Dr. Doom's creation and he and the jeweler play a crucial role in theirs. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would just like to mention that despite everything that went wrong in this movie, I actually liked the guy who played Doom. He doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does, he hits them. The hood also looks good. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad plot, bad acting, bad effects, bad all basics. Boos especially to Jay Underwood who brings new meaning to the word overactive like Johnny Storm. He doesn't override, he screams. <br /> <br /> As far as FF is concerned, they all look straight and Sue is played by a very attractive actress, but they just don't look like a real team. For one thing, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to enter the room. In an early section, Ben and Reed go to visit the two, Johnny is like 8 and Sue is about 12. It only stands to make their any romantic mating a helluva lot of scare. Thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not particularly rocket, and the only time Human Torch is really a human torch, he looks like Silver Surfer toned red. <br /> <br /> I could write for hours, but I think the scene that best summarizes it is a climatic encounter with the above-mentioned non-human flare. He runs a laser beam and he destroys it with a stroke. Yes, a blow. A laser beam. With a stroke. Then he flies around and goes "Yippeee!" a whole lot, after which the camera settles down and he flies back to the weather. Obviously, Reed the intellectual forgot to enlighten Johnny that the fire does not exist in the room's vacuum. This and many other scenes act as Looney Toones, if the character does not know they are over a rock, they do not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was glad it was never released.
