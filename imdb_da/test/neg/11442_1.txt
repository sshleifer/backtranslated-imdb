"Catchfire" or "Backtrack" as it is sometimes called is not very good. That is, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this time. Why did she go in to do this? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship between hostages and kidnappers is not credible, although it is a common psychological phenomenon in reality. Worst of all, this movie features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which means traffic should stop so the bridge could open. I had to wait for that bridge to go down many times, almost everyone on the bus. It's not a pleasant wait. This movie caused unnecessary bridge waiting, and the world is a worse place for it.
