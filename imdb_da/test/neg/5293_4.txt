Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One should think that this star pair of great actors could really warm up this movie, but no. Travolta again takes on the role of Chili Palmer, but this time we have already seen the gangster trying their luck in the tough world of film making, it's not fun anymore. This is a typical problem in Hollywood, they think if the first one was good, the other would be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the other could not be, Hey Hollywood trying to understand originality could not be duplicated , you have to give us a new twist, not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget. I have constantly found myself. Almost laughing when I watched this movie, but still it has a lot of cool actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock and just for that and that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
