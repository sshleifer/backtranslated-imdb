Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good television director with a few good full lengths for his credit, "Homegrown" is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite performances by Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, a cast this good could not save the movie. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics wants to know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but you can't see Jake very well, and Maggie is only in it for 30 seconds as a babysitter who overthrows Lithgows sign of a bust. It's not even a lowbrow pot comedy that the movie was meant to be. It was just not fun.
