What I miss most of all in this movie is that it doesn't make room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary, but not as good as a documentary because it's not a documentary. A patch film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film already tells you what to think. Too many different problems are affected, but no one is prepared to make you think. I don't even know if it's a fun movie that will be serious or a serious movie that will be fun. Many scenes are very unrealistic, and the play is rather poor. The movie is pretty boring.
