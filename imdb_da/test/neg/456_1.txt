One is a very appropriate name show, mostly because it comes close to being the only network showing in prime time that hardly more than one person sees. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about one thought to myself "Weee !! Another sing-song show! We don't have enough of them!" and then proceeded with the strap on my helmet and ran around my home hitting my head on dumb objects and sharp corners. Because the constant, annual pain and suffering of having only one or two "talent" -based reality exhibitions running, it's probably not enough. We needed another. And not just anyone - "IT". The one with slightly less attractive participants with a little less talent. The one with a little less point, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario where possible. One with meaningless recordings of the participants when they are not playing. Because I don't care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his off hours! I really do! Now you might think "Hey! On the whole continent of North America, under 4 million people saw the first episode." Doesn't that mean this show sucks? "Now I say that less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news now they don't. Think about it. Ultimately, one can be terribly unoriginal, a show that even the aeration network doesn't could be bothered to promote because they also realize how absolutely worthless it is, but it is still not syphilis! Yay!
