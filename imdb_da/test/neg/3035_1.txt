This film really lacks the mark on most fronts. The accents are ridiculously weak, the acting amateur and comedy weak at best. <br /> <br /> They have a good idea, it could have been especially comfortable, but for the reasons mentioned above. The author seems to think by putting the word f * ck in each sentence, it will make it more fun and the protagonist just seems to try a little too hard. He's no Brick top, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The next time, at least, a cast will keep the accent on the whole movie. It is a crime to compare this with films like the Company, Lock Stock and Snatch.
