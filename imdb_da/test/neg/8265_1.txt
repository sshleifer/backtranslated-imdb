This episode was boring and wasn't even in the realm of horror, so far this season Masters of Horror has produced a really good episode ... The condemned thing ... it's still early, I believe the episodes are getting better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay, but lacked a solid story. The episode about the couple who captured the serial killer began to be bored, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. Although I'm just disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possess. Please save this season John Carpenter! I believe that Pro-Life will solve the entire dark season so far. <br /> <br /> "You're an angry little elf!"
