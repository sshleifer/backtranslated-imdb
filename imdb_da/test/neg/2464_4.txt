Jack Black and Kyle Gass play fantasy versions by themselves in this cartoon show for their side-band Tenacious D, an art rock outfit with satirical, barbed lyrics. A predecessor obsessed with heavy metal and a beach-living pot-smoker slacker who pretends to be a rock god, meets and forms a band (the birthmarks of both of their lady's constituting the group's moniker). Opening with a fun prologue that apes a Twisted Sister video from the 80s, "The Pick of Destiny" is a fairly well-produced movie aimed at older children; it is occasionally no more than a middle-aged variation of "Wayne's World", with jokey stoner interludes and a climactic bout with Beelzebub itself, but Black and Gas has a hugely pleasurable report (they have also acted as producers, wrote scripts and all over the music). The target group will of course go for it, although the inspiration is a little low, especially in the second half (about the time our heroes are impulsively running from the police in a student driver car). The music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire, and in the first thirty minutes Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 from ****
