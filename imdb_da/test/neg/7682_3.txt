Sorry people, I love Ray Bolger's work, but the only thing he is not is a leading man. Maybe if you seem to be the last man on earth, this romantic plot can work, but come on! <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that exists just to showcase the title song, which was a big hit for Basie Band the year before (1951). And some beautiful singing and dancing saved it from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> But the story is pathetic, even after the 1952 musical comedy standards. And the other songs are just as forgetful as the Evening In Paris cologne. The dialogue scares the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin's Boyeresque charm keeps its character three-dimensional. So how do you enjoy this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A. Fast forward through all dialogue ... <br /> <br /> B. Surrender yourself to Doris Days vocals and Ray Bolger's runaway footwork. And don't miss the Dauphin's hilarious pursuit of a rainy, blown-out version of "April In Paris" ... C.) Finally, keep a few bottles of Cabernet cool and practical. <br /> Bob Raymond
