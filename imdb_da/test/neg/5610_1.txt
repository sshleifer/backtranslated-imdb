If only the author / producer / "star" had the slightest imposition of the limits of his scope, and the way he perceived on the screen (wearing glasses and side divisions is not enough to make you look and look, if your face and teeth have been sculpted by various medical professionals to adhere to the American ideals of generic, characterless symmetry, mistakenly perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society) he would have thrown John Heder as the protagonist instead of trying to draw a goodwill. Hunting and creating a vehicle to showcase his ... his ... well though. <br /> <br /> The brilliant caste (Lord, they must have trouble accepting this) is wasted in a disturbing eternal battle to respond convincingly to a protagonist who is unable to deliver even the simplest line with appropriate intonation, and believe me, he is not short of simple lines to choose from, as the dialogue appears to be composed of a five-year-old. Ah wait ... it's the same person pretending to be an author pretending to be an actor. It is not often that I do not see a movie through to the end, but this ejaculation was irrevocable from the beginning and showed no signs of improvement after the first hour. Droppings.
