Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: empty house beside abandoned mine in tragic past forest; the family moves into the house and strange things begin to happen; small creepy children begin to appear here and there are creepy toddlers. But this is where wisdom and potential fun end. This group of children were sealed in the mine many decades earlier, and now it seems to be roving the forest (bad makeup) with weapons seeking meat to eat. Oh, I understand, it's a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm .... while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, it just didn't work. What was the children's motivation to try to consume meat? Why did they need weapons? Did others suggest that the filmmakers all gathered around the daily giggling footage because they felt this would be a cool / scary movie? I found out that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar departure that I had just wasted my time on another modern crap party. While the play was good, and also the setting / good quality cinematography, the script itself, what seems to lack knowledge about the supernatural horror genre. A bunch of children walking down the mall is frightening than this pack of badly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, and although I can appreciate the story, I may have even had it if I had read it Instead of seeing it, I still have to say that malicious little ones Things are more precisely called Wicked Little Turd.
