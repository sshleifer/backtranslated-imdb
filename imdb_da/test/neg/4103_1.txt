My friend recommended this movie to me. It should have known not to see it because my friend is a kind of video game geek. But the name and the cover made it good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean, first of all, what's with their suits? And the actor! It seems they got people out of Barney. Except Ben Kingsley. And why was he himself in this movie? He thought it was a comedy! But I have to say that the special effects were pretty good. But that was the only good thing about it. I seriously think the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And that's actually an understatement. Everyone must have thought "Oh, I'm being paid, so it doesn't matter if it's the worst movie in the world." I would understand why anyone would make this kind of movie if they direct, act, produce, write and get their hopeless life the best friend to make movies and edit. Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies ever. A really jacked up movie
