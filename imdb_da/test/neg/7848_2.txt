This must be one of MGM's and FRANK SINATRAS's worst movies. An oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect. Silly plot, SINATRA has been trying to continue its father's reputation as a KISSING BANDIT. He is no bandit and does not kiss !! He also plays the "nerdy" character that one might expect from the dialogue he is going to speak. The stage performer is J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they didn't have more scenes together. I have given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs song by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is where you find it" is sensational. Could have had a mention of one. Also a comic type dance number by RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER if it's fun. So for those reasons and only the reasons it is easy to see. KISSING BANDIT is part of Frank Sinatra's early years collection.
