I looked at cheats some years ago with my friend. He hyped it up as a great fun movie that is one of the best comedies ever. I think he was on the crack or something. I just recently learned that this movie was not released to theaters, I can understand why perfect. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of guys cheating on virtually all their tasks in school to get good grades. It is the main problem with this movie that the morals are all bad. There are other teenage comedy films where the students do bad things, but it is usually things that do not happen in school. So I think the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids cheating on everything is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I also didn't like the characters in this movie. The main character of the guy is a completely slick arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. In fact, I am not sure if you could say there is a protagonist because they all cheat in school, which is wrong. The other supporting signs were not fun at all and basically threw the cast into this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad message and even worse plays and characters. There are other teenage films that are far better than this movie. So you don't have to watch this and that's a good thing because I don't even recommend this movie at all.
