Imagine all stereotyped, exaggerated clich√©s from all Brooklyn movie and television shows in the streets between 1930 and 1980. Develop it with a draft of interchangeable caricatures instead of the actual characters. Throw in a mix of "period" music and miserable electric guitars during "rumble" scenes. Then, the time passes by trying to find out (or care for) which of the dices will be killed in the (anti) climactic last rumble. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie points not to be just another romantic comedy, teenage glasses, explosive action movie, teenage comedy, kiddie musical or Oscar nominee vehicle. But bringing something new or interesting to the street-gang tragedy genre may have been nice.
