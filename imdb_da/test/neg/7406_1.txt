I can't believe how bad this "movie" is. Initially, the film is about the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and having Lance Henriksen in cast (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising perspective. Unfortunately, it is just as interesting as it gets. This looks like a direct DVD release ... or I guess. This is basically a production-free affair with probably the worst editing (with a constant "fading to black" between each scene !!!) I've seen in my life and acting that will surely make you hug. Why Lance Henriksen picked this one is completely greasy. And the film captures almost any other genre movie, from the "Blair Witch Project" and the "Predator" to "Alive". This is supposedly based on true events, but the only truth that exists here is just how bad this movie is. I'm not usually a tough critic and believe in me, I tried to enjoy this trash can, but ultimately it didn't. Do yourself a favor and remove from this DVD. <br /> <br /> I'll try to say the least: This movie is CLEAN WASTE and it has caused me to take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER for a refund !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, shame on you! 1 * out of 10 *
