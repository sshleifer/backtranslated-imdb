Steven Seagal's intention is to be praised, and his performance in this movie is similar to that of many of his others if you ignore the fact that he allegedly imagines a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two points of the plot, which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the break point. First, how is it a carefully constructed variation on an unpleasant germ whose antidote should be as carefully researched and constructed by a large laboratory, healed by drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains? and that grandfather's family seems to be the only one who knows anything about this? <br /> <br /> Other and this one really takes the cake: Having gathered enough cure to fix a whole city, it wouldn't be Expecting the army to land the helicopter and start rushing flower bags to every home in this little town? No, they decide instead to sprinkle the flowers all over the city and force the sick people to go out and pick them up again. Just stupid, unless under native belief, the power of the drug somehow depends on having gone out and gathering the flowers themselves. <br /> <br /> Add in the shovel's crap and titles' unsuitability, and you may think my vote on this movie is actually high.
