This movie looked like it was rushing to get away for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So incredible. The scenes where the president (Holbrook) was downtown and walked among the people was a farce. There would be no chance that the common folk music would be within 30 meters of the president in the real life situation. If it wasn't for the blood and the ghost, this shot was like a television movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrooks (president) talents were never realized in this movie. Shatner's play is okay. The production values ​​in this film leave much to be desired. All in all, I think most would be better not to waste time watching this affair.
