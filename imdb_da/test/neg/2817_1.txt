Kill the scream queen may sound like a good slasher flick, but it's terribly dull and very stupid. <br /> <br /> Killing the scream queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditiones girls to be in his snus movie. He rapes and tortures them. These are the rubbish bin that is not fun, exciting or entertaining. The killer has no motive, okay, maybe he's just sick ... and very boring. Maybe they could give a victim a story of their own. Something could be an improvement. It needed a lot more. <br /> <br /> They could only put a little more into it. I love horror / slasher movies, but it's ridiculously bad.
