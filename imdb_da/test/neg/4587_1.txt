This movie goes into my "Worst Films Ever Made" file. I have a copy of this movie that I see when I want a good laugh, and it's not even a comedy. I am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a waste. This movie is inaccurate (in its hockey show), offensive (to Canadians), and I wasn't even all that impressed the actor. Even the story was a little weak. If you've never seen this movie, you have luck. If you have, I'm sorry.
