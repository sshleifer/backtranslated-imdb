You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or serial pilot or what it was supposed to be to find out what is in the store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this is not the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles and Sal Mineo, the writing is terrible and the story is constructed, filled with spooky stereotypes and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey. Why should Hollywood always present stories from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all unidimensional morons? It is far too bad that such an interesting era in our unusually conforming social experience is generally depicted by out and about waste, so the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes close to it. way, things really were. The best I've seen to date is a memoir called Looking Back by a guy named Becker, but who has even heard of it? Nobody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They're busy pushing tripe like this groaner off a movie to interfere with reality.
