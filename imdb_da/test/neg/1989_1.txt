This movie is worse than "Heaven's gate" or "Plan 9 from outer space". Don't know why it got an Oscar, it should have got a million raspberries, just like the audience who either went out or didn't come up in the first place. The hospital was a prime financial failure, but I am sure the left-wing elite classes, boy-mouthed intellectuals, that the American public was far too plebeic to appreciate biting social comments when they saw it, and on and on. George C Scott, in one of the most artificial and embarrassing roles, along with the aging sex symbol Diana Rigg, uses most of the film that tries to cuss in an increasingly blasphemous way as they push along a stupid plot. Bad old George is impotent and is just crushed by the event, but after many dirty languages ​​between him and Rigg, he raps several times on a nice night in a dirty, crumbling NYC hospital that looks so scary that I don't want a dying pet rat treated in it. There is also a lot of sacred junk dialogue cast on hither and yon, twisted with lots of cussing too. It ends by depicting the erroneous notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always causes cardiac arrest. Will never see another moment of this horrible movie again.
