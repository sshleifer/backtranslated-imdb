This film comes down as a square stick in a square hole. A badly made stick. A point so cheap it couldn't even be portrayed in a sweatshop assembly line in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, when you try to push the pin into the hole as it is clearly designed for, it crumbles into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and won't wash off. Quigly is such a stick. <br /> <br /> This movie is so much fun, it couldn't even be created. A movie like this must have been the result of some kind of natural accident; a freakish unit that stuck in the corner of a roof office somewhere and attached and grew until it was too big and scary to look at. Only science would be interested in such a thing; Anyone who did not bend to study it would exhume it from this world. What it comes down to is this: if you are the kind of enjoying first-year violin considerations, racism or cola zero Just be your birthday.
