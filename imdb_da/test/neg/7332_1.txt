This guy is a real job. An angry, immature boy in an adult man's body packing all the charisma of a stone he walks around to places that most people only want to visit and do their best to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone who actually appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could go down an infinite list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes", though I just want to highlight the worst: Crete. While the locals are portraying the sea in their "glory", this clown has the lunatic to act as a disgraceful, spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion feeling of the people who live there. What a carefree. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes failing adultery on a bunch of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talking to some dimwit Americans as a job) because they didn't think that Abba was horrible. Everywhere he went, he took Abba up. This is the kind of talk you want to hear from 13-year-olds who overlook MTV. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he was worried that a particular restaurant had better tasting fries than his, so he "accidentally" wasted some wine on them to destroy them. What a strange, emotionally unstable person. The worst of it all is his clumsy voice overflows, attempting in vain to add a perspective to a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. He tries to use all these "big" words to sound like a writer, but he is really just a pretentious hack whose lack of consciousness has convinced him that he has something to say. It's probably the only good thing about this joker's TV show. It is possible to show you, no matter how inconsiderate you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will. <br /> <br /> There is the way he speaks to local guides whose English is, of course, only rudimentary. He will use vocabulary any writer - whom he believes to be - would instinctively know will probably not be understood by these people. Does he break? No. Self-meaning schmucks like this Bourdain clown do not use language to communicate; They use it to make them look important. Mcg13jthm's review on the same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind Bourdain attracts - with a low IQ social misfit. Be aware how the reviewer tries to justify Bourdain's sociopathic nature with simple, childish excuses that hardly make sense. "Bourdain must complain, but he goes through" a lot "and not just what he was" forced "to do this show, but tries to redeem himself." A hidden attraction is hidden, and reading Mcg13jthm's review should tell you well whether you are the kind of person who will enjoy this completely useless, pointless show. Finally, to add a bit of "fairness" to my diatribe, I admit Bourdain would have been a little entertaining if I had met him in a bar. But as a television host for a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a miserable, eerie, hopeless, gloomy and depressing failure. A failure.
