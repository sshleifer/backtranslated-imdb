When I saw Alien vs Predator a couple of years ago, I must say as stupid as a sequel, it was, it was still some fun. Now there is unfortunately a lack of good movies out in the theater lately, so my boyfriend and I decided to just go ahead and see what AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem was all about. So we saw it a couple of nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing exciting about this horror sequel. It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie, it is not a bad idea to take Alien and Predator and put them in the suburbs of the class, but from the idea of ​​the first one explaining their causes to existing it was just an average and predictable horror. Not to mention a story that continues to introduce new characters every scene where I was not sure who should remember who was the protagonist and why, so I couldn't really keep up with the story. <br /> <br / From what I have gathered, of course, the predator and the alien are in space who have to deal with things of typical sit com neighbors, they just turn the lights off and they decide why not? Go ahead and take it out on some Earthlings. So they crash and Alien takes over the suburbia utopia. But teenagers, including an uneasy couple that looks like Ken and Barbie, a female navy and her daughter will, among other things, make some kicks of space, that is, if the predator does not come there first. Because he's crossed by Alien, I'm guessing to start the party without him, lol, just fool, actually to kill some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie of any standard, it's still pretty cool with many of the visual effects and the fighting sequences between Alien and Predator are so cool to see. As the first successor of Alien vs. Predator, what destroys the movie and just seems like they were not well-developed, I know it's horror, but the original Alien and Predator movies had characters you cared for and wanted to win . But it was a semi-decent sequel that I would say is worth looking for some fun, especially for Ken and Barbie's sake. <br /> <br /> 4/10
