"The Best Movie of the 90's" "The Welsh Trainspotting" .... Aye, right! I went into this movie with quite high expectations and it was all the way down from there. <br /> <br /> This film was to be this archetypal film of drug culture in the early 90s and would allow us everything to look inside this scene and destroy the media assumptions following the moral panic that followed Leah Betts died in 1995. Unfortunately, it has fallen far away. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult in the subject, and potential issues surrounding fabrics, this just gave us a little schmaltzy tale of the drug addict and how it likes you who completely open your mind. Cue some guff about Bill Hicks and Howard Mark's nausea. It is painfully bad at times. I think the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt actually made me laugh aloud. <br /> <br /> Now I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip leads us through this story is like listening to THAT Acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party talking to you about how the "man" holds us back and how Acid has released him from the tribes of modern society. You will just shake some sense into him and ask him to leave the premises. <br /> <br /> The scripture was a real problem for me because Trainspotting had the quirky book by Irvine Welsh, written and written by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of all trades, master of none" come to mind. You can see where his inspiration comes from, especially in the style of the story from the protagonist Jip (who puts the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and outlines what goes through his mind as the scenario plays out) The problem with This is that some of the speakers for the camera are just painful to see. Mostly, this comes to a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average A-Level drama project. The direction is good and the intentions are good, but it is so insufficient that you start to wonder what hype is about. <br /> <br /> But that's not all bad. There are moments that are really very fun and entertaining. Moff is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent film, it also succeeded in attracting a large number of British actors / actresses, who might describe why there was so much fun about the movie. <br /> <br /> Best films from the 90s? Not with a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid sundowned movie, then it can only be your bag. It is inevitable that the film is flawless of the hype surrounding it.
