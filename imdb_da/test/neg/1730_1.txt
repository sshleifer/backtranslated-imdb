Horrendous! I'm a teenager and I don't mind teen movies, but it's terrible! Aaron Carter plays this pop star called JD McQueen and to keep his characters up or something, he works with the 'nerd, Jane whateverherlastnameis. But the 'substantial girls' are too predictable, and so the clothes most of the girls in the film are not realistic. How would any of these girls get away with wearing no bra, tube sheets and shirts that expose their stomachs? IN HIGH SCHOOL? At my school we would be sent home to something like that. <br /> <br /> And part of the movie where JD's lyrics Jane, she says' Sleep tight? He must believe I'm an idiot! I didn't know subtitles were so stressful! 'How is texting stressful? And where Jane is with JD and how he 'falls in love with her' is very stupid. The dialogue is cheeses and stupid, the play is terrible. the music is fun and the plot is indefinite. <br /> <br /> For tweeny boppers who still love Aaron Carter, you'll enjoy it. If you're a casual watcher like me, it's NOT the movie for you
