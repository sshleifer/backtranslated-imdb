I could not believe it. This movie was a total waste of time out of my life. The title is appropriate. Love didn't blow hell out of me, this movie did. I continued to look and see and wait and wait and hope for something to happen. And nothing ever happened! Nothing!! Terrence Howard couldn't even save this lame job called a movie. It was dark and confused, and I didn't get who killed the girlfriend in the end. The tone and pacing of the film had to be built for a dramatic climactic ending. This only served to confuse the audience because the movie just plodded along goes no where. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
