This movie entertained me with lots of laughs about the actors who kept the movie moving together in all kinds of crazy directions. If you like suggestive languages ​​and sexy looking, they were all in the picture, and gals and guys all look burned out before they even finish from high school. There is a scene where teens drive their car to a very fake deer and then continue to throw it into a lake or sea that is repeated over and over. There is no horror of this movie except the word Horrible for the whole picture, and Arnold who plays a plastic politician is really a sick character. Don't waste your time watching this movie.
