It's fun where instinct warns you about something. For example, as soon as company credits read Nu Image, I instinctively knew that I had seen a real crap movie of them somewhere before, but couldn't remember where. Nevertheless, I just knew that JUDGE AND JURY should be shed and that was. Maybe I'm mental? <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is quite violent with more people being blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know about you, but I get a bit of power with the violent on-screen violence today with bad language, especially if it is spat by actors as bad as those in this movie. Still, the plot is about the bad guy being executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh do I mention the bad guy and his wife murdered a few people on their wedding night? Yes he is a serious badass mofo. In fact, he is so bad (and I don't mean that act - I come to it in a moment) that he is impossible to take seriously, and that is before he is executed only to return as Elton John, Elvis, a French cook, etc. I wonder if Keith David was paid for this? Because he sees what he has so much fun on the screen, that's the only reason he plays the role. What a shame this reviewer did not have any fun at seeing JUDGE AND JURY. Hey maybe the producers could send me Keith's fee? Gawd only knows that I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie much like you hadn't guessed, and my head meat is not with the stupid plot or the cheap production values, but with its attitude to violence. If you have had a wine bottle torn over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times, then you know that violence is an indecent painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY want you to believe that if you are thrown through a window crash through some bannists and fall twenty odd feet on a table, not only will you be unheard of, but you will be able to run out of a few healthy devil dogs. It could of course be argued that any movie with Sly, Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest show of violence, but with JUDGE AND JURY it killed my chain
