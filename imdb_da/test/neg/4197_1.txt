This is definitely the most stupid movie ever produced in front of the camera. I can't believe I was enough to rent this piece of junk. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but it takes the cake .... Ice cream ,,,, and Chips Too. Omg, I still can't figure out how bad this thing was. The plot was a Joke .... The plot was not existent .. and the camera work was to be done by a 3 year old child. I have never seen a movie so long to go nowhere. I think the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes. I suppose this guy had some extra time on his hands .... (Like 3 hours.) And an extra 60 bucks in his wallet and decided one night ... (Hi .. Let's make the stupid movie ever made. ) And they just did it. Give me a break. I'm on my way back to the video store right now to get my money back. Anyone who has seen this piece of waste must do the same.
