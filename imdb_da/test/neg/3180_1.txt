I am shocked and amazed to find reviews that are short for miserable for this horrible movie. I rented this "movie" or stool, whatever you want to call it, with more friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop seeing. Just listening to the dialogue left a terrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. This movie was about as intelligent as a bird of prey. I hope I never see the good-less, raggedy Anne-like again (Julianne Nicholson) again. It was like seeing the most boring pilot for a sitcom that will never make it to television, but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes (all I could just do) it was an eerie 90 minutes.
