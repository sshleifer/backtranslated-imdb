Pluses: Mary Boland is gratifying on the edge as always (I never tolerate her overcrowding zaniness, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). TOILET. The field's short role is fun, although the famous pool table scene is a little welcome because it seems to be running for ten minutes. Madcap antics of the movie, typical of the period, are great. Also a nod to Alison Skipworth's wonderfully grounded hotel mistress; I would love to see more of her (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another personality that is great for praise). <br /> <br /> Minuses: Gracie Allen. An irritating, involuntary presence whose irritation was unsurpassed until the advent of Adam Sandler. The near-falsetto nasality with an accent of unknown origin grows old in its very first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen movies I've seen, and while I (as a great classic comedy puff) is trying to experience at least one movie with all the great comedy stars, it's definitely a team I don't want to call again. Her timing and interpretation of the material is completely gone. A maddeningly mediocre talent. Bottom line: An OK comedy, but gags are few and far between. And in just an hour you can expect this to be an A-grade Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who would like to see all their work.
