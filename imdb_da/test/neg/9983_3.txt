210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or I hear) or the R-rated version released to theaters? Both are terribly awful, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both argued that they would have never made this movie (the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!), And I can see why. Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot. <br /> <br /> Not much of anything here except cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the movie: "It was like a moment I wanted to stare, admire my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians going on it." <br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br/> <br /> 1/5 stars.
