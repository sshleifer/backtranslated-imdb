Well, I agree with the critics about this, who all said "leave it alone". Why they had to do this reconstruction of the 1960 "Psycho" I do not know. My guess is that they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern actors were the answer, as they were the most important changes. The dialogue was the same and the story the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I'm delighted to not overdo it with a lot of beauty and nudity and make it a fun movie. But if they were to keep everything the same, why disturb when you didn't want to improve on Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? <br /> <br /> Did they honestly think Vince Vaughn should be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Ann Heche, with her short male haircut, gets better than Leigh? I do not think! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were pretty much in here, but it's the black-and-white photograph that helped make the 1960 version scary at first. It's perfect for the story, not a bunch of green and pinks! Once again I think the filmmakers knocked on an audience that never saw the original. <br /> <br /> This was just a stupid project that should never have been out of the ground.
