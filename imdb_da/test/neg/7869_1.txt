Dear Movie Director: <br /> <br /> In the future, it will be best to get your hero * Run * instead of jogging / shuffling when trying to create a sense of urgency. Especially if you are trying to strengthen a timeline. For example, if you try to convince the public that the bad guy really wants to kill the hero if the hero does not find her, then it is a good idea to convey a feeling that your hero believes it can actually happen ... Let us see it though. Of course, making a * good * movie was not your goal. Your goal was to pump some waste that will make more money than it costs. Otherwise you may have hired some actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bored Viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I can't say it's the worst ever because I was able to finish it. It was bad, bad, bad. Dude, where's my refund?
