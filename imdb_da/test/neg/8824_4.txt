It looks like an exciting perspective, a modern dress "Othello" with Christopher Eccleston, which was so scary good in "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jude" and Eamonn Walker who brought such intensity and introspection to its central role on "Oz." One would believe both of them natural Shakespeare, but both performers misfire: Walker's Othello is a pretty cookie cutter take on the part, with a whisper delivery that doesn't have much influence; And Eccleston blames it terribly as Iago, flashing on the camera in almost a scandalous parody of the role. It is likely that he became the egg of his director, whose florid approach might have worked better with the Elizabethan language, but which seems a striking, pretentious choice for this modernized manuscript. And the play itself is less disappointing to be fashionable than it is to be obvious? It is as if Andrew Davies outlined the famous plot and then just wrote what was first the dialogue in the head. All in all, a mistake. 4 out of 10
