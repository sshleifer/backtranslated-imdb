Heart of Darkness was terrible. The novel was hard enough to understand, but when a production company decides to release a movie loosely based on it, it just crushes everyone. Not only did those responsible decide to change some characters and completely eliminate others, but the play was terrible, and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete dud. I watched the movie in the hope of understanding the novel a little better, but it threw me and my colleagues off completely. I think the movie was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing movie, especially when he has great flicks like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs under his belt. Same with the very cool John Malkovich.
