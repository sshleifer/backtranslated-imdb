You need to recognize Cimino's cinema contribution. He gave us both the most overrated film in the story (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with 'It's bad, but not the worst ever,' let me explain. <br /> <br /> For 20+ years, I listened to the critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate" - in fact, it was not difficult because you were barely bombarded with opportunities to watch this movie. So a few days after watching 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate' movie, I stumbled on a spent $ 9.99 DVD in the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to find the most negative review ever written about this movie (you'll find a wide selection) and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she does everything she can to put one positive slope on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of ​​how big a mess Cimino has done. <br /> <br /> While pretty much everything is wrong with this movie, what ultimately tracks the scale to make it worse ever (and a classic 'less' than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association sent a group of regulators / gunmen to Johnson County and had a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired weapons who had come to Johnson County to clean "rustlers". The village's citizens then besieged the regulatory authorities that were finally arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women did not participate actively in the matches and apart from Ray and Champion there was minimal loss. After all, these were not assaults - and there were no carts of immigrants who drove around circles around the law camp (early Westerns on the contrary, it was a movie-making unit and not an Indian's actual tactic). And weeks before the regulators' arrival, a number of residents of Johnson County were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, the goalkeeper of a modest ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (who resurrects Cimino as his two leaders, and he even shows Averell alive to a mature age) . <br /> <br /> There is no film-making sin that is greater than fictitious story if you want to play fast and lost with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who can walk away a movie that believed what they actually did. Fortunately, so few people saw this movie that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it's hard to blame Cimino for its distortion of history. He could probably escape anyway with an insane defense - the movie provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of the sky gate, it would explain many things. But my voice goes to "lack of talent management" instead of insanity. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually look at the screen where some of the big budget went; expensive set-beautiful epic camera shot-artificial dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) provides a comfortable and comfortable performance, although most of her scenes are extremely boring (it tends to happen when the instructor forgets to give the viewer some reason to worry about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if it is quite common. <br /> <br /> But do not fall for the bush that this film is experimenting with narration by blending carefully crafted moments of character interaction with structured, burst explosions of common action. This implies that there was a method of Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence, Cimino storyboarded a single scene or attempted any control or organization. It seems that he just turned his DP loose to the stage and to get an infinite selection of colorful shots - 1.5 million feet of loosely set scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pair this and fit everything into the after-production. <br /> <br /> The final battle scene is really fun as babushka carries the townwomen (perhaps borrowed from a "Fiddler On The Roof" touring company) throwing countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately, each explosive falls just outside the target and explodes harmlessly. When you see this happen 50-60 times, you can relate to the woman (the one that resembles something of 'Wrathens grapes') that puts a big gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Ciminos mother did after writing that review. <br /> <br /> Think about what you've heard about this movie since 1980. It's a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Only of value as a "non-cinematic" example for film historians and as a source of entertainment for those who are aware of American history.
