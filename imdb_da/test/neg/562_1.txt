The man with Bogart's Face puts it himself to remind viewers' nostalgia for the late 40s at the end of the 40s. It fails for several reasons. First, Sacchi lacks while he looks reasonable like Bogart and even speaks like him on an occasion and uses his way, without Bogart's charisma or ability. This is really evident when Sacchi does not clearly mimic a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second, the film does not have the first character characters Bogart was able to work with. There is no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet in this one. Sure we are treated with performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, but they are just not of the same caliber (or do not get enough screen time or fail). Thirdly, the attempts at "modern" humor go through. All the underwear jokes that have Marlowe almost * never * remove the regular hat and trench coat (though Bogart would have) etc. Just isn't fun and really pulls down this movie. Fourth, I have never heard a goofy theme song this side of Mitchell. Finally, the film's false reverence for Bogart (and other classical actors' work) is really annoying. Bogart almost * never * played a straight hero, on these occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This movie makes Bogart a trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. Although this may have been the case with some movie characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit for a ticket. It's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past, think everything is hokey, "good guy beats the bad and gets the girl" crap with low production values.
