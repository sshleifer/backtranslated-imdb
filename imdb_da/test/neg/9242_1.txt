I saw this movie and all I can say is this ... I'm not a film student, nor am I an artistic intellect trying to look for a deeper meaning in everything I don't understand. But if I were to do that with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yep! He's on drugs and I can see it now ... he talked one night and sat with his friends laughing and saying things like, hi ... wouldn't it be fun if nuns really could fly? Like what if you just dropped out of a plane and disengaged for a while, jumped to the ground and got up and walked away? * tiles * or if buckwheat gave the Pope a bath? Oh my god, I'm jumping up, just thinking about it! Guy! We're gonna make a movie about it! And then he says to his friend when he laughs ... Oh, and wouldn't it be fun if people loved it and called me a genius for it? So for me this is what happens when a guy does too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie. Should I have made LSD to understand what this guy was thinking, could I also have a little laugh? Because I'm gonna tell you, I didn't laugh. I go and control the time. I think everyone who tries their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I had never heard of this director before I came to read reviews that I did because I was angry that I lost the last 2 hours or how long it was (it felt like 12 hours in my life) and I can I never got it back anyway ... I've read that this guy is a heroine user and he would die for art ?? what dunk is that? So my point is kind of proven. This guy is not everyone there, he is a drug addict and his movie is proof of that ... So please end by trying to find a deeper meaning for it. If you really want to understand everything in this movie, drop some LSD and sit back and relax so it can actually make sense. It reminded me of the time I saw Gus Van Sants last days, another movie I was sad to see. I can't do without, but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie if the same people went through the reviewer. It seems that if the film's director is completely out of his rocker, or if it is a French movie with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, it will get good reviews, hands down, everything else is boring and has already been done. BLAH, take it out boring!
