Miserable. Talk about botched. NOTE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every respect. The salvages Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to pull the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaking tug. They are challenged by ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang of machine guns starting. This part sequel, part remake, has Caine, Malden and another group of Poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. Among this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely you want to be blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a trolley aboard the Caine's tug. <br /> <br /> Catastrophe Irwin Allen not only produced this but also decided to correct it.
