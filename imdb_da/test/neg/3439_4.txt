You get an hour and a half of brain death, I have to save the world action all the way, a liners and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a guy who helps people in the witness protection program. to quote the film's cover. He deletes their past to save their future. Woppi, it must be cool :) I bet younger people will like it, but it's a little over the top for my taste. And the one liners are really something else, and I don't think so in a good way. After killing a crocodile, he manages to say. "you are luggage" If you are in the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. And as far as brain interventions are concerned, it's not that much. But almost before the movie starts, you know exactly what should happen. But if you like these kind of movies, you'll probably enjoy it. I rate this movie 4
