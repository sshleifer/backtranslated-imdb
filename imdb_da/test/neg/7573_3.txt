This movie has serious doubts as to whether Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His BLIND DEAD movie is praised by many fans. I can understand this. But you will be a Gothic vampire trite like MALENKA not showing any signs from a gifted movie maker. And this also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. It contains horrible plays, a stupid plot, stupid events, many other things you can expect from a bad monster movie and also veteran actor Ray Milland doing his best to mumble through this movie while he doesn't have much of a clue about what he is doing in it. Apparently Milland was already very ill while he shot SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last theatrical move) and went out with a ridiculous stink like this, making it even more boring. A final appearance along with Peter Cushing in a television movie made by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much about it. <br /> <br /> But the sock pad / sea hose is a hoot to see. See it whirling up a lighthouse and crush it. See it destroying a harbor with miniature boats. Look at the breaking down bridges and munching on charming mini trains. <br /> <br /> Good badness? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
