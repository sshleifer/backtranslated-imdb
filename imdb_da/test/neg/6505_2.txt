Okay, so this was made back in 1993. Led loose by Robert Iscove and written loosely by John Miglis, it should be based on a true story. Hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. Surely it was clear from the beginning that this lady, after all, she could get. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson looks a little older than I remember him, playing the empty-headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat boring and empty life. Now it came to him as Tracy Pollan, a little girl with kinky sex as her means to conquer her. <br /> <br /> Come on, call sex, even in the 90s was old hat. Can't believe anyone would fall for the old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him plenty. <br /> <br /> The hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the lady out of his apartment and put all his junk in the hallway (the INFO PAGE OF HIS APARTMENT) and then the stupidity didn't change the locks. That was when I had enough of this trite movie. It made me wish that the lady had tried it on me so I could have the pleasure of telling her to take a trip. <br /> <br /> I give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. It was so bad I thought it was. I guess you can't blame the actors. But they were terrible. Have they actually tried to play this with a straight face?
