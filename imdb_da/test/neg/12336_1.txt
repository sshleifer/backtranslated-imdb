We'll see who the good guys are. Association. And who the bad are, a rich man who steals elections and his pampered son. The filmmaker forces us to look good from evil. All the characters hate the evil guys, so when we see the movie it can help us to hate the bad guys. This is the worst kind of filmmaking - manipulative and childish. The reason is centered on a policeman who is between the good and the bad, and he is stuck in this ugly movie. It is boring and meaningless. The story of the star Keach is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, surrendered to the hilt, plays the guy no one likes, and who we should not like. It takes a long time for this drilling to take off and for the title to assert itself; Then it goes down, it collides a moment later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
