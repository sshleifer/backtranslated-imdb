The first 10 minutes of the movie make it fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. It's the two reasons that the movie is so bad. They always refer to a movie called "Get Leo", which is the movie-in-movie version of few shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta is not very cool, neither is Keitel. But The Rock and Vince Vaughn are fun. They are not the kind of fun you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie itself. If you haven't seen shorty, you'll probably be cool. If you liked to be shorty, you will leave the theater wishing to kill the director and scriptwriter. Wait for the DVD.
