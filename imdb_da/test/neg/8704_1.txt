I as a Christian is furious after seeing only the first half of this picture. The film's website says they studied the film before they wrote, but I think they forgot to hear the ultimate source of the Bible. I sat with two different versions of the Bible and couldn't find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was as if they had made what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible to what they thought modern film-watchers would see instead of truth. I'm personally too young to remember 1950's ten commandments, but it can't be worse than this. I have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty.
