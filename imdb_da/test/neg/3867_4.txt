Well ... there were some beautiful, cream-smooth facials of Marlene, along with her "shocking" sex legs outfit (plus her non-to-be-missed "transmogrification" from monkey to man); But in general, it's generally convincing plot and dated play - not to mention the less than engaging melodies that come from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice - a bit to ensure Blonde Venus a permanent place in my mind Pantheon of Memorable Films. Cary Grant - still in the cinematic childhood threat - seemed to be always "finding himself," while Herbert Marshall was probably never anything but Herbert Marshall from the day he was born until the day he died. Of course, from a historical point of view, Blond Venus was fun to watch as long as one could put aside ... "great expectations".
