From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet walks by reading through a field at dawn and thus invoking all the clich√©s, the cinema has evolved to counter the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character of the period drama - I knew I was in favor something to make me kill myself. Joe Wright not only read the book, but under the regrettable misconception that what he filmed was not actually Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners through sparkling, delicate social interaction in the 18th century English room, but some sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus, we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy, which took place without any apparent reason, in inappropriate robust nature and often in slope rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and especially P&P, is not about passion, sexual excitement or love. These are different strategies for negotiating stultification of eighteenth century society. It was completely ignored, so the Bennet's house was a rambunctious, chaotic place, all shouting at once, running around, leaving their underwear on chairs, and pigs walking happily through the house; community balls become rowdy country dances a step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance orgy; And everyone says exactly what they mean without the slightest consideration of decency. Jane Austen's genius lies in exploring the void created by a society where no one says what they think or believe because of an overwhelming propriety view, and the tragic preachers of her characters derive from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by the speechless divide. So both the luster of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - especially in this movie - to work, were completely erased. Subtleism in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favor of an overwhelmed drama that only hit the material and performance. It was so natural to try to be a * serious * movie. The humor - which is Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost completely suppressed in favor of all this po-faced melodrama, and when allowed in, was handled so clumsy. Pride & Prejudice is a serious story that makes serious points, yes, but the serious points and weighty themes are not just intertwined with humor, they are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bones of history and expect themes to remain. Not even when replacing her techniques with your own powerful mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett should be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and lucid. Keira Knightley played the first half of the movie as an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half as an empty-haired schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elisabeth's joke, her huge exchanges, her characteristic characteristics of being able to see and laugh at everyone's bad feelings, including her own, her strength and calm, and her amazing visibility were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring in the distance? Instead of being able to hold her head when everything about her was lost, she began to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not at all; no, these were shiny hissy suits. And where Australian Elizabeth's great strength (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to maintain integrity and compliance while remaining within the boundaries of society and maintaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no meaning whatsoever for the convention. In addition, she seemed to think about walking around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century edition of overalls putting her beyond doubt as spiritual and strong and therefore nothing in the character as written or performance had to maintain it. An amazingly unobtrusive and bland performance. In what quest for slackness and weakness, she was closely compared to Matthew Macfayden. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffective and permanently befuddled without the evil sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of man's relationship that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because they were both fooled into a world of fools, and it completely deprived the film of the end of emotional consequences. Sir. Bingley was no longer gracious and well-meaning for stupidity, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laugh, and the woman who played Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she did not even try to do anything with the character at all. The manuscript ran wildly between the verbal pieces of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkably clumsy - and at the same time language that would not be out of place in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself heartache.
