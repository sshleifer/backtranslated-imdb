I'd like to put 0.5, but unfortunately I can't. Who can write such bad scripts (I watched the movie five seconds and knew that the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - had to pay his taxes when you see how good he was in Redford's movie, "Ordinary People" and others!). Although I don't like it, but I had no choice, I saw the film in French, but I know hearing the right voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would not have changed things, except perhaps to make it more miserable. What makes me sick is that people serve their bad things (I forgot to talk about Mr Waterson, far away from Woody Allen's movie, which he once used to record). <br /> <br /> We had another movie on another French channel: a silly James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about the real bonds with Connery (thanks, it's the end of the holiday, wake up!) .
