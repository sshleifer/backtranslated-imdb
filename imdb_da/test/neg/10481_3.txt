Rivalry between brothers leads to the main story. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far you can get into the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards) seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up to Y12. Of course, Dan has a problem taking orders and is also convinced to venture the devil. <br /> <br /> On Dan's second flight, he hits the 300s in the comfort zone, and his craft passes through a meteor dust. Back to Earth, Dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of bad asphalt. He also has a demanding desire for blood, whether from livestock or fellow human beings. <br /> <br /> Short time in an hour and seventeen minutes; black and white with near stoic acting ... typical for low budget sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Rounding off the cast is Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Remarkable trivia: approx. two months after this movie was released; Russians put the right first man in the room.
