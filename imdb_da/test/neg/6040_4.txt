WEBS is a pretty strange movie, though easy to see. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who sucks into a parallel overrun of mutant spiders or something. The film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited locations and the slightly boring manuscript that manages to do very little with quite an interesting performance. Basically a 90 minute episode of the TV show "Sliders" and no more. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review and review of other movies in the genre
