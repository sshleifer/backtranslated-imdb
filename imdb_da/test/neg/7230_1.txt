Oh wow, the sign shares my name first name! Nick! This movie is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, there is at least an actual squid in this movie. An actual squid that gives a better look in this movie. By better I mean, "longer" action is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through. Just to tell you when this ninety minute movie ends, you are not only free from your sofa, but you get your ability to breathe back. Not only that, but you realize how stupid you are and then commit suicide, and realize how terrible life is when you see this movie. Really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more screaming as this is being realized, and where in hell have the real masters of horror been lately? This movie should have been the last straw so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in the horror movie that could make some actually good modern horror movies, this movie bites.
