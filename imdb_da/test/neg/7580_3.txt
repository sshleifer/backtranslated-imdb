I decided to watch this movie because it has been listed as the "scariest movie ever" so that was what I expected. Unfortunately, what I found out is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment in it (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The movie was nothing but awful clich√©s, and each time there was a leap moment, it was incredibly clear. The benefits of this movie would be the music and the odd scene that actually shot well (as the very first scene when she opens the door, and you see Tune in the reflection, and when it returns to him, you see the ghost on your shoulders). Overall, this film did not add anything new to the J-Horror genre, and everything lacked creativity and scare.
