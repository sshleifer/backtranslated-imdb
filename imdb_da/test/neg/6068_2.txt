For a movie I really looked forward to, I was very disappointed. I had no expectation that this was another Amadeus, but expected a more significant depiction of Beethoven's last year. Ed Harris's performance was amazing, but the story was so weak that the movie simply moved from one boring scene to the next without continuity. The only pleasant part of the movie for me was the 9-day performance, and from that point on I could quite happily go out without finishing. <br /> <br /> I left feeling very unhappy and still have a feeling that something important was missing.
