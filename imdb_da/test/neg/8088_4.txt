If you want to see someone accidentally eating another man's testicle or looking at a number of pathetically fake hairstylists at a wedding or listening to a man, talk about how well it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, so is That movie for you. Alternatively, in neck-breaking fashion, between romantic and brutal comedies, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays wife of Horatio Sanz (tell me another), found in many silhouette situations with other women, but there is surprisingly no nudity. Jake Busey is thoroughly disgusting as a dog dog that you do not want as your friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good and make a compelling couple, but the movie is too busy and trying to disgust to be good.
