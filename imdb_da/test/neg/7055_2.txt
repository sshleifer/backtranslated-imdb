The movie's title makes it sound like a porn, but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, Hot Summer in Barefoot County is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners. However, the moonshine comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. Almost everyone can guess what happens next but strangely, the film is very tame. Nor does it qualify for a PG rating. Moreover, the low budget is obvious in almost every shot and the actor is sooo amateurish. This film was probably intended for the recovery, but it is unlikely to meet them even in 1974.
