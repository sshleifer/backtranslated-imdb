He finds the story of a man's love of an innocent baby with a deformed face and on the opposite side of the world there is a low self-centered "girl" who shares a date of birth with her and ends up making a big difference in both living. What a great and worthy storyline. But in this telling screen writing and / or management and / or editing is as poor as taking most of the joy out of the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mother to wicked witch and back faster than a speed ball and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, drop of hat. Katie (The California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's Mom and all, including the bad lady at the airport check-in counter, Lin's adopted father, the best, most ruthless man alive and his wife and biological son, all in constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a heartbreaking story, but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hates and battles were over. There were too many unexplained or illogical events, many of which do not add to the story. My wife and I kept looking at each other and asked ourselves how such a good caste and what was going to be a great story could be caught so badly.
