This is by far the most boring movie I've ever seen! And if you don't believe me, go ahead and see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the story doesn't make any sense at all. People struggling makes no sense. I couldn't understand what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases I haven't even bothered). It doesn't matter to keep you watching the movie. The only plus would be cinematography. New Zealand looks great. Everything else is simply sucking. The actors do their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you go to bed instead. <br /> <br /> Do us all a favor, even if this comes on "On Demand", don't see it!
