I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide range of movies, and I mainly go for his horror movies, as miserable as they are at times. I think it was morbid curiosity that drew me to this and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it. Maybe it got better towards the end, but unless you are in lesbian sex scenes (of which there are plenty) you might be able to take a passport. So what can you say about a movie that has a woman sitting in a bowl on the kitchen table (while standing up)? Just remember what is used for later, you probably won't know. If that sounds exciting to you, then this is your problem, but then again you just like this movie. I myself am not a prude, I have seen lots of obnoxious movies in my day, but at least they were well done, and it is not. Sometimes too much is just too much. Bleah.
