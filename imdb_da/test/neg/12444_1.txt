Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obvious from people who either had a stake in the movie or had friends / family who had a stake in the movie and that was okay - if I had made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there to compliment it too. In honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. Good: The overall plot was mildly interesting. The music was generally pretty good. In fact, several of the songs (when you could hear them) were pretty cool. The only musical issues I had were: # 1) the first excitement scene with some kind of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to get away from the excitement), # 2) the song was played when the protagonists went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and # 3) were the songs that were good, too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song played in the background while Danny Trejo hung a man (sounded like a beautiful, cool song, but it should have torn the scene when Danny Trejo got froggy). Now for the very bad things: Scripture was horrible. I mean, HORRIBLE. I've seen a smoother dialogue in a Star Wars movie. Advice to the author of a part-time writer and a full-time film buffer: When writing dialogue, ask yourself, "Is that something people would really say?" Honestly, the script was ridiculous. I want to slam the action, but with that kind of writing it is hard to know if they have talent or not. The mildly interesting plot was severely hampered by the crazy dialogue. I know it was low budget, but words do not cost money - if you have a good script, even semi-competent players can pull it out. This movie also didn't seem to have, but hopefully the director will get another shot to make a better movie.
