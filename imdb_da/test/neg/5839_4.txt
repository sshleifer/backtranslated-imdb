I'm not sorry to find "redeeming social value." No matter what books or filmmakers want to suppress, from the heart of Huck Finn / Darkness, I don't know, Deep Throat or the latest daycare, I sincerely wish they would not. I am not a lover of porn or violence-like entertainment, but what I have the chance of, I tend to see camera angles, inserts, pans, lighting, rhythms, almost the fear of fear or titillation, sometimes even missing filmmakers or the intentions of the actors. Even from recordings that reasonable people must argue for should never have existed, I always think that there is something to learn. I wonder more about how a movie does than what it does. Maybe it's wrong of me. Wiser, but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema can be to see cuts, pans, etc. In one piece and inseparable from any content. I ask myself which horror film makers and church architects have in common. Add in political filmmakers, fascist and not. Everyone manipulates with light, space and sound to change perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it for almost a year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I sampled a few minutes of "1" the day it arrived, up to the awkwardly sound-treated street corner that really did attack the film consultant's sensitivity, found it unfortunate but effective. I would have to come back to it, for sure, but not enjoy the view. It was obviously not the sublime horror of Cairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the Raver, but still traditionally framed horror of the first evil dead trap, the obvious political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant crudity of early Cronenberg. br /> <br /> Maybe the word "attack" is the key. Matsumura does not attack his characters, but his viewers. I can't see these at this time in history without thinking of both Abu Garib (some of which I think I remember being shown on video) and the hostage's videos, but also of Godard's torturers (in Le Petit soldier?) To whom cruelty is just a job, a fraction of a person's working day. And then there is the long-lasting Northern California news story whose details I can hardly forget, but can't completely forget because it also causes "cinema", a duo of serial killers infamous whose suggestions don't play games with my memory because they have video recorded itself torture victims. <br /> <br /> All three ANL records are revenge films, vigilant exercises, but I attach these notes to ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and can be a turning point for Director Matsumura. (I haven't seen the records that came with ANL3.) Through the first two deals, I imagined a camera fell into the hands of one of these fringe children from middle or grammar school obsessively drawing war scenes or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura's avenged characters had become a writer-director. Anyone who looks at those who haven't seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see it.) But ANL3 seems to strive for mainstream. Matsumura's protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typical Japanese cool close-ups of nature scenes. There is also, for the first time, a Matsumura movie, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him as he looks at the hotel customers of love. Kikou unhappy finds the sandwich between. He is an intermediary voyeur. The short tension comes from the layers of voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur that somehow makes me think of the poem that is repeated in Wakamatsu's non-in-all-what-it-sounds like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. <br /> <br /> I'm not coming down with this and it gets in the way of commenting on other movies. Cannot escape the fact that for some years I will be entering a Matsumura retrospective on my local film archive, perhaps hosted by some learned characters trapped on something I am missing. How much does it matter whether the director is or just "gets" his killed confused main characters? Should he even understand them? Maybe the director's job is just to spit it out, so let critics, sociologists and the rest of us have things out. Perhaps direct or artistic responsibility is a false concept. My final struggle with this thing made me wonder what a woman thinks on earth, sees these overwhelming male exercises. We put women through this over and over again, from Star Wars to et cetera and et cetera and on and on and on, but is something just as male-like as All Night Longs?
