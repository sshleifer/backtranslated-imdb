Jerk hazer Mike (David Zelina plays this college frat man like a big bastard you want to die right away) and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow, a legendary ghost story. They get PO'd at Sam, who is essentially in shock and seeking a swinging blow on Mike, landing over his girlfriend Patty (Kristina Sheldon) instead of letting the poor guy hang his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul comes "forth" with the lively scarecrow coming from the cross to destroy anyone who left the poor guy there to rot. Mike and the gang return the uninitiated dorks to bring Sam down, but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their necks. Mike and his pose lead to the beach to forget about alcohol, play volleyball and bicker until scarecrows finish their little soir√©e. Sam's replacement brother Jack (Matthew Linhardt) has to look for him, but decides to sleep with new love-interest Beth (Samantha Aisling) instead. So when he receives a cell phone message from Mike about how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were out at the beach taking in the sun and sand, Jack is afraid of fear. Beth's alien father is a doctor, and he agrees to look for Sam's condition after they have cut the nearest dead young man down to him in the emergency hospital. Back to the beach to confront Mike because of his negligence (not to mention Jack's promise to train Ramsey, played by the UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, for not hazing), Jack and Beth will face the same straw stuffed assassin the others. Coach Ramsey, who was part of an earlier emergency event that went wrong with causing fatal bird-scare, has to confront some demons themselves as he informs the group's survivors of what they are against. <br /> <br /> Babes, boobs and blood..this flick follows the basic slasher guidelines. Nevertheless, this flick also carries the typical slasher features of corny characters, plays, dialogue and overall plot. The ticket shows signs that it is low budget, especially in violence, as most of the real action takes place outside the screen rather than showing what is happening, close and personal. What appears on the screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer's revenge: a guy with his gut, another with a stick (stops on the group's volleyball net) killed through the chest, blood spot after a woman is hit over the head presumably with a big rock , a chick put dead after scarecrow hit her with the SUV, etc. There are also some duplication problems, where clear, the sound of their voices often does not match the movements of their lips. Especially the unintentional hilarious sequence in which Ed (Travis Parker), Wannabe Rock Star, sings to his friends an awful song, they all seem quite impressed.
