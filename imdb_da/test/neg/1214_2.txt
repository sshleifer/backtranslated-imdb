Brooke Shields - in deviation from her sudden Susan duties - play a bitter divorce involving three girlfriends in a "girls alone" weekend in Palm Springs. The problem: Brooke is "unattached" and on prowl while her friends are all involved. Therefore, the title implications and the emotional backlash cause their "amorous" weekend. Despite a couple of laughs generated by Dan Cortese ("Victoria's Closet") and MTV "Relationship Authorities" Adam Corolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky, these are just stupid things for women. D. B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito co-star.
