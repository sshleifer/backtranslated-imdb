I went to watch this movie over Matchstick Men, actually buy tickets for Matchstick Men and go to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, excitement, jungles and exotic places. They had all that, but then many movies make a perception of the story. All I can say is why WHY, why not just make it a real story instead of some juicy flashback story. <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies from what I've seen the movie originate from: Of course, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, Tom 80's Old-fashioned Tom Selleck, Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (from the use of digital extras). PS The only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.
