In short, this film is a statement of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is easily the most important European film producer from the 80s and 90s. No other living director has shaped the style and content of the current European cinema more than him. It is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two noisy movies, but rather a complete and total disaster, confirming that he has run out of ideas, humor and, worst of all, empathy for the characters he creates. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. All Almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. This time it is actually quite easy if you are familiar with his previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", only this time the director is straight and the jealous whistle lover is a millionaire. For those of you who are not familiar with the movie, I make a summary. If you don't want to know too much, skip this section. A blind man who used to be a famous film director seduces a sexy panty woman who reads a paper to him after a chance for street society (yes, that's how it starts). Then he will be visited by his agent and best friend. He mentions her that he has learned from the paper that a particular millionaire is dead, taking the story back 14 years. He still sees and is leading his next movie. He stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the management when he is immediately merged with her. The Millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his homosexual son, as he has been synchronized by an interpreter (some amazing scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent disgrace, the mistress escapes with the director of a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire who produced the film had released it in the worst possible editing, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but have an accident where the instructor is blind and the worst actress dies. Back in the present, he learns that his agent has preserved the film's negatives and begins to reconstruct it. <br /> <br /> As in "Poor Education" there are different sub-areas to steal this rather thin story and, as in "poor education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. For example, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, has an unfortunate overdose of the drug - which is completely unnecessary for the plot and also interpreted poorly. <br /> <br /> But for the most part, the actors are not to blame, but the way their characters are written. Blanca Portilla as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. Lluis Homar is an old man's dream of a protagonist living in an artificial world where an English alias and a few sweet words can seduce any supermodel. And Penelope Cruz is the performance of this old man's sexual fantasy. Her character is completely lifeless. It remains thoroughly incomprehensible why she would go from an old man who at least helped her family to a slightly less old man who is not charming enough to convince as either a romantic hero or a passion assurance. <br /> But all these shortcomings would not make this movie so horrible. Almodovar, however, makes the worst possible thing of a director (or any kind of storyteller) without ideas: he quotes himself, something he has done increasingly and to very little advantage. The movie-inside movie, which "Broken Embraces" uses as a plot driver, is actually "Women at the Border of a Nervous Breakdown" (1988), only this time called "Chicks and Suitcases". This pretty imaginative title can give you a hint of how this beloved classic is dealt with here: while the dialogue that makes up the last ten minutes of "Broken Embraces" is a shady over-top exchange of screwball lines in the original movie, here It is a stern, colorless, annoying business community. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this DOA brainchild of an exhausted creator of past tales is rather awful and disappointing as the last Indiana Jones feature. Perhaps not so many people would agree with that because Almodovar used to be such a genius. I'd rather offer my respect for his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to see "Everything about my mother" or "Get up" or "High heels" or "Matador", all of which testify to Almodarov's unique and unmatched talent. A few more movies like this, and his legacy may well be destroyed for good.
