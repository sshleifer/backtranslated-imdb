If you come to this movie to learn about depression, forget about it: You will not learn anything except how you do not write a play on the subject. I understand the intention was to show how severe depression can make an average person a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature ... no little feat. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth uses the whole this movie to scream at the top of her lungs, maliciously offends anyone, bursts into tears or a combination of the three (the only exceptions are quiet at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest hint of what she can be like without depression ... not the weakest mica of other aspects of her personality ... she just screams. At one point, her roommate tells her, "Lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around when you're not getting depressed," and my reaction was "She's?" It seems strange that the authors would include this comment without giving us any examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no clear structure or flow at all; Instead, it consists of a series of spooky tense scenes by Lizzie, who screams, then ends. Character development? No ... Scenes of her everyday life, ie. Going to classes, may it be important details? No ... Scratch at maximum volume? CHECK. It's not quite enough, I'm afraid. 10.1.
