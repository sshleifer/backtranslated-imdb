I have never seen the first Killjoy movie, nor have I ever heard a good thing about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon boast it. Now the massive Troma fan, I'm there, no way I don't want to rent this movie out, how can it be bad with these two in it? Oh, how wrong was I? Even Trent and Debbie can't save this excuse that a movie is as bad as it really is. Trent frankly stinks like Killjoy, although it is more to blame for the authors who give him some of the worst one-liners in the film's history. Debbie puts in a solid performance, but that's not enough. The killings are terrible, just as they do. For example, check out when the guy is allegedly forged on something or something. And just to top it all, the end is just one of the worst I've ever seen in film history. The film does not even work so badly, it is a good level. Avoid the flap. <br /> <br /> 2/10
