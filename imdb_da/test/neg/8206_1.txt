If it was possible to give negative stars, I would for this stink burger. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good crappy movie. I'm a big fan of movies like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. The B-cinema's real classics. <br /> <br /> But this movie actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an academic winner !! Dialouge is so unnecessarily long lasting and most unsatisfactorily used. (ie "I want Condensed (yes, condensing !!) for your wishes. The action could have been much better if they had some more logical lines. <br /> <br /> The story? What story does A count are confused because his wife had leprosy? I'm still not sure of that count. One (Rich?) Fleet one and Captian of one of his ships crashing on the island? People who seem unnatural? OK, I like camp ib - movies a lot of it's charm, but it was just stupid .. Plain dumb A salt sea Captian that sounds as well-versed as a university professor? A fleet owner who is as wise as they come (I felt this the guy had no idea how to play it, a scene he speaks Spanish, the next English / European)? The counter, who is not sure if he is a reincarnation or really DeSade (don't ask me how DeSade is in this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and i still could not figure it out. <br /> <br /> It s I could show this turkey to my little grandchildren and worry only about those who sleep through it. I like a mass of the early 60's horror movies, and some still have good shocks, but this thing ... never had a shock or even a hint of a scare. The information on the back says, "This movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare." The only breakdown is watching this movie. It's 90 minutes. (The case says it's 74 min.) In your life, you're not coming back. <br /> <br /> I paid only one buck, yes one buck, for this and another movie. I still feel like I owe .50 cents for myself to sit though this. To sum up, the Dungeon of Harrow had no one named Harrow in it, but it had a lovely cardboard dungeon.
