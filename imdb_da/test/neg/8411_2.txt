Sam O'Steen, the movie editor of the 1968 superlative excitement tab "Rosemary's Baby", leads a fast-paced television sequel where Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is shunted off early - and inexplicably - probably helping by eradicating the more ghoulish aspects of this relaxed story of Satan's son on Earth. Most interesting is Ruth Gordon's return to his Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland cast as her husband, Roman), but she does not get much to do - and looks terribly unpleasant at being involved anyway. This script is purely low-cost and must have shamed the original author Ira Levin (who continued to write his own successor). Quite dim and pallid, with poor photography and no tension or scary at all.
