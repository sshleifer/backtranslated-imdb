Necessary things were one of my favorite Stephen King books. But this movie is one of the worst books for movie adaptations I've ever seen, they have changed so many things around that it made me sick. Even the concept of the book is deception, things not always what they look at reminder the whole book was not shown in the movie. Althogh was fun, as many Stephen King movies are, but so many Stephen King movies, this one did not follow the book and became a piece of Hollywood trailer trash. 2.10
