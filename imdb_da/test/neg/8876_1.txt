This movie is just another waste of time. The reason is ridiculous, forced the US drama. The characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who was only okay in his classic interpretation when he served as a French ally. <br /> <br /> Just another chance of losing money in a good movie. I think it was not a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Perhaps the instructors should think a little about the film's meaning or not before wasting the money. Maybe they don't break because they have profits before they are launched in the cinema. <br /> <br /> No more hope in the cinema ...
