Nothing I don't like more than a kung-fu movie that plays for laughs. That's the main reason I can't stand Jackie Chan (or his look-alike). He was not always a clown I must add. "My young aunt" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. It is a perfect example of how the subgenerals were brought down to the mud by endless stupid antics and childish behavior. Unless you are 5 years old, I really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of movie fun. But humor is actually a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this type of approach had permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. I thought leading lady Kara Hui was very good here. But I had such a hard time sitting through this that I couldn't enjoy her fine performance. If you don't mind all silliness, you like it. I know I didn't.
