First, I am amazed to see that this movie has been rated 7 on this site. In the beginning I thought it might be industrial people who log in to IMDb and jacking up the assessment. But after looking at rat tomatoes and since this movie has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that perhaps people have just been duped again to fail pretentious crap for depth. I mean, this movie is simply horrible. The action is simply horrible, but the rest of the movie is worse. at least the action gives some (unintentional) grin. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a teenage skateboarding boy who is questioned by his friends for a murder that happened to a park where they are skating. And it's about it. The rest of the movie consists of the aforementioned horrible plays, terrible dialogue, slow motion shots of people, people's faces, people skating, often set to music that doesn't fit the scene. Perhaps it was made to be "cool" or experimental or hip. Or maybe it was done in the hope that it would fool people into believing it was somehow deep, but it didn't work. nothing in this movie works. It is pretentious waste. I can't recommend it enough.
