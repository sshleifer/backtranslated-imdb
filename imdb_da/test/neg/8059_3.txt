CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ beyond 5 stars) Lousy excuse for a movie ... which you might like if you really like boring, nonsense jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence. A couple of drug traffickers fleeing from the mob travel to the jungles of Paraguay to seek emeralds and cocaine. They meet with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks, one of whom is an anthropologist trying to prove finally that cannibalism has not and never existed. One of the two dealers turns out to be a little psychopath, and he tortures and kills a few natives to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels. (And how could they even tell him when he didn't seem to speak their language in the first place?) Now, the natives are suddenly not too enthusiastic with white people in their jungle and catching them all for some reverent torture. Bad action, bad plot and poor direction. Not a decent moment with excitement at all dull 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not very convincing (though a few shots will still get the most viewers). The only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendering of the "Red River Valley". The following is a quote from the movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if many viewers didn't say exactly the same thing at that point: "Oh God, let her die soon. Oh, let her die soon. And let me die too soon , thanks. "
