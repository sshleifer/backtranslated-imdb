This show is just another bad comedy that is likely to be canceled after two seasons. It is not just that the jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, nor are they fun and clichés. In the first episode, the father said something like "I don't want women to go out and get work and have the same rights as men blah blah". It really helps attitudes? Then he made fun of his son and said he was strange. Which parent says their child is strange? So generally this is boring, unoriginal, offencive, clichéd and most of all not FUNNY. Yes American Dad's offencive. But it also makes you laugh and of course takes the micky. That's the difference.
