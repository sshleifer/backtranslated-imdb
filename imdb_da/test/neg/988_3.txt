Being a history buff, I rented this movie because of the subject. The idea of ​​the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on a small group is exciting. Unfortunately, the film becomes flat. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing happens much for long stretches. The director uses goofy images (offered in the form of daydreaming sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the ice slab, but instead goes along with authentic looks and movies. The signs are also poorly drawn. In the end, we don't care much about them as we should. It's a pity that it wasn't what it could have been. I still want to see a good movie about the American immigration experience, but one is not.
