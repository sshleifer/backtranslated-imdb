These are times like these, I really wish I was a more eager reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, as very few things feel worse than not fully understanding a movie of this amazing 'visual' caliber. Based on the novella "Cabal", the story of "Nightbreed" involves a behemotical amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground community of demonic ghouls. A normal guy becomes attached to the strange world, called Midian, through his dreams, and his psychiatrist directs him to believe he is responsible for a number of horrific murders of families in recent months. Thinking this to be true, he goes back to Midian - placed under a rural cemetery - where he reluctantly accepted. However, the shrinkage is just on Homeboy's cure with a devilish scheme to whip out the community of Nightbreeds ... <br /> Wanting to love this movie so much, I was very disappointed in the long run. Unfortunately, I have not read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and purpose and all these monsters were terribly confusing, and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand how the final rock was cut to hell and even the Barker show's moderate aversion to the overall product, but I just didn't "get it". Although reading history is crucial, I feel that at least it must be translated into movies in a way that is still understandable to those who are not familiar with the literature. If "Cabal" is as intricate as this movie than Barker really milked a dead concept. Couldn't help feeling a bit bored after a while, especially when things started to become increasingly ridiculous (somewhere around the prison scene, I understood how boring I was) - like a police officer who would fearlessly go to war with Midian as it happens every week! No one seems to think that the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I liked the visual effects and all the crazy ship going on in Midian, especially the four-man lady and the great leader SOB ... Absolutely an epic flick when considering the massive amount of effects and the convincing morbid decor. David Cronenberg fills his position well as the luney shrink with his cool zipper-head potato sack mask, but we all wish he had done some back-the-camera work to help save this pile ... <br /> <br /> So if you have a boner for Clive Barker material and fully understand what exactly Midian is, why do they show creatures under the opening title sequence (horrible idea!), and why those creatures are staying there and how some punk kid shares one Telekinetic link to it, you should probably check "Nightbreed". I will look for "Cabal" one of these days and hopefully get some perspective ... Or maybe I just want to forget this travesty completely ... Until then, this is a poorly constructed and pretty boring mess in a movie ... Instead, see "Hellraiser".
