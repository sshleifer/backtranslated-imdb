This was the penultimate film appearance of Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made a few waves in the press as she dropped her then David McCallum in 1967, beginning his long relationship with Charles Bronson. It's a big irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in the number of deaths performed on the screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. The 'murder' seems to be a movie that was saved in the canon's production plan for Bronson's and Ireland's sake. Ireland is already suffering from cancer-related illnesses in 1987, and you can almost see the two actors wishing to do 'just one more of ancient times'. "Assassination" is carelessly done as a whole and shows the lack of Polish and dwindling means that could be thought of by Cannon in 1990. But there is a kind of nostalgic value by seeing the couple together one last time and the film casts doubt on what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a senior Secret Service Agent dedicated to protecting First Lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The president's wife has a reputation for being difficult, bossing Service agents around and wanting to do things her own way. However, it changes when trying her life, and she has to travel with Killian by car, train, motorcycle and believe it or not, dune buggy to escape would be assassin. There is a little surprise here when Killian thinks the killers are part of an inside job, perhaps arranged by the president himself. Along the way, Killian and Mrs Craig develop an unspoken love for each other in scenes between Bronson and Ireland, which are actually very fun. What really gets me is how this movie was promoted at the release and how it's still made to look like a DVD The original trailer gives you the feeling that "Assassination" is another cold-hearted Bronson shoot-em-up. But much of this movie - which was rated PG-13 - by the way is in a comical vein that aligns it with a romantic thriller like Bronson and Ireland's Western 'From Noon To Three'. Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow up. As he does, but to a lesser extent than his other 80's potboilers. <br /> <br /> On the whole, 'Assassination' is late Cannon slop work and doesn't really know what kind of movie it will be. Besides drifting from action to romantic thriller and back again, there are serious errors in continuity, property values ​​are bottom-of-the-barrel cheap, and the effects are terrible; Many of the explosions work like food work instead of being done on the spot. Robert Ragland, who had shown good skills in previous films, teamed up with Valentine McCallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better suited to television. <br /> <br /> Richard Sale's script has a true lulus dialogue with talks between Bronson and Ireland is the only bright place. There is no explanation why the first lady is called 'One Momma' suddenly, nor why Ireland is back with his British accent when the character is a Wyoming native. Jan Gan Boyd, who plays Killian's main assistant, has a kitten-like personality and badly mistaken as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (a former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as assassin Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this was the last film-recording recording for Peter Hunt, who broke on stage with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' in 1969 and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin on 'Death Hunt' in 1981. The 'murder' is available on DVD via MGM Home Entertainment; It is presented in double widescreen and standard format with three language subtitles and theater trailer. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4
