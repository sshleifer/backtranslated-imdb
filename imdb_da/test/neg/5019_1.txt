This movie is amazing. The only way a girl would do this action on a dog is if she had serious mental health problems or had a long history of sexual abuse or was being forced. Yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise "normal" healthy female just got a bit bored and "made a little mistake" and we had a sexual encounter with a dog. It has never had any harmful influence on her again, except when she tells someone. <br /> <br /> She wasn't raped by a dog, or the dog did something she couldn't resist - she started active oral sex and completed this activity with a dog of his choice. She wasn't on drugs or anything she just felt like that. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie seeks to put this action in the face of 'hi it could happen to anyone she's only honest'. <br /> <br /> But for this to be believed, we have to believe that this is a woman who is able to do absolutely anything if she just feels like it. Think about it - could she have considered the rights and disadvantages of this action before it is executed? If she had, she would have stopped in her tracks. People have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we now have to start considering bestiality as a "sweet" little aberration, what's next? Child Abuse? Yet, "heroine" is portrayed as a hard work by, a pretty girl who had a moment of aberration. If she had been forced to do this action by an abuser - history could have given more meaning and I would have accepted the story. But there is no way that anyone performs the extended activity required and referred to even once - if there is no deep disturbance that requires a lot of psychiatric help. It's no way that once happens in an otherwise perfect life. I know this is just a movie, but through the normalization of behavior like this via the media, society is being desensitized and more and more terrible realities become possible. <br /> <br /> I could imagine an abuser pointing this out to a child to convince them that it is not so much and then proceeding with their agenda. It can also be used by an addict to emphasize a child not to tell about the abuse - because see how people will react to you if you do. <br /> <br /> It's not about the truth. The director wants people to think it's about the truth. It's about degradation and how easy people (viewers) can be manipulated to accept the most horrible concepts if they are packaged in the right way. It sees the public being manipulated, broken down, and laughed. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where the actors and viewers are humiliated and fooled in a very sophisticated manner by a smart but highly disturbed movie writer. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to me to be used as a vehicle for the movie maker to get out of the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner. I do not know if it is conscious of their side - but it is the most classic example of Mind F *** k that I have ever encountered. I hope this does not offend anyone too much. But if you saw this movie - I don't think there's room left to be offended by anything more.
