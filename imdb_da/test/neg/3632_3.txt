First, I want to remove a common misconception: It's not unrealistic that Zoey's school goes on, giving students laptops. At my school, they must have Apple Macbooks in class 7 and above (this is paid for in the entry fee). Move on. This show is very annoying. It has boring, predictable plot and bad acting. Often in the show, it brings "girl power" to a new high, with girls firing guys in everything they try. But that's not the worst. The worst thing is that girls are still portrayed as focused on their personal appearances and screams when they are happy. Apart from the one wise girl portrayed as a freak obsessed with ugly boys and science. But this show is very addictive. I don't know why, but it is. Although the recent season has been so horrible, bringing stereotypes, boring plots and bad plays to extremes I never thought was reached, so I'm no longer dependent, fortunately.
