As a true movie, I love having to advise you to avoid this terrible effort, God knows how funding was approved. Seriously, it's a movie experience that delivers zero dramatic excitement and plods until nothing happens over and over again, the only connectivity options are two scares that at least keep you awake. Possiby the worst movie I have ever witnessed, and the play of the female leader is the limit of criminal intent. A blessing with modern technology, you can fast forward and watch it at 12x, and it will only last 25 minutes, "And you won't miss any of the plot <br /> <br /> No idea how people find it interesting at all and some give it high marks!
