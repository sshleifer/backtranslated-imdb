I worked on this cruelty ten years ago. Luckily for me, nobody knows because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was happy! My agents were driven by (apparently first time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their events with the agencies as often. They told me later that one time back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours of weather entertainment! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it is at least twice as long as it should be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - what a waste of movies!
