Let me first start by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It is unfortunate that IMDb does not have a tenth of a star ... I saw this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night because of insomnia, and that was absolute garbage. The reason was horrible. The action was horrible. The movie was completely boring. "malachi" looked like the shadow with alec baldwin (the shadow is infinitely better than this too) the signs eve were so undeveloped and 2-dimensional she didn't even grab my attention. I didn't even know she was called Eve. Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut. "TWIST" (if you can call it that) was ridiculous and pathetic. When that had happened, the film had done such a horrible job of building excitement or attachment to any sign that I simply thought "Who gives a S ***." The only thing that made me raise an eyebrow about this movie was the fact that with. teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (Also a film that was light years ahead of this movie picture massacre.) Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless peoples' time. It is no wonder that no actor from this movie has ever had a fruitful career. In summary .... This movie is so bad I feel dirty and need a bath. Worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (remake) was better and dare I say it Saw IV was better ...........
