Remnants of an overloaded army unit connect a group of cowboys to battle their way through Indians on the warpath. It sounds like it could be an exciting western one, but this one is boring, boring and boring. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are uninspired, the actor is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography is not very good. Eastwood plays in a very early role an ex-Confederate who does not like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. It's about the only extremely interesting situation in the whole movie, but Eastwood was not seen by an actor to pull it off, and his character crosses as frightening rather than angry or bitter. A very ordinary western. In fact, a lot less than ordinary western. Worth to see if you are a drowsy Eastwood fan and want to see him at the start of his career. Otherwise, don't bother.
