Because Disney more often than not ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their successors, it was actually a wonderful surprise. I don't know why Disney doesn't pay more attention to their successors. The graphics quality is always inferior to any background worthy of the name Disney, inane plots and worse dialogue with little or no attention to the current story, and the cartoons are almost always worse than Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality. <br /> <br /> The quality of animation is still poor compared to Disney originals, and the dialogue is pretty tired, the story and the overall performance were really entertaining. <br /> <br /> Although not so captivating, it doesn't quite succeed in capturing the charm and / or mystery of the first. There is some hint of it, hidden away here and there. <br /> <br /> The kids will at least like it. <br /> <br /> It bets a 4.5 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
