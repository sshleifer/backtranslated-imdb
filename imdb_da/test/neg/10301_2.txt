I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and also worked at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston during Allison. First, hospital shots are unfortunately suburban. Texas Medical Center has a daytime population density similar to Wall Street !! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest children's hospital before it was doubled in size, twice! Methodist, with his 1500 beds, is one of the world's largest hospitals. The Texas Medical Center skyline is bigger than Memphis. Still, the best images Hollywood could muster can be for some stupid hospitals in the middle of heaven (besides the right image of the hospital several decades ago). They also combined several real characters and depicted them all in one (super-nurse). In fact, I know the medical technology (s) working in the bloodstream. Two where actually work at that time, but the movie shows only one pregnant MT. There was a pregnant MT and another MT who took the precious patient antibody rolodex (research "alloantibodies" for more info). I will not mention their names (privacy). There was no nurse in the real life laboratory. Hollywood combined these two techs (probably saving time and money). In the film, military helicopters (true) had to transfer our babies (NICU and PICU) to UTMB all the way to Galveston! Why can you ask when we have the largest children's hospital right down the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read right, they refused !!! Being employed by them I was ashamed. Needless to say, I am no longer affiliated with this facility. Any other comments will be repeated to those who have already been submitted by the people who actually live here or have lived through the experience.
