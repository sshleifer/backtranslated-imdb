I think it's safe to say that if you only see standard store in regular offices or premium production, you shouldn't bother with this movie because you want to hate it. If you are an overly critical movie buff don't bother either. If you love science fiction movies and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future then you will be mildly entertained. It is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low, but what they have done with the money is worth the pat on the back. Some of the burning scenes were pretty bad, and the evacuation scenes were awful, but it is clear that they had a good support from a computer perspective, as the planes and the alien images were quite inventive. The dialogue is down right hilarious, but does not act quite poorly. As for the story well, I'm not quite sure what actually happened to tell you the truth.
