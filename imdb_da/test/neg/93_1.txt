I totally enjoy The Wrecking Crew (1999), the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999), which I haven't seen yet). I know it was baaaaad, but the three managers did a pretty decent job, all taken into account. <br /> <br /> However, this was really terrible. The Ice-T was terrible and he is the producer! Can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learned to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones did quite well in her little role, although she later went on doing some terrible racist "jokes" on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other times unfortunately). Way to go, girl ... No one else comes out with any credit. Strangely, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are much better at The Wrecking Crew, which was made with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How it works, I don't know. <br /> <br /> I'll try the Ice-T comment now to see if he's apologizing for the movie or trying to make us believe it's a good piece of film making.
