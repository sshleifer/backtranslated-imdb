I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was terrible then. Now that I'm older, I found it just as terrible. Universal could have done better than this. They just decided to make the most money they could spend using all their monsters at once. For me it was a cheap shot. These characters were able to keep their own in their own films, and the choice of actors was regrettable. Dracula was supposed to be Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein's monster was needed to be Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my mind, it was Disney's crooked sequel sequence done many years ago and it wasn't appreciated. Umiversal started with something big and original, and then they thought they could pander to the masses with the schlocken, which is extremely evident in this film.
