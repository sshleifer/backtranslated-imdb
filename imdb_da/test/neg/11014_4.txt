This is another of the movies I remember when I was a kid, and I recently managed to get it from ebay - 20 years on, it's not as good as I remember it. <br /> <br /> The story is "vaguely" started by a cosmic event (there is another extra filmmate in the "weak history development" credits), making collective ants become super intelligent. Ants who used to wander with each other have ceased rivalry and are now working together. What I wanted to know was to do exactly what? You never find out what they want. Nigel Davenport and his sidekick travel to the desert, where bizarre anti-activity has been noted, and begin studying the ants from an impregnable igloo-shaped laboratory. Probably the most chilling scene was, in my opinion, when the two scientists visit the giant peat in the crops (as a square version of a crop circle) a result of the ants crumbling away. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't very scary simply because you don't know if you should fear the ants or like them. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can continue with their laces - but you won't find out if they're really evil. It is not a sci-fi, because the "cosmic event" explanation is too vague to be duly taken into account. It is deffo more of a cooler. TBH flares, bold hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenport's unnaturally large facial hair - freaked me out more than the ants! Have you noticed that there are only six players listed in the credits? Yup, the right one - SIX, and you won't even see other people in this movie. Not even in the distance! This is a clearly clear low budget film, which is a bit of a concern because you probably haven't seen one like it. Anyway, I can't think of anything. The film of the ants is pretty good, they must have made months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to hold onto the movie. You might say to yourself how hell do they get the ants to do it? over and over, but it is quite simple. You will also notice that the filmmakers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the movie too, so animal rights peeps STAY AWAY! Good for news, but you can't see it more than once.
