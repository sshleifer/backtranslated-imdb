It's not plot driven, OK; it is not a drawing studio fine; there is no action, okay; it's nothing, hmmm ... Maybe it's supposed to be boredom and the absurdity of living in palistine and parts of Israel these days in a state of violence, disagreements, deep root aesthetics, etc. But mostly is it long, long scenes of nothing happening - or things that seem to drink with meaning (a control point tower crashing to the ground, an Arafat balloon flowing into Jerusalem, a curly tiger woman converting bullets into a halo) But when you try to make some sense, there is no one there. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie fast and it makes no difference unless it can be a little less boring.
