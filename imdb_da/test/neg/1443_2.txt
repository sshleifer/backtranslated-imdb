Incredible. Great cast, fair acting, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this movie has such graphical atrocities that are not tense or tense, just plain disruptive unruhe. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see the freak returning to its habits. And that Robert Englund acted (was he?) Like an idiot; does your daughter forbid sleeping with a soccer player, but he tries to kill an idiot and likes kiddypr√∏n is okay? <br /> <br /> Police who are daughter were kidnapped - someone thought he was a policeman and not an actor? Not me. This film draws again and again with a conclusion that we see in other horror films: if the returns were okay, part 2 could be made. Bad, really bad things. Can give creeps some inspiration ...
