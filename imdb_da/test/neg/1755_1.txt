What gives Anthony Minghella the right to destroy two extraordinary works of fiction ?? First, he ruined the English patient who was bad enough, but now I discover he's slaughtered Cold Mountain - slaughtered !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to the English patient. My son and I went to see the first weekend it was released and I was so disappointed but told my son I felt I needed to read the book. I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what the world critics were talking about when they said Minghella had trusted enough in the cinematic public's intelligence to give them a good movie. That's what he most probably didn't do. <br /> <br /> I don't usually read a lot of fiction, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I didn't see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it played in theaters, and that was because of what Minghella had done for the English patient. But as a fool I rented it today, and I'm so sorry I had to awaken my frustration and most of all my sadness that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on display, and now they will never. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND MAKE THE MOVIE ROCK ON THE SHELF. I will never be taken by a Minghella project again. I think he can be one of the worst directors working today and I'm tired of the praising Hollywood heaps on his head. It must be that no one in Hollywood reads more. This movie has no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego must know no boundaries, and if he didn't like the book, why didn't he write an original manuscript and leave the book alone. Although I hadn't read the book, I would still consider this movie one of the worst I've seen from 2003; And I've seen almost everything that has been released for viewing in the United States. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you wouldn't like this either.
