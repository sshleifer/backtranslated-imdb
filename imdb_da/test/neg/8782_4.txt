The indeterminate origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became Ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad - reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for the 1980s audience. Right off the bat even though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop getting anywhere like Lone Ranger. It led to a scary little fight that made headlines. I know of people who refused to watch the movie because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired it awesomely uttered Klinton Spilsbury to play Ranger. Spilsbury was very beautiful and muscular, but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act. In fact, his entire vocal performance was reintroduced by another actor! Also, his off screen antics (public intoxication and hitting people) didn't help. Action aside, the script is boring and slow. Also the Ranger itself didn't appear until an hour in! There were some complaints at the time the movie was too violent for a PG. But I don't think it was that bad. <br /> <br /> There are a few (very few) things done right here - the photography was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is very funny as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally turns out (with William Tell Overture booming from the soundtrack), it really is praise. But all in all, this is a dull and terrible attempt to bring Lone Ranger back. It's easy to see why this bombarded. A 4 - mainly for photography.
