So we all saw the same movie ??? I can't believe in the ravens, some of the others give this truly awful bio as belief or not was approved by Shirley Temple itself, based on her book CHILD STAR. Gives me the feeling that some are very easy to please. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, regardless of her modest talents is by no means, shape or form, also looks like Shirley Temple enough to be cast as her in this kind of straightforward biography of the world's most famous child star . She gives no indication of why or how this child was so reverent except trying her hardest to make a Shirley imitation that never clicks at any level. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> And that's the big handicap in the whole piece. But as if that is not bad enough, any drama associated with Shirley's story of her climb to almost the night of star humor has been completely whitewashed with incomplete writing, quizzed with occasional song and dance moments that are not even approximate what Shirley did (like "The Codfish Ball" with Buddy Ebsen, which was probably the highlight of Shirley's choreographed dance routines). Just putting a girl in a polka dot dress doesn't make her Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's own brand of charm, warmth and appeal is even suggested at a distance. All we see on the screen is a pale imitation of the original evidence that once there was only one Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> Writing something more about this mess is worthless. None of the others are more than ordinary in lifeless roles. My advice to Shirley's fans is to read her book - or even better - see her movie. <br /> <br /> These are pits.
