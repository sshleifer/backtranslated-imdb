I did it through half of this but wasn't enough of a masochist to see everything. The first half of the movie had almost no dialogue! Almost everything was voice over comment to bear the story. The screenwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennia of detailed history in the voice over. At the same time, he forgot to do any character development. Most science fiction fans do not require large amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the spacecraft ended up fighting each other. <br /> <br /> There are some good things going on in the movie. The sound track was well done. Some of the computer-generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
