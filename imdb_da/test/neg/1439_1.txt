Oh, where the hell should I start? Give a brief summary of the story? No, you have already heard or will not. Whatever it sucks. Much like the movie. I happen to be a semi-big horror movie aficionado, and I have to say that this is one of the stupidest and most clumsy movies I've ever had the displeasure to see. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story starts too fast with absolutely no excitement or structure at least. All of these torture scenes would have been much more effective if we even gave the slightest shed for the signs. Since the first scene in the movie is when the teenage girls meet Capt. Howdy, how in hell should we sympathize with them? First, they seem stupid to party with a guy they don't even know, and secondly, we don't even know their marvelous names! Why the hell should I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they actually have the courage to try to make us feel sympathetic to Capt. Howdy, after being "reformed"? PLEASE! I cheered when he got his just deserts! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved worse! We also have to sit through a meaningless misdirect sequence lifted directly from the "Lamb's Silence" (and here it is done HORRIBLY! Of course he will give them a false address! would wait and not pierce any guy Johns on top? RETARDED!) <br /> <br /> There is the dialogue. Everything Captain Howdy says is either ridiculous or just stupid. "The dead are so terribly dead when they are dead" ?? What the hell is that? Dee Snider at some point says "knowledge is power". Well, if that's true, this movie has absolutely no power. <br /> <br /> There are plot holes. Yes, I know it's a horror movie (well, wannabe horror movie), but the hell! You could drive a truck in those holes! First, these must be the DUMBEST police I've ever seen! EVER!! I mean, dear God, these guys are morons! Call for backup, idiots! Second, how the hell did the humming septum ring out of Captain Howdy's nose? Quite openly, this piercing expert says "it's the biggest I've ever seen", but if it's so hostile, how in hell could it have fallen so easily? Have Capt. Howdy just left it on the crime scene because he wanted to get caught? They certainly did not make it seem like he did. Also, they would never trigger Capt. Howdy, and I know for a terrible fact. He would be in prison for the rest of his life and there is no one to come around this. Much less let him return to his old house where he killed / tortured everyone. POSSIBLE AND IMPLICABLE. <br /> <br /> And now the actor. Dear God, sucked these people. Linda Cardellini is the only good thing in this movie. She is clear and wonderful. Too bad she hardly gets a good chance of trading in this piece of shit. Amy Smart shows up in approx. 10 minutes and then fall out of existence. Even the normally entertaining Robert Englund is underutilized and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy guy with no talent at all. I never felt threatened, scared or scared. I'd rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette's role in the "Bride of Chucky". It would have been so much more fun to see this talent-less hack get it from the lovable psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is simply naughty. He can't act (he's one of the least scary villains I've ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?), And of course he's stupid than freaking Jessica Simpson! This movie is just one way for Dee Snider to show all the strange bushes he knows about self-abuse and modern primitives and blah-blah-blah. Either it has been done before, or it just didn't have to be done. I was bored through the whole horrible thing. <br /> <br /> The action sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacifier sucks, the special FX sucks, the director sucks ... basically sucks this movie. This movie is trying to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror flick and unfortunately it fails. It fails to scare, shock or disturb in any form, manner or form. This is probably one of the least effective and completely non-original films I've ever seen in my entire life. A piece of cinematic waste caught on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at all costs. Not comfortable at least.
