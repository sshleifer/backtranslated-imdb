I'm not really sure where to start. From start to finish, bad, smelly bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to see this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how flicks this bad makes it past the cutting space without the entire wheel ending on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without cowboys. I've seen better animation in the original section of Blob. You will get more entertainment from watching Gone with the Wind while suffering from puke and poops. Bad plays and hokey lines will make you squirming and wishing you had rented Peewee's Big Top or saw all the episodes of Gilligan's Island back to back. UGH .. I wanna go wear my wrist now.
