SLOOOOOOOW, lukewarm, poorly produced 70's schlocker made moore cowvincing because of today's headlines; Nevertheless, this movie is worthy of stinking because of uncowvincing acting, absent-mindedness and stupid 70s clothing (unfortunately, MooCow remembers when Adidas clothing was all rage ...). This has the same form that some better 70s sci-fi moovies accowmplished, namely "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run". Although the premise is interesting (rich people clone to keep a clear supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), making the film a mistake by saddle us with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone that is immediately both boring and annoying. Hollow acting by Donnelly does not help but fits right in with the rest of the casting. Even such B-lights as Dick Sargent ("Bewitched" TV series, "Ghost with 1,000,000 eyes), Keenan Wynn (" Dr. Strangelove "," The Dark "," Laserblast ") and Peter Graves (" Begin of The End "," Killers from Space "," The Conquered World ") gives only the most insidious performances, produced, directed and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it is not surprising that" Clonus "does not apprehend anyone at least much less be aware of someone! The truth is told, there is nothing in the weak flick that even schlock fans would love - if you want to see some really bad, funny 70 movies, put on something by Greydon Clark. "Clonus" is no one bonus, MooCow says even the MST3K version is a gilter, so proceed at your own risk !: = 8P
