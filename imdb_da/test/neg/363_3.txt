Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster, so humanity now survives underground divided into different religious cultures. What caused the disaster? I have no idea ? Why is humanity divided into various church faculties? I have no idea . Since the Earth's surface can no longer support human life, how can humans grow crops to feed the population? I have no idea . What kind of manufacturer thought this screen deserved to receive funding? I have no idea <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of those movies that creeps up late at night on cable channels. The kind of movie where you consult IMBb to see if it has any benefits. The number of people who have commented on SHEPHERD on this site has not yet reached two figures and this is a film released nine years ago. Maybe those people who have never seen it are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> As with the rest of the plot, it is very routine. Grumpy former politician Boris Dakota, whose wife and child died several years earlier, meets a woman and her child and it is up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Throw a former wrestler who is now running God's channel, a fascist Christian blocker who tries to stumble on Boris, a ventriloquist, some T&A for that reason, and you have a mess in a movie. I think after seeing this Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY, it might be a movie theater work in comparison
