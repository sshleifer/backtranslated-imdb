Rented 3 bad movies to see with my friends in my dorm room. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. I picked up Jack and Lep 4 because they have the well-known bad movie I've never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie because it matched the guide "How to find a bad movie" on badmovies.org, No real description, no pictures of the movie on the back, and I had never heard of it, should be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so terrible it doesn't matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a really bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are stupid for the purpose, it is stupid despite the best efforts of cast and crew. This "movie" starts much like Evil Dead, even the actors are similar and have the same dress form. Unlike evil dead, it never achieves any speed at all. For a "slasher" movie, it is pretty bland, for 80 minutes 6 people are killed, but they are scattered so far it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The director threw many boring pictures on animal hunting, of course, to go along with the entire "Prey" theme, but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring. Gore is terrible. All of these extra shots were a lack of a script and a story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion, another way to add length to this. "Climax" is such a total joke, it's hard to laugh at it so badly. The back of the box says "The ending will shock and haunt you." Yes it will, it will shock you that someone could put such a bad "plot twist" on film and "haunt" you because you don't believe you paid to see this crap. <br /> <br /> Also the tagline is "it's not human and it has an ax!" A person is killed with an ax throughout the film and it is off. <br /> <br /> A real one out of 10. I love to laugh at bad movies, but one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities. No bad filming competes without a real cartoon girl: P
