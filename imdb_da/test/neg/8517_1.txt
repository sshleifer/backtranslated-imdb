I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it now makes a comeback at the local movie club. It uses all the clich√©s in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (Beginners Edition) to become as intellectual as the instructor is likely to be. You get your slow-motion pace, brown color scale, slowly blowing through bombed surroundings, shiny, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic images and the necessary miserable end. <br /> <br /> It's a complete mistake, an unintentionally perfect caricature of the typical Russian art film. The director, Aleksandr Sokurov, has excellent engineering strength, but he lacks sight. He does not see when he crosses the line into the pathetic kingdom. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wet dream for art film hats. It meets all stereotypical views of the genre that is there. <br /> <br /> If it was bad in an entertaining way, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you go out afterwards royally at ed-off, we need a new concept. This movie is a Sokurov.
