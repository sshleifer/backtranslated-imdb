I'm a fan of bad horror movies from the 1950s and 60s - the movies are so ridiculous and stupid that they're good at laughing. So because of this it is natural that I would choose this movie - especially because with John Agar in it it was almost guaranteed to be bad. Unfortunately, it was a bad movie, while it was the worst kind of bad movie - boring outside and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad movies, you can laugh at the horrible monsters and horrible direction and acting. Here you never see so much of the monster (mostly because of the darkness of the print) and the play, but badly, is more low energy badly ... listless and boring. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with some young adults going to the satan's cave to the neck. Well, given the name of the place, it is not surprising when later found chewed! Duh ... don't go in the neck of Satan's Hollow !! Now there are reports of a kind of broken object from heaven, so what does the teenager do? Yep, run a dance party - a very, very, very slow dance party, where the children almost dance in slow motion. So it is up to the Sheriff (Agar) and his men to ensure that teens can dance in peace without fear of masturbation. <br /> <br /> As for the monster, it is a guy in a gorilla suit with a stupid mask - a little like a monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high technology. To make matters worse, it makes noisy sounds and moves very, very slowly - so slowly that even the most corpulent teen could easily get out of it! How to kill repeatedly is beyond me. <br /> <br /> All in all, too boring to suffer - even if you are a fan of miserable cinema.
