I've never seen the first three, but I know they're all better than this ... rubbish bin. It's about a child throwing a party. Wow. Sounds great (sarcasm). Is it? NOOO! It starts with a child in bed and he is woken by his mother. So, the child pretends to be ill so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and rounds some people and throws a party. I didn't laugh at all while I saw this bin. I can't imagine anyone sitting down writing this dialogue thinking. "Man, dis! @ # $ Is gunna be great, you!" Make me wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I saw this by knowing that it would be bad, but usually seeing a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. This just disgusted me. Twice down!
