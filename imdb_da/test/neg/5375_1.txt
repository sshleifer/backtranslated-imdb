I agree with the other two remarks. I waited over a month to see this great new show A & E had been hyping. What a disappointment !!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. His voice-overs are campy, not scary. It sounds like he's talking in a can. From the second episode, which is about 30 minutes or so (if you take off the advertisements), he is being chased or followed by something he knows is demonic. He can't say the name whenever anyone needs to convey the name they write it on a piece of paper and deliver it to someone else. Not very informative or entertaining or trustworthy for the rest of us. Why can't he say the name? ... supposedly it would give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought demons would hide their true identities. Knowing the exact name of the demon does not make it easier for you to throw them out. Now, the next episode that flies little by little is the title "exorcism". So, Ryan already needs an exorcism? Not to say it couldn't happen, but the show so far has not provided any evidence or evidence. I can tell Ryan that if I was a kid, hell, if I was an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to chase something that scared me, I would look elsewhere for help !!! Besides which, if you do not use holy water and blessings etc. in the right way, are you no longer at risk of worrying what is already sour on you? I will see tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time I see it!
