I admit it now. This is one of the loudest movies ever made. But in Mr Sjogren's defense, "not really" the scene was not that bad! <br /> <br /> And you must love the effort to go all the way to Sweden just to find a cute Swedish 15-year-old blonde, get her to speak Swedish as the Jewish mother of Henry (dennis hopper). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henry's father responds to the blonde Swedish-language (Jewish?) girl in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actor / actress of everyone in the movie must be the nun who takes care of Henry's mother, it is a woman who has no experience in acting, but still makes the most compelling performance for everyone! <br /> <br /> All and all this flick is nostalgia for me personally, after all, that's what gave me a posting on IMDb's database. : D <br /> <br /> // Feelin as a movie star *
