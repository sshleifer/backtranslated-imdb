This film was a bleak attempt to recreate a crucial time in English history. The movie version of Cromwell's growing commitment to the war is marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was far away. This film meant that the war was started over religious differences, but the civil war was by no means Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill, nor did he "save the day". The kings did not win, the match ended in a draw. As another reviewer noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "Five Members" to be removed from Parliament and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried the WAY too hard, and it didn't turn out so big. <br /> <br /> could have been better.
