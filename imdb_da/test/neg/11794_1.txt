I just saw this movie with a couple of friends, they said I had to see it, but from the beginning I knew it would go from bad to worse. So I can only give this movie a 1, because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that everyone can see that there were no "real" ghosts. I feel the worst part was this so-called "old haunted house" contained a whole lot of new items and a few "cozy placed items". I could have thought up-effects that would have looked much better than a chair was turned over by an invisible ghost (or should I say lead). So later, when they see the tape on the chair, it is reversed in a different way. Uh Oh, it's a big continuity error. If this was a really good movie, they would have caught it and all the other "old houses" things. This movie is like a rip off house on the haunted hill and the Blair witch project rolled into a poorly thought out and unified movie. I would be ashamed to put something out of the bad for the effects, effects and cheap video of the play, and how convenient the camera is when something "paranormal" happens. This movie is an insult to people out there who are actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost movies on tap.
