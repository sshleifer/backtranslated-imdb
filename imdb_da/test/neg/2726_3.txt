"The Vindicator" is a strange little Canadian B movie. At first glance, it seems to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "Terminator" knockoff, but strangely, it also shares some qualities with the original "RoboCop" that had not even been released yet, as "Vindicator" appeared (1986). Coincidence? Who knows? Still, the story is like this: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a great looking guy working for a super duper secret state-of-the-art research laboratory reporting to a sleazy boss named Whyte, who heads up project funding early in film. Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the road, which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "lab accident". But wait! Carl is not really dead dead! Whyte has brought Carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project, a kind of experimental biomechanical space suit. When Carl wakes up in his new body, he understandably walks a little nuts, drops the laboratory and escapes. This is a problem because Whyte (for only known reasons) has programmed the mechanical suit with a "Rage Reaction" program that will cause Carl to kill someone who touches him for some reason. Gradually, the little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. So Robo-Carl walks effortlessly through the movie for a while and kills a few random muggers and other different background characters until he returns to his home and contacts his wife (this scene must be heartbreaking touching, but it turns out comical because Carls Robust voice is so heavily synthesized that one can hardly understand a word he says. Of course, he tells her to leave town and never come back because she's in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Eventually, Whyte hires a command line led by "Hunter", an apparently ninja assassin played by Pam Grier (!) To hunt and destroy his ongoing creation by using Carl's wife as bait and predictable (but ridiculously cheap-looking) chaos. <br /> <br /> I'm a B-Movie kind of guy, but "The Vindicator" was so half-assed that it turned into high comedy pretty fast. I suppose a good budget bid went into Stan Winston's robo-Carl costume design because it actually looks pretty cool, but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap, made-to-TV look. The script could have used a lot more work, but maybe the filmmakers had the wind of "RoboCop" in production and rushed to get "Vindicator" out so they couldn't accuse them of tearing them away. Whatever is judged by the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one who has noticed the parallels between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop", and of course "Robo" is the superior movie so you don't waste your time sitting through this nonsense, unless you want to see a movie that can best be described, at best as a rough draft of "RoboCop" if it was made of an 8th degree.
