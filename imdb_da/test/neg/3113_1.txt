I had to read I know why the Caged Birds are singing in my English class and we watched the movie after completion. After watching the movie, I'm sorry to see. It completely removed some of the effects the book had. The scenes had no meaning in their sequences, the play was terrible, and it happened that the screenwriter never actually retrieved the book, but chose instead the clip's notes. I was upset about how the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut out, and some aspects were extremely important to Maya's growth as a person. If you've read ... Caged Birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book so I warn you not to see it.
