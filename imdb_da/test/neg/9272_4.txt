History of a former Navy Seal, which is now a control doctor assigned to a state-of-the-art Russian part with a nurse. This is to answer a call to help held by a dying member of the original crew. The underworld has been overtaken by terrorists bent on destruction. So we see the duo trying to get control back. And that happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is releasing everything it has got on the terrorist section to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Beware of the early explicit sexual scene in the film's first quarter. A couple of inexplicable scenes towards the end. Look at it when you have the time. Nothing to miss, even if you let the show run while you go, you get a cup of coffee: slowly moving.
