I happened to see a promo for this movie on the Spike channel last night, it was grouped with a Patrick swazy rerun of another movie he made and thought there was hard in this sequel ..... boy was I am wrong .... I see the screen writer also star in it and I think the budget was a little tight. I'm surprised to see Will Patton in the movie, he has far better credits for his name to play in a "c" movie like this. Bussey Jr. tried so hard to portray the image of his father (one of the best bad actors ever) who failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie were chicks ,,,,, great and with lots of T&A just not worth it time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
