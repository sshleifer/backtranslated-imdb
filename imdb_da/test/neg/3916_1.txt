Oh God! ohdear! ohdear! ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... is ... 'movie' just puts room flicks to shame. Every sci movie I've seen over the past year has been disappointing to some extent and I'm now serious about reconsidering which genre of movies I actually like in the future !! (Maybe I'll see romance flicks from now on!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And that doesn't say much!) <br /> <br /> This flick is so cumbersome stupid, it battles Battlefield Earth and Baby Geniuses in pure evil. The special effects are of course fake, Big Mac Truck looked stoopid with its seat limitations on roller coaster, the murder robots looked like a more idiotic version of the Power Rangers, a big fat guy sucked out of a porthole window ass first and foremost. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr Hopper can do better than this. What really stunk were the two beautiful young things that accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants (??) for a whole two-thirds of the girl! The obligatory "sex scene" (snicker!) Between our young heroes was so poorly done that I almost choked on my tonsils that laughed at the TV screen. The only sign worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain / cyborg / mad scientist. He oozed the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy, but I think he could have been much more threatening. He does and says things that are pretty funny (all the best scenes involve him!) So for the captain I give this movie an extra point. <br /> <br /> But it is so bad that it will make you want to throw abuse on the TV or maybe throw your TV out of the window! It can even kill a few brain cells and put you in a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his peg, when of course it's a fake stick! I would have given it 0 out of 10, but when he jumps me up with his stupid antics ... this flick gets 1/10!
