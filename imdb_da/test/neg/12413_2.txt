Not so much for this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stockcar racer has a flaming car at the start of the movie, goes to the bar, is approached by a biker once who destroys his chances with a very nice lady offering him a job he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go !!! What plays out is a very annoying little movie that sees the hero not all that much and a biker time that can kill, and the police can for some reason not commit a crime to them. I'm not sure why the female cyclist did what she did at the end, but hey it's a bad movie, you always get scenes that don't make sense. I'm still trying to find out if I celebrated it when they said the hero of the play was a stunt driver. They may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and I wouldn't believe it would be anything unusual for a stunt car to crash. The actors are bad and all the cyclists are quite annoying and the hero is a bit incompetent ... really this movie is not full of kicks, but it's pits.
