Sorry for all of you who are not family with Lynches. <br /> <br /> My sister-in-law asked me how to make a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father didn't want to make this movie, they would instead kill and kill people. After each Lnych movie I tell myself again one and a half hours lost by my life. But next time I'll check out the director's or manufacturer's name. <br /> <br /> So you won't be angry with yourself and lose time, don't see it. But if you think you should kill someone, see it, it's probably a better medicine than spending your whole life in a mental insane prison.
