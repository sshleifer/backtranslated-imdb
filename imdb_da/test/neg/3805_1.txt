To get stuck in bed with the flu and feel too rough to get up to find the remote control, I actually saw this abomination from start to finish (how many can it say? And for anyone who can - what is your excuse?). My God, has ever, ever been such a complete mess of a great study? There is not a second of true excitement in a supposed "thriller"; the script is unfortunate and ridiculous; the sets look like they were remnants of a low-budget television movie; and cast ... WHAT WAS THINGS? !!! Sally Field undoubtedly gives it the worst and most embarrassing achievement of any Academy Award winner in history. Her annoying nasal whine and stupid perky behavior in what is believed to be a life-threatening situation is really asinine. It is strange that she did not use all her future income to buy up and destroy any pressure on this turkey. Michael Caine, who is now infinitely pacifying the screen play - even ongoing master classes for wild thespians - has to be taken out and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas' henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actress that I usually like (and whose name is not even in the opening circles, bad soul), is ten years old for her role, and her horrible matronly yellow dress must have haunted her nightmare to this day. Sluming it is Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - hopefully they collected a great pay package to dampen their engagement. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but the one that particularly hits me is the explosion that results in the "ceiling" (if an upward ship deck can be described as such) coinciding and a lot of empty cardboard boxes fall through! Ooh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
