Billed as a romantic comedy seen against the early years of World War II it fails to deliver. The problem is that while it is beautifully photographed, it has no coherent story or story. Beginning as a murder mystery it gives no hope to its actors as it winds through recent history. Depardieu is wasted in a trivial role, of course he is not familiar with playing. Adjani can't carry the picture. The hero is not; Obviously an imitation of a Hitchcock "erroneously accused" role lacks that balance. Neither heroic, cartoon or exciting. <br /> <br /> This could have been a good movie. I am reminded of "The Lady Vanishes", which combined excitement, romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism.
