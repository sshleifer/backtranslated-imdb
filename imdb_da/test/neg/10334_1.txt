But certainly a serious competitor for one of the worst 10 at all times. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - she's on the screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialogue was horrible, editing was apparently done by someone who was tense at Quaaludes, the management ... well, let's Just say my 14-yo daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such a faint praise from me. It is possible that the family cat could have done better. <br /> <br /> Sandra does an honest job for a first movie, shortly on the screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this movie. Stupid story, poorly written and transferred to movies, as only a 7th grade media class should be able to do. <br /> In short, it's drunk.
