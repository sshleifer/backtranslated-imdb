Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie is the Cannibal Holocaust Citizen Kane. There is the stylish play, the terrible dialogue, the half-baked plot, and as its accompanying piece too much in the way of screen slaughter that was actually done. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some ways, the production helps the film to be very sharp and sharp in relation to the Holocaust's graininess. Unfortunately, we again get a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything they get to themselves. There is really nothing in this movie that makes it worthwhile. I was pretty lukewarm with my review of the Holocaust because of some actual attempts at a statement and style, but in Ferox's case there is no reason to see this unless you are solely going on blood and doing.
