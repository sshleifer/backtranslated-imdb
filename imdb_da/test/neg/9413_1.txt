I am usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devil's lawyer), but since the scent of a woman he plays roughly the same role and shouts a lot. This movie had no loving signs to warm up to. Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least sympathetic of the pile. He didn't even reach a real man. Pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness, how old is Renee Russo? The only high light of this miserable mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has 10 lines in total. Even the normally reliable Jeremy Piven was completely inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Note to authors of films they usually do not work unless one of the main characters is at least a little sympathetic (notable exception Scarface). When the movie closes and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was let a plane crash into the airport and kill Brandon.
