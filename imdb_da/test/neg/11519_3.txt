Being one of the founders of my regions, this monkey movie club (this also includes monkeys / chimpanzees and orangutans) I review this movie from a monkey movie point of view. After all, it's a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. In short, poor boy has money for things he wants. Fortunately, there are a few monkeys (chimpanzees) who have a bounty on their heads that would get Boba Fat or Dogs (Duane Chapman) blood flowing. As the boy tries to catch the monkeys, he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the local usirdo, flirts with a girl twice in his age and learns the animal's way of dealing with bullying is to get someone to point to a shotgun. . br /> <br /> There is a problem. So much focus is placed on the boy that the chimps just don't get the screen time they deserve. The chimps are not as talented as the chimps playing Jack from the M_P trilogy or the legendary orangutans playing Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So don't watch this movie, expecting to find the next big thing in the chimpanzee genre. The chimps hit some sweet flips, which is what the movie needed more of. There is an epic scene of the chimpanzees that breaks into the poor family's house and destroys all the things they worked so hard for. Serious monkey movie enthusiasts would like to rent the movie for this scene alone. <br /> <br /> So in closing, this movie is not for the serious monkey movie enthusiast. I would not recommend this movie to families as it encourages a child's rebellion against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well supervised children.
