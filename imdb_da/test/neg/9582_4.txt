I can't believe the number of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles from being an expert and I'll never climb a mountain; But even the very basic knowledge gained from reading in thin air and seeing Everest Beyond Limit and a few other Everest docs meant that this movie just became increasingly ridiculous as it continued. There are some good climbs at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the movie "How Much Experience Do You Have Over 8000 Meters?", I was invited to hope this could be a brave and precise man-vs-nature odyssey. Instead, you have a bunch of climbers who zoom up on a mountain without acclimatization; climbs with goggles in full sun, and they are almost never exhale and perform miraculous endurance. Only near the summit is suggested a bit of fatigue, which dramatically highlights the physical feat of climbing such a creepy top, almost as an afterthought. If you are not familiar with mountaineering, look at it: be prepared for some cliché heroics (though not more clichéd than a hundred other passable derivative flicks) and a clichéd result. I have developed a minor fascination with high mountains and looked forward to seeing K2; but apart from some amazingly beautiful scenes, it was a disappointment because it was so far removed from reality. I can imagine that some experts are employed in the production of this movie, but then one is easily ignored in the pursuit of the heroic and, unfortunately, amazing story. You would also sound like a bit of a lot if you said "welcome to the death zone" of 200,000 feet.
