1993 was a time of change in WWE, but for this Wrestlemania they decided to return the clock when Hulk Hogan returned with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had been out of wrath since a 1990 paragliding accident. <br /> < This was not a big event. Only two games had any real structure, and the whole thing came as a rush. The poor act was not great, and twisted at the end, which I will discuss later, was really not the earth shattered when WWE hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> This unforgettable night started with Shawn Micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the unbeaten Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a few times leading the fight. Michaels had a new leader, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by Michael's former leader and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels kept his title and immediately returned to his feud with Marty Janetty, who was put on hold just for Wrestlemania. Why I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The next time the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeated Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott, scoring the pin after hit Samu with Frankensteiner. Good game. <br /> <br /> Doink Clown needed help from another clown to win his fight against Crush. Another Doink Distracting Crush when he was in full control and allowed Doink to get the pin and victory. Doink was an entertaining gimmick character who grew old quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon easily defeated the recurring Bob Backlund in next match. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the first in our double main event. When the Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the newly turned good guy Jimmy Hart in their corner, took Hart's former friends Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a rather outlined finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial treatment and had wrestled the fight with a face mask. Shyster knocked off his mask and beat Beefcake into a pulp. The judge went down, Hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster and then Hart, who had a judge's home, counted the three. Another ref came down and reversed the decision declaring Money Inc winners of the DQ. Next up Lex Luger or the Narcissist, whom he was also known at the time, defeated Mr. Perfect. This fight arose because Luger was led by Perfect's old manager Bobby Heenan. Perfectly had his feet on the ropes when he was blocked, but the judge missed it. <br /> <br /> Undertaker tackled a weak DQ victory in a rather poor game against Giant Gonzales. Undertaker had served in Gonzales' manager Harvey Wippleman in 1992, and Taker had defeated his great monster Kamala on the Survivor Series. Wippleman promised revenge and took it to Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Taker and cost him the fight. Gonzales dominated the Undertaker in this match, but was DQ'd to choke out with chloroform. Nice finish for a bad match. <br /> <br /> This bought us for our main event as WWE Champion Bret Hart, who was seriously challenged as a champion for the first time, put his title on the line against Mr Fuji's unstoppable monster Yokozuna. Yokozuna controlled the early time, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in the shooter, probably he would give in and Hart would be established as a heroic hero after taking out the big monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt into Hart's face, which gave the Canadian's helpless when Yokozuna got pin. <br /> <br /> What a downer ends. But wait here comes Hulk Hogan. He controls Hart to make sure he's okay. Suddenly, Fuji Hogan is challenging a WWE title right now. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt against Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan hits the fall and wins the fight and the title. What did I just look at? And so what most fans thought to be the night we either saw Hart establish as a giant killer or Yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw Hulk Hogan pick up a meaningless title victory. A title he would not defend for three months. In fact, this was the only match that Hogan fought for WWE before the King of the Ring PPV in June 1993.
