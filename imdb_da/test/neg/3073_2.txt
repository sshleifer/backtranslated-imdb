Some movies are so poorly made that they can be seen exclusively for the cringe factor. Disciples made me hug so much that it was uncomfortable. I saw it all out of what I was looking at, wasn't anyone aware of how bad this was while filming? Among the most hammered performances of the most wooden actors, a creepy script, all the comments from all the "actors" sounded as if it came from the same character and the fastest editing that attempted (and failed bigtime) to give the movie a forced pace. All of these are combined in a movie that robs you of a few hours in your life and gives nothing in return. Avoid for every price.
