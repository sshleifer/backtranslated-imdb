This really is one of the most horrible movies from all the time. It is dull, obscure, badly acted, and teeth searched pretentious. I saw for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold before you realized there was no. The shot on a shoe strict budget was particularly painful. These must be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from outer space. The only barely redeeming feature is the ridiculous 'demons' wandering around the country with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I thought that moggysne were used as extras, I suppose they are at least cheap. Although it was a little obvious that they had been lured to the camera by careful placement of a tuna. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that it should have a health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I took it back, where people demanded the money back. I'm not asking you!
