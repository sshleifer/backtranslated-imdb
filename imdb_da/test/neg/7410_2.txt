An aircraft carrying some scientists and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary invent, falls into a jungle in the Pacific. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition, led by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a large company that owns the prototype and father of one of the researchers. There the group finds the rest of the plane five miles far from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the people. In addition, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, is chasing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I don't know what I'm doing and spend my time in this waste. The direction is horrible, the actors and lines are horrible, copying parts of `The Predator 'and even' The Blair Witch Project '. To sum up how bad this movie is, the best scene is when Marla Lawson, Andreas Roth's character, gets hurt, and the expedition guide says she should have an injection of tetanus vaccine. Andrea holds her jeans, and the guide says, "Beautiful ass, but the shot must be in your arm." Ridiculous! My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
