Evidence, if ever there was a need for evidence, Hammer should have turned their vampires into the Victorian age. Vampyrism, after all, is about repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in 1972 London, with its thirty things pretending to be randy teenagers. Remember that at that time Hammer was badly floundering. The public was tired of the comic horror of the 1950s and 60s, so the study tried everything to bring them back, including abundant nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, et al.) And updating their characters - none of which apparently served as Hammer was pretty much resting in the grave just two years later. Shame ... But I still have a great love for the classic Hammer period from 1957-1965.
