First of all, "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the small town of Furlough in Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title so it would give some extra bucks or something. And I suppose it actually works because that's why I bought this piece of shit, it sounded so stupid. Still, the film is not good. In fact, it's bloody terrible. But I didn't expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you enjoy low budget horror with poor dialogue, actors and some gore then check into this movie. But I have to warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst plays I've ever seen. The actors are trying hard and it gets ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this very wrong tone about everything they say. It's so silly, it almost looks like a freakin parody. It's as if they only shot each scene once and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blonde girl who has to play a bimbo. She is the worst of them all. I've never seen an actor as bad as her (and I've seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can't stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures in this movie were actually quite good. Those who are shot during the day are all quite decent for a low budget project. But most of the film is shot at night when the Chupacabra frames and the lighting is too dark. The gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are pretty hilarious really, but that's the way I like it. Chupacabra looks pretty messy and it's easy to see it's a guy in suit. All in all, this movie should only be seen by extreme fans of low budget flicks, and it's very important not to see it alone because you're likely to be bored to death. I recommend watching this flick with your friends and a little beer.
