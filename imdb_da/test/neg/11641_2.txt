Why are there no good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Seen in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who sets up with a hysterically incredibly racist officer, and just as hysterically, the road is the character of the Japanese officer's brown nose, Jim Brown's character. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie any of these actors have ever done. Stereotypes are not only great, but dominate this movie. The 60's and 70's may be the best thing about the movie, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> It's even hard to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun. This film is even more racist than the announcement of racism that it is trying to deliver. And believe me, I lived in the seventies, and we thought it was just as stupid that it was so stupid. It was never popular.
