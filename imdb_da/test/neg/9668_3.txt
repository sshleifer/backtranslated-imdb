Visually, this film is interesting. Lights are literally thrown in a way together with filmography and an appealing introduction before the titles, which had my hope at first, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much play is seen. This film surrounds Albert Fish's life, one of the world's most famous serial killers. Active around the beginning of the 20th century, the fish's life has been rapidly and unclearly treated before he started killing children of an old age. This movie is based on two tracks: The Life of Fish and William F. King's Leading Investigator of the Case. What saves this movie to become a Hallmark play and debacle of the usual kind when it comes to serial killer movies is the direction that is a double-edged sword; Director Scott L. Flynn focuses enough on the b-players not to let their mistakes shine through too much, but at the same time created a truly dull and stereotypical perception of the American police through the king's angle. Certainly, he treated quite thoroughly with Fish's meeting with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl he killed, even though I'm not quite sure if her mother was the mediocre person Flynn really tries to emphasize she was. I miss more psychological diving in fish, not to mention the very little time spent on the fish mailing. All in all, interesting for those who are into the serial killers, but mostly an easy-down; But if the director wants to make another movie about another serial killer, I would certainly see it in the hope that the holes were patched-up.
