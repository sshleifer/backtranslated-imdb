I just voted 2/10, mainly because Hitchcock agreed to lead it. He certainly had an off-day with predictable plot lines, stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be fun. There were "two" hygenic, sanitized, emasculated "sex" scenes at a time when the Hollywood production code was in full force. Just male characters in the movie, who like "soap" characters, never make a kind of work for which they are paid. It always annoys me when food is usually never eaten by actors (an exception was in the dining room of "Tom Jones" (1963), although large amounts of drinkers have been used to let the mouth be free for the next line! Carole Lombard has certainly mounted Hitchcock's "cool blonde" idealized picture of a heroine, but what ever had him to lead this worthless unfunny script, he should have attached to his thrillers. Don't wait for it to end, as it eventually annoyed me.
