So it is Friday night and you want to watch a movie ... all you want is something entertaining, not too artistic or something that can require a long night of philosophical discussions. Then you pay $ 10 to see Mod Squad. The trailer for this movie should have knocked me off, but come on ... it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people - eye cakes. But it's about it ... a number of moving Prada ads. And what did the Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around the streets for some unknown enemies? Where are they? But quietly, after a while you will just stop taking care. I was about to leave this movie because I thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall could have been more productive (and free) but then it was over (90 minutes - it only saves grace). So, still willing to waste $ 10? Go, get yourself a nice hot meal.
