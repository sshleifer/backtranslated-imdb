When the word "gifts" finds its way to a title, prior to a famous name, the work is usually rejected immediately. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art do not seem to be able to see it in others. However, I have always been willing to try the second installment of the Demon trilogy. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to adjust that kind of talent on Demons 2's soundtrack. For another good, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course she was eleven when this film was made, and some years away from her apparent decision that she would style her after early Helen Mirren: steaming looks and some clothes.) Likewise, Lamberto Bava comes from one of Italy's finest dynasties in the odd horror subgenre known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who may have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original demons are an absolute must-see for fans of the eighties B horror movies. So how bad can it be? Well, bad. The demons continue their attacks on Italian media as the film opens in a modern Italian high-rise, where many people go about their lives, having their television in the background. They all look for some sort of news report / feed video of some investigative reporter types trying to get evidence of the events of the first movie (which seems to put the time frame for this one no more than a few days after the first movie). Through the usual horror movie extra inability to concentrate, journalists manage to bring a demon back to life and he comes through the TV screen to start the plague again. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's so bad. About the only good thing to say about the movie is that the soundtrack (when not asked by people like The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is amazing. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, which started as part of the Argento dynasty and has since been scoring such films as Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> If you plan to drink heavily, do half a decent free rental, but this is certainly not near the fun of the original. Cronenberg's wonderfully fun high-rise creature, Shivers (aka they came from inside), is much better.
