Cartoon-like special effects, horrible plays and dialogue and dry plot! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could have fun with, but it was just too much. The film begins with a woman and her son, who are vacationing on a built island in the Bahama region. The women who just happen to be a doctor / virologist are in the area when a man collapses. He has a strange wound on his arm, and she knows immediately that it is a contagious virus. The story continues to show starting fast romance between the two teenage leads (this is justified by the girl saying "I know it's fast, but it just feels good." ????) Yet, the whole island gets infected with this virus and The CDC is brought in. We are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and contained, it spreads to the United States and kills millions of people. This information does not stop the CDC from leaving the island to save itself. Fortunately, cure exists for this terrible virus just in time and the whole island is rescued. To celebrate the beloved death, the people have a shattering party where everyone dances, has fun and forgets the terrible epidemic that has just happened.
