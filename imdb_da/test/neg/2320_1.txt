For some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think because my great uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant of this movie, and my father-in-law thought I'd see it. I had years before as a child, and neither could it. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, saw it and was hooked. Every waking moment in front of the TV played this horrible video. I went to work with the inane songs stuck in my head. The two "leads" were worse than a junior high stage review. The dancers resembled rejections from an Ed Wood horror flick and Abbot and Costello phoned their parts. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it was the band from "The Ring". To correct another reviewer, Buddy Baer UNCLE of Jethro (Max Baer, ​​Jr.) is not his father. 0 out of 10
