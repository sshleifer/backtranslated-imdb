Well, I'm a big fan and supporter of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought this on DVD from eBay for my boyfriends birthday. We sat down to see it and it was so boring. I can't remember laughing once. It is only for about an hour and a half, and it seemed to end forever. Elizabeth is great in this though. Maybe it's just because I'm a big Elizabeth Berkley fan myself. If she wasn't in it, I wouldn't have seen it, but every time she came on my face lit up. Unfortunately, Elizabeth couldn't save this movie. Just the overall story and horrible comedy make this a movie you'd rather miss than wasting an hour and a half of your life. It's a very forgetful movie.
