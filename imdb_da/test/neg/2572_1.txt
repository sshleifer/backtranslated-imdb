This movie is undoubtedly the worst action movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be a serious one) reaches a chicken speed across the road, on foot, at about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing error makes the movie completely hilarious for about 2 seconds, then it is back to "stop on the edge of your seat while trying to find a comfortable position to sleep in, action!"
