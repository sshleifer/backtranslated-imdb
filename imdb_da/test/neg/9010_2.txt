I accept that most of the 50 horrors are not scary of today's standards, but what the hell is this? When you see a title like this, you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty animal. Instead, we get no blood and an animal that either wants to take over the world or live in peace on Earth .... yes, that's what the people wanted. <br /> <br /> The overall story is great with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the animal .... but the title really kills the movie. The night of the animal would have made the fans more happy that there really is no blood to talk about. <br /> <br /> I like how the 50s movie had endings that left room for a sequel, but wisely never did one. This movie is not the worst I have ever seen, but it's almost up there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
