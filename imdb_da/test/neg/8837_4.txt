Sad to say this is one of the sillies of John Wayne's series of western poverty line for Lone Star Productions. Here he is an American marshal on the edge of a bandit who is only known, I do not ask you as the shadow. No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's some guy who gives his orders through an open wall for sure, so his men can't see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you know within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is completely wrong, no squeals or groans from the audience would have happened because Gabby Hayes still played a number of roles and he is clean shaven here. He had not yet found his niche as the beloved oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes as Duke. <br /> <br /> Later, he leads his men openly in the climax so I'm not sure what the meaning of the original gimmick with the wall was safe. I don't think those who wrote this knew either. <br /> <br /> Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian sidekick here, and the relationship is pretty much the same as an unmanned Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> It's all pretty silly if you ask me.
