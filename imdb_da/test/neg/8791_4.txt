Ridiculous movie where two swinging college students move to California, and you become the movie star and the other leader. <br /> <br /> As 10 years of age, the popularity of the star is declining, so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for his love. <br /> <br /> The movie is uncomfortable and ridiculous. The girls who fight for girlfriend are made to look stupid. Only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show. She is really an amateur against some of the other women, but she is healthy and also gives good ratings to the show. <br /> <br /> On the third scene, you realize that the leader falls for her. <br /> We know Ryan was really supposed to be a bachelor. While the end is a bit sweet, you really know where it went.
