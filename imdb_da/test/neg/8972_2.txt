Stage star Grace Hayes stars in this fuzzy little movie. After many years on stage, she has to visit a small college town to check out her son who is raised by her grandfather. The child does not know who his mother is, and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he is a boorish jerk. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. Interestingly, it turns out that mother is really quite wealthy and has not only funded her son's life, but is a great contributor to the college. So she has the idea of ​​forcing the young man to mature. She speaks to the man who raises Peter and has his allowance cut off altogether - hoping he will rise to the apartment. It also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks that all these children should stop playing and be more responsible. Now is where it gets pretty stupid. To show they know the value of hard work, she hires a bunch of them to sing and dance at the malt store she just bought. Talk about constructed !! What happens next is as a long and not very good talent show or perhaps a poor man version of a Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney musical! I would suggest that the children try to do something else to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay them to stop! I know I would pay them. Considering that the talent is far from talented, Peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous. It's all a bit difficult to take. Not a very good movie at any sane standard, this is a fuzzy movie that should have been unclear! <br /> <br /> Thus, it is interesting that Mrs Hayes' son in the movie Peter is actually her real life son. The only problem with that is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really horrible actor. He is not beautiful enough to be a leading man and he comes out as either boring and uninteresting or just obnoxious. In particular, all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the gelatin that you scrape off Spam. Despite this awful performance, he continued to have a relatively successful play. Who would have thought if you had seen him in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here he is as welcome as Bubonic Pest !!
