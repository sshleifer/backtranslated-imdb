Maybe it's just me, but this movie seemed more like a sequel or follow-up than the separate project. Why? When it was filmed (just a few years after the war), most of the viewers knew why Rommel was so famous why his death was so important to Allies, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now 50 years later it is not. so obviously more. "Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel" is a decent war movie, but it's just not in any way explained how Rommel got his nickname, what he does the Allies considered him their best overall, why their soldiers were so scared of Africa corps? That's what is missing in this movie - we see his fame, his character, his way of treating soldiers and enemies, but f.e. we also see that Hitler complained about his performance in Africa, he calls figs etc. So we lack the big picture here - it's "The Story of Rommel", but unfortunately the "Desert Fox" part is missing.
