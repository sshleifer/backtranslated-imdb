I can remember this movie with feelings of purity. . . pain. More than half of the film is advertising (no, really!). The little excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost is!) The end result is a prefabricated love story of predictable schlock that is clearly thrown together in a scary commercial attempt to wring some more money from today's Debbie Boone hit. Yep, it was so fast it was produced ... the song that "inspired" it was still great on the cards when the movie was released! <br /> <br /> Despite decades of bad movies, this still impresses me for its extravagant, non-obstructed, headlong jumping into the most boring, absurd, and indelible cinematic frivolity. It really deserves to be on the IMDb list of the 100 worst of all times, and has never left the top 3 on my personal "worst" list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the pure masochistic excitement!
