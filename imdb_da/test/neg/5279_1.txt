Low budget "movie" like this just gives me hope as an aspiring scriptwriter. In other words, if there are people out there who are willing to fund a piece of schlock like this, then there is certainly much more than a glimpse of hope for someone like myself who can actually write stories. This movie is just up there or should I say "down there" with Ed Woods of the world. The story, if you can call it that, and the dialogue, not to mention the sophomoric performance, is a travesty to the genre itself. Someone should have run a rod through this stink while it was still on paper. It follows that since the literature has been largely killed, the film must follow. To get a good or even just passable movie, you should at least have a proper writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak runs in mind. They used many of his stories for low budget films far back, but they still come today as good, serious entertainment, that is, "Donavan's Brain". Cast for this "work" should seriously consider going back to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future weak attempts to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this as the plague itself !!!
