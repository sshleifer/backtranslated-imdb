Most of the movies I really like are the art house ticket and are rarely seen on the top ten lists on the box. That said, I found "Northfork" totally incomprehensible. I have no idea what it was all about. Writing in the New York Times about another movie, Stephen Holden once observed that some people seem to think they can just throw something up the screen and make it work like an adventure. I thought about this review several times while I was watching "Northfork". <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave it two.
