First, there are some plot holes in this movie. We see at the beginning that a child dies from playing the game. But who was tied in the mailbox that delivered the package that contains the game? How did the driver place the package in the mailbox when he was lashed to the wheel? It's not like he was Mr. Fantastic. Wow it in just the first 15 minutes ... The actors are second rate, take the "Bad Guy" as Patrick Kilpatrick (who?) Just played in an episode of everything on TV and some secondary roles in bad movies (like this one) . So most of the play is like TV dramas, I can live with it, but the graphics or special effects are terrible. The disembodied "Game" voice sounds like a bad clone of Hal from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from the "Apes Planet". Foreigners had transparent organs like shadow zombies. In most cases, the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda. The story was a good idea, but as most good ideas discussed over lunch, was never developed beyond the good idea stage.
