The experienced actors in this know how to act and have proven it before, but the director, who also wrote and produced this travesty, is incompetent at so many levels. OKAY. It's low budget, but I know movie students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors who can do much, much better. For example, when there were people who needed to know better, some of the gunmen were out of place and never existed these days. The stunt work was clumsy - the story outdated and hokey. If someone gives you a copy of this use it for a coaster. By the way, I love westerns and have known many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors so I was looking for it to be good.
