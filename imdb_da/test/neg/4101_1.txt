What could have been a good story was ruined by the ridiculous travel scenario. If something had changed earlier, changes evolved and people never evolved, the time machine would never have been built. If something of the past was brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past. I really wish movie producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before completing the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume that time is possible, stick to the logic. OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to have a good time with his best performances. All the other actors seemed to do the best they could. It was the letter that made them twist in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the future" handled it better.
