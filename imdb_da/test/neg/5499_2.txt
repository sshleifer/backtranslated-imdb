I have previously loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. Costume drama scenes in the beginning were the kind of poorly finished, stodgy stuff that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the main cutting scenes that just left me cold, and that was the kind of thing that should mean something I would think. Yes, there were some lovely bare trees and fog evenings, and the rider jumped out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the film was just boring and meaningless.
