I'm sorry, but this movie is just the way to make it for me. In it, Perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend Keitel who tries to do it as an actress. First of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after I've seen this, I still don't know. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her as a loving puppy. There is no reason for love, it just happens kind of. There are times when signs and events are really trying to draw on your heartbeat, but it rarely works. The only sign you really feel for or with is Keitel's character, and that's only because he's doing so well with it. Any other actor and character would have been like the others. Scripture is basically an uninspired rehash about how hard it is to do it as an actor / actress. It has been done and said before, the language and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a street pimp. The end is ... Well, I don't wanna spoil it. Let's just say it feels unsatisfactory. I would be sorry if the story was good to start with. The management is average with nothing really wonderful, but nothing really painful to see either. To repeat the play, the only thing worth doing is Keitel. Although I could have lived without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear. Oh yes, Eddie Bunker shows up. As random as it is mentioned, it is so random that it is in the movie. And Tarantino does his directorship a favor by appearing for about 20 seconds.
