totally useless ... having been there, done it with the subject I must say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect. It may have done so if the characters had not only been mouthpieces for incredibly gloomy, unrealistic drifts. So many cringe-worthy scenes that would put the office to shame (not a compliment to this movie). It may also have helped to get something highlighted by a story, a point, a message, a comment, something. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this film (the concept is used very loosely in this case). There should be minus numbers reserved for movies like this one. -10 (extra turd)
