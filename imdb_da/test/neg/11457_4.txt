Not all movies produced in 1931 are this creaking, and the fact that this was "best picture" must have given even greater impetus to the development of television. Typically for all Ferber novels, it is not possible to bring the whole story to the screen, not to say anything about developing character. Dix - so solid in the first third of the movie - makes a face, but no one knows why and that makes no sense. And what about Dunne who does, makes her so stoic? Edna May Oliver's scenes are invaluable as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie has a role to play in the history of the cinema, but it is long and boring.
