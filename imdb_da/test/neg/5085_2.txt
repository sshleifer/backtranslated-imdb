Although it was difficult, if not impossible to see, and not because of the horrors it portrays, but by the way, they were depicted. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this real horror story. What I am protesting against is the idea that it is necessary to terminate what I subscribe to. How about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema. I feel the filmmaker's zeal, perhaps even the justified anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. Or if it was a cinematic point of view, I think, a choice, then I could not like it at all. I was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the film itself. I am fine, but unfortunately this is not enough.
