This brief review contains no spoilers as the film destroys itself. It's wood and pedantic. It has no saving grace at all. If anyone invites you to his house to see "Mr. Empire", don't go. Even the title of the movie is horrible and portends what garbage is inside. The whole plot is so bad that it could drive Mother Theresa into despair !!! It was not a stroke that led to the early death of poor Ezio, it had to act in this clunker who made him in. It must have haunted him the rest of his days. Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge over the Americans for his imprisonment. He found a perfect vehicle for his anger in this travesty.
