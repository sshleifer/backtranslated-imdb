Another ridiculous lamb and sensual low-budget sci-fi TV presentation ?? but actually its kind of fun ?? kind of ?? in a passable undemanding way. Will I be soft? I don't know why they come with these titles. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes there is a cobra. But what is the deal with 'versus' between? Sure they are going to blow ?? in only two sequences (one recapping an event and the other being the risky climax) and rather boring exchanges I might add. The uprising is the same old routine for a scientific experiment that comes out of hand on a secluded island (no dinosaurs about), and some innocent spectators (environmentalists hoping to postpone animal testing) are caught in it. This sees a comodo dragon and cobra becoming massive in the statue with the government soon to destroy any kind of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing the island. So it leaves the surviving races against the time to find their way. The prominent staples consisted of horrible video games CGI, hack script, few sniffing sets (although the tropical island setting was light on the eyes), throwaway characters (but I found the show exhibited), lifeless sticky tension (which for some reason was held using the same repetitive shots of the victim who just stands there in the terror, which I hinted to wait, eat me now, I do not go anywhere and in the end they were swallowed whole? Almost as it always seemed to take another gulp to end them or just save the hassle by stupidly squashing them) and a very hysterical edge with some form of misery among the survival acts. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be on cruise control all the way through. Michael Par√© has fun with his mining dialogues, and Michelle Borth added much needed sparks. Renee Talbert is there to pout a lot, also with success.
