This show sucks. It was put on Friday on the roller coaster, and although it undoubtedly destroyed the ongoing theme of Friday programming, I have to judge it rationally ... still I think it sucks. It's really super lame. Zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really upset. <br /> <br /> The lame continuity and pot sugar and I reckon the dialogue and joes are weak. The weak humor and lame sucky characters suck, and the whole show is honestly a disappointment not worth seeing. It sucks and is really, really lamb. It really has to be one of the loudest shows on television, really not worth seeing. I mean how lame weak and sucky can a show get before it gets axed?
