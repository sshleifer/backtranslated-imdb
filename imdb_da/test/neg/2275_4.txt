Okay, if you discount the production value, the ugly clothes and the big hair, this adaptation is still far less than the 90's version. First Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot) is literally ten years old to play this role, and her acting leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (plays the same role in the 90's version) can express more in his big, brown eyes than Firbank can with all his face in a four hour production. Anne is transformed into a whipping, whining, boring character (and what was the scene during the long walk where she stops to equip poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa looked so much that the only time I could tell them apart was when they were standing next to each other (Henrietta was higher). And Louisa! Never was there a more unpleasant character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth would be interested in her. She must be high-tensioned and beautiful and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh, which is like nails on a blackboard. When she starts singing, "to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme," I began to shout, "Shut up, shut up, shut up!" The best part of the movie was when Louisa dropped the three feet on the cobb because I knew I shouldn't see her anymore in the movie. Talking about the fall of the cobb scene; It was a lot of badly built, badly edited and edited scene of the whole movie. How does a person fall three meters down, landing on her feet and still being beaten unconscious? <br /> <br /> On the plus size, the nature of Elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version. They also put in many more scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end. <br /> <br /> I admit I bought this movie, although I knew how it was under par, but I'm a huge Austen fan, so I want to buy movies adapted from one of her novels. See this step if you're morbid curious, or appreciate the 90's version even more. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, this version can follow the novel's letter, but the 90's version follows the spirit.
