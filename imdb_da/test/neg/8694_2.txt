It's hard to compete against classic grandeur, but once you've chosen it and the decision is in play, find the best and clearest resources to keep your product's top drawer and the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for the second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? It is with that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and sent. I want to ask the producers, "What were you thinking about? Were you trying to create an expected deficit?" If perhaps the producers thought, "We will examine this biblical story from another point of view ..." Then I would say "OK, I looked at the show, what is the point of view?" The premise of this "possible point of view theory" avoids me. In general, I can see programs, and (right or wrong) at least get a sense of what the creators were trying to achieve. Not so here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and I can associate his work with some eye-catching product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history and cartoon entertainment. A perfect genre for the Sci-Fi Channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the meaning of these ten commandments, what were you thinking about?" ???????? FJS
