I'm a fan of low-budget B movies and campy horror flicks, but it was too much even for me. <br /> <br /> If you get past the weak plot, the cheesy effects and the uninspired plays, then the horrible writing will kill you, or you will want it. The dialogue was probably written by high school stoners who believed to say "Mr. Yes, Lord" over and over again, made these guys more military. <br /> <br /> The characters were all the typical cardboard stereotypes: Gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho other guy with sensitive side, evil scientist with secret agenda (bald or of course), bitchy brainy chick who would be hot, if she also tried, stupid sexy chick with vital information, idiot "genius" nerd, random other sorta military dudes who die soon enough, and spoiler character alarm, crazy scientist who was responsible "until something went horribly wrong" oh yes i Almost forgot, there is a secret military (marine) submarine, sitting on the seabed, 5 minutes from HQ (or so it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and dead bodies. Your mission is vague and poorly defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you see this, don't say you weren't warned.
