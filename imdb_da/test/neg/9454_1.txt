How poor is this movie? Well, I got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about ... <br /> <br /> I've also paid Â£ 1 for this on DVD, the old story of 'put-a- the new -cover-on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it syndrome. All I really remember is that the throw ran around a lot, the use of cars must have been over budget and that a vampire was involved. Then again, guess you could know it from the movie title. <br /> <br /> Just for video waste or just for cheap-jack DVD as it is now. These things will be in Copenhagen at rental stores, supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun. Only cockroaches will control the earth, but this trash can still be around. God bless the beginning of the DVD age ....
