I have read all reviews for this directly for video movies. I can agree that the movie is not "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact" quality. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so, then it is a movie that is tolerable. <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie early in the AM hours when I made some nerds things and cases. It was very nice because I was able to switch back and forth between what I did and watch the movie without missing a stroke. It's a predictable movie, and the play isn't up to par for some of the veteran actors (for example, Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I should point out that I only paid $ 2 (US) and as the old saying goes: You get what you pay for! If you are looking for a deep meaning movie that will make you see it over and over again, then it is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you're looking for something to pass the time, then there's nothing wrong with Tycus (As coincidentally called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico, where I found this video).
