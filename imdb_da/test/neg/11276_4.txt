Looking at this movie, with its deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clich√©s and chopped feelings, can anyone be so naive to believe that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You see it in an attitude of disagreement. Hollywood biopics are not based on individual lives anymore, they are just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life, it would be filled with such a perfect synchronization that you would hardly recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be wiped out by some explanatory, simplified backstory. Your story would look like "Rocky" because it's the only lifebuoy Hollywood knows how to produce more. We couldn't let the audience think about something that was open when they left. This movie does not trust an audience to find out things without being led to them. I perceived the captain's / mother's reference eons before the film literally made it to me. I could see the 25 kids twist coming in days. <br /> <br /> This is a very average movie. Not terrible, but not great. Therefore, it is likely that it will be drawn with a couple of Oscars next year. There is nothing that the Academy likes better than to congratulate itself for finally noticing patterns over the previous thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the New Yorker article "Lost Boys" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /> <br /> "Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also loved his boys and it may be unfair to find Findland to omit him to streamlining from the scene, when Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, while Arthur lived a lot when Barrie first came into the consciousness, and gradually the home of the Llewellyn Davies family. <br /> <br / > "Finding Neverland" is a weepie. From the moment Barrie met George and Jack and began to consider the means by which they could be immortalized, the story is sad, but the reality is even darker: 1907? Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies of cancer 1910 ?? Sylvia dies of lung cancer The five boys are orphaned, Barrie made their guardian 1915? George killed in First Wo rld War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders 1921? Michael, a bachelor in Oxford, drowned while swimming with a friend, the two bodies once they have been rebuilt gget is glued together. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies threw himself into a London subway train. We must not assume to read a mind in torment, but we must note in passing that if he had lived another month, he would have reached Barrias centuries-old and thus imagine a fresh flurry of interest in "Peter Pan" ?? "the terrible masterpiece," says Peter Llewellyn Davie's words.
