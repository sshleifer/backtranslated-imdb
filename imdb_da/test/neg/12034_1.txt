I'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. This movie is a confusion of his work. I agree with the other commenting - this movie was a terrible disappointment. I would give it a zero but have to give it a 1. <br /> <br /> The story was weak and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie So look back at it and realize how terrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made. It's really amazing how strict can be drawn to get something done. If this movie was able to make it public, it puts great hopes on other indie film producers who have talent worthy of a curse that fights! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. Of all accounts, this was seriously not meant to be a comedy. Scary movies are a better game on a horror genre - this movie just sucks.
