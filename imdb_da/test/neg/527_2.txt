This movie moved too slowly to my liking. The concept of history is refreshingly different because it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on the screen. the execution of the concept was incorrect. Each character was fully developed within its first appearance, then one had to endure the feeling that each character drew water in the rest of the way. It is that each person fluttered awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie, which I thought was a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has artistic merit, given the irony that history centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above average intelligence friends and family. However, the action was well done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the film was beautiful. In summary, I think the film has a strong artistic profit due to the fine a cting and cinematography, but fails at an emotional level because of the described shortcomings.
