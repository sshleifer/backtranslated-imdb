The Hebrew hammer is a smart idea wasted, as the performance is weak. As if it is often the case with iconoclastic humor, it depends too much on generating laughs, which is simply not enough. Bad taste humor has two elements - bad taste and humor - and both are needed here, but humor is pretty scarce. As a result, it is often painful to see the more because of good attempts at the artist's side, especially Adam Goldberg as HH himself. The Shaft references are fun, but only for those who know these movies, and they certainly don't carry the Hebrew hammer. Another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of American Jewish culture, and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes.
