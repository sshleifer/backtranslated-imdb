Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson provide great performance with Southern / New Orleans accents in this detective tab. It's worth watching for their scenes - and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors notice to entertain us no matter what the movie looks like. The reason for the film shows the potential, but one gets the impression of seeing the movie that it was not pulled off as well as it could have been. The fact that it is the mess of a rather unattractive plot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers really confuses things. The movie is worth seeing - if nothing more than entertaining performances by Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
