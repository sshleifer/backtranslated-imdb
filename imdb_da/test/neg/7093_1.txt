The moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, poor posture, poor jobs, and over and over again. They are, of course, miserable and deceiving themselves. But if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be wealthy, successful and attractive. <br /> <br /> TLC should be ashamed of itself for this obvious exploitation of parents' fears and guilt. If nutrition is so important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I'd like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what their eating and training habits were like kids and age progress the kids' photos. Then compare with the real thing. Hey, it sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - Are You Listening? <br /> <br /> The TLC stands for Tabloid Lies and Cons.
