One of the worst shows of all time. The show would begin with cleverly robbed comments to each other that would be completely out of the wall and unconditional. The fat computer nerd was incredible, the Bible, the bad ass girl, who are these actors ??? Never heard of any of them except Cole who was absolutely incredible in the section. Every time he opened his mouth, he expects to hear, "You see children ..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. Somehow, this show makes a slug like Ice-T more credible as a policeman, and he wrote the worst song about the police ever recorded.
