Although I rarely agree with the film chronicle, I must say that this film, while not horrible, just didn't make me indifferent ... and it all seemed to be out of place ... it had its moments .. Three or four that made me sneak ... but most of the time I was wondering why? Why did the characters do this? even Hot Shots characters felt more thoughtful and fluttered out ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice Norwegian movie, then watch Pistvakt. There were more than random ethnic groups who just went around shooting each other at the Swedish tundra ... I am so disappointed ...
