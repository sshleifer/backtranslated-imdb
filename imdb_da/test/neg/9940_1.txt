Heftig and Begeistret is a documentary-like story about a men's body up in Berlevåg in the northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark in winter and the cities are facing young people moving to the more populated parts of southern Norway, where the climate are warmer and there are several options. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this movie is the people themselves. The people of the choir, who are from 30 to 95 years old, all have unique colorful lives and are very fun creatures. They are characterized by the harsh climate and the recession in the north and have adapted to the way of life. Throughout the film, we learn a little about many people in the choir, and we follow them through songs, some events in a church and at the harbor, and finally a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> External environment filmed in the film is very beautiful and characterized by the Norwegian nature. Scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir, and from the citizens we live as we meet. They are living rooms, the bathroom, the boiler on the oven; There is nothing artificial about this movie, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. Everything is as accurate as possible. <br /> <br /> Everything is lost, but when it comes to giving a story. It is very beautiful and right, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or is it simply to see a story about Berlevåg Mens-Kor, about their lives and some of the tours they have. The message, if any, is that this small community survives through such social events as the choir. The choir has kept the people together for many years. That's good, but it's something that is as popular as it has been seen, with almost 200,000 in Norway. There is no beginning or end to it. No one wins or loses anything, no one reveals any message or tries to convince the public that this is good or that life up there is great. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a good movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - it doesn't deserve a 9 out of 10. It's closer to 4 out of 10, and that's what I want to give it. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age of the audience to be about 55-60. It has reported consistently high in all theaters. Perhaps it is also the reason why it gets so much praise in the news and good grades also on IMDB: It is a film about elders, for the elderly. It's a movie about "I'm not sorry about anything in my life", and a story that says that you live in a small town like Berlevåg, can also be a good life.
