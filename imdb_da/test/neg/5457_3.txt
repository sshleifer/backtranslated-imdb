Television director uses astral projection to kill people who take the form of the blue man. <br /> <br /> Dull uninvolving horror movies just sits there for your eyes and makes you wonder why you see it. I sat through the movie to the end and I really can't give you more than a brief account of what the movie was about because I kept finding my attention derived from other things. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend this. I think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that I paid a dollar to the DVD as a dual function, and I feel a little ripped off.
