ATTIC starts well. The little boring story is greatly helped by the two main actors, and there is a glimpse of a character study going on here, but the film goes down when Carrie Snodgress's character buys a monkey. Not one of the cute little monkeys. She buys a really big chimpanzee !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot unit basically kills the movie. It's just not conceivable for a woman like the one Snodgress player who has difficulty doing something because of her dominant father, for her out of the blue, buying a chimpanzee. I mean, come on! Forget it!
