Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a strong member. Kong used to be something fair and impartial and had a number of guests. The party also used to be a centrist, but it was another era. Now, like Larry, it's far to the left. At least 90 percent of all guests at the King's show in the past year or two are liberals sitting there bashing President Bush and all conservatives they can think of ..... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous, is - and you can see it - the most frequent guest in King's TV show. You can count on other incredible Left Wingers to be at the King's Show every week, but don't hold your breath to wait for a conservative. They are few and far between. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the media's overkill innovators. It all began with O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night, it's all you've ever seen back in the mid 90s. Regardless of the latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith or the Petersen murder, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or any other tabloid topic, you can bet that Larry puts it to death. Unfortunately, all the other networks are doing the same now. Larry was a leader in that respect. King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice, such as on marriage. I'm not kidding; I heard him say it. The wit is that he has been married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has few scrubs, believe me. When it comes to morals, he is clueless. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil, to explain some life facts to him regularly. Larry will nod but he doesn't understand more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him. <br /> <br /> King is also known for the softball interview, which means he doesn't ask questions. It is very much because most of his guests are of his political persuasion. People at the King's show want to have an hour's public relations concert. What all this has meant is a serious fall in ratings over the past five years. People look through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid TV mentality and switch from King and CNN to Fox News.
