I'm a great MD fan. But I call it as I see it. This film limped together. The reason was prevented. Accessing the head of state in this movie is easier than accessing the local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has the feel of a wooden board. Relax! Editing is crooked. The actors, and I use the term loosely, sound like they are reading their lines on valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that just scream, "Stinker". <br /> <br /> To watch a good Dudikoff movie, I can suggest Crash Dive or Deployment Force. If you have never seen one of his films, this is not the one who introduces you to his work. You will go away with a bad taste in your mouth and think all his projects are so bad.
