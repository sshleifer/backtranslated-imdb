well i would probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly i thought it was such a piece of shit i think the actors had made a terrible play and the script was all terrible. Although the special effects were not a little bad, but I think they should have thought much harder than that. I think how Clara Bryant was successful in putting into this movie, I think she would do much better if she looked a little longer, and the same with Kristen honey, I think she is drawing, and she bears Don't try and defend yourself, I think it should be a total joke. She must at least do much better than what she does, become a soldier or more of a heroine or something with bravery. But the point is that the actors did a completely fun miserable job, and so did the director and author who made this movie. They should have gone to film school to think of some better ideas, and I hope everyone agrees with my methods because they are probably thinking of the same thing.
