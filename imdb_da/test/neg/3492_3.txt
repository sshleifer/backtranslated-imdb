Considering the incredible reviews of this movie, I expected something quite unusual. It certainly starts well with a witty and sharp dialogue and a nice cast in place. A series of Robert Altman-style interwoven stories rolls the viewer into some convincing scenes. I found the poignant entertainment all the way to the other half of the movie when it sadly collapses like a packet of cards. A number of ridiculous coincidences and real messages are stacked up until I am very disappointed and wonder what all about it is. Paul Haggis has tackled the subject race in LA, and that alone seems to have raised this movie to a new level of interest. Given that most of the academic voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this movie will certainly affect them. This means that Oscar for Best Picture will go to the race movie or gay movie. Let's hope it's the latter because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.
