I give "Flashdance" a lowest rating of 1 in 10 because it is no more than a series of music videos with a movie card surrounding the music videos, to clock in as a movie of its own length. Since then, does it count as a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer who has an incomprehensible job as a welding machine in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a work style, most older women find themselves in, much less 18-year-old fresh out of high school. Meanwhile, she works as an exotic dancer who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy fate called Mawby's. Another look at the well-choreographed and well-polished dance routines makes the girls every night at Mawby's, you think they worked at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her age. Having resisted Nick's progress because she doesn't start with the boss, she's unable to get in the way of him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship at work, which makes no sense how it will likely look to Alex's employees. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most time throwing mood tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss / girlfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she throws a tantrum. She grimly tells Nick that she is not doing the audition because of his intervention, and then he comes out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just a scene that lets you wonder what the hell the decision makers were thinking when they did. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alex eventually gets her audition at the conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the conservatory, which is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yes it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can judge whether Beals can actually work well from what I saw in "Flashdance". That's because the character she's forced to play is so poorly written that I don't think it's a fair litmus test of her acting. <br /> <br /> You must give it to "Flashdance" decision makers though. This film proves that the poorest filmmaking can be covered by a sleek marketing campaign. In this case, the best-selling and award-winning soundtrack and music videos for the soundtrack are in strong rotation on MTV. If they had spent more of their energy on the script writing, they might have got a plot and a story of characters that I cared about. Instead of what we get, stock figures are put in ridiculous scenes that any viewer with a functioning brain cannot take seriously. A truly forgettable "movie".
