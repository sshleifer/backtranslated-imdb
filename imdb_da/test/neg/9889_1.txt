This straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story. I have no doubt about that. It does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a large, big old country home really really cheap. Well, as we all know about watching Horror movies when buying a large house cheaply, it usually means it's haunted in some way, shape or form. In fact, the second house handed over to Angela, the wise guy who lived in the house until now, takes a moment to "introduce" Angela to one of the ghosts! Good guy, huh? Angela comes in contact with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come over and see the ghosts for themselves. They come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts that walk around, sitting on the sofa, hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. A few friends sleep overnight by the party, watch the ghosts and never promise to come back to the house. (Check out the girl who deadpans "I'm so scared, I'm so scared." Totally numb. If she was so scared, why didn't she get up, turn the knob and leave?!) The ghosts don't really do anything threatening except show up (and there is no blurriness or aura about them. They look like ordinary people). They steal celery from the kitchen, move chairs around a la POLTERGEIST, and a bisexual female ghost seduces Angela who doesn't make it think! This scene plays like the kind of soft-core porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Ummm ... not that I wanted to know! Hahaha). However, the actresses are not your typical porn stars. They had to beat the beach and the gym more. When Angela's doesn't love the dead, she gets angry with them and stands alone in a room that screams: "Why don't you leave? This is my house! Come out!" They do not leave. I couldn't help thinking of all the times I heard psychic Sylvia Brown on TV and saying that if you have a ghost in your house, you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say, "Look, you're dead. It's time to cross over to the other side. In other words, come out! "According to Sylvia Brown, as long as you are not hostile and nasty about it, they will leave! This movie looks like it costs about $ 50 to make. It has a really cheap feeling and bad acting. I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a video camera.
