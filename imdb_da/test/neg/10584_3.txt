It is not fair. I really expected this to be a fun, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be sown on since his earliest classics, airplane, and naked gun. But after watching Superhero movies, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It would just have been anywhere near $ 9 a. Ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because it would summarize for the hour and a few minutes. And as disappointing as this movie, I was glad that time was so short, if not shorter. I just can't believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary and above all STUPID, some of the scenes were! And over that I have seen better acting from a tree dummy (without ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin purposefully made a movie that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than "Meet the Spartans". Very disappointing indeed.
