Although this is one of John Cusack's and Demi Moore's early films, it is a consistent hardcore fan who can miss unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. I have rare moments where I can handle Better Off Dead, but this movie is ultimately worse. I'm just not a Savage Steve Holland fan and he did both movies. So if you don't like cheesy, random comedy and amateur animation, remove it. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: she can't sing and the 80s synthesizers didn't save her. There are too many predictable phrases and too light jokes. I suppose if you want thoughtless entertainment or something you can go on in the background and ignore while doing something productive then go for it. Otherwise, don't watch this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) couldn't save it, you know it's going to be bad. They are the only reason I didn't give this movie a 1.
