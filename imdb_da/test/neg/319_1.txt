If you are looking for a masochistic excitement, hire this movie and show it to a group of your friends sober. This movie is just flying, but it's not totally worthless. The short breasts are good and there is a victim's death that is fun as hell. Apart from that, this is just garbage. But it's still better than "Grim" or "Spookies"
