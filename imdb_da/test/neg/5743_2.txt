This is a relatively accessible movie (+1). After watching UKM: Ultimate Kill Machine, it looks good in comparison. There are no obvious technical gaffes, although the vampiric teeth look strange. <br /> <br /> History line makes no sense. Let's see. An American GI is fighting vampires. Coming back to the states and rehabilitated to see ... Vampires. His commandant is the aunt of his former wife. Who happens to do some research on the biodiversity in the South American area where the vampires are. Huh! Don't bend too many coincidences. Who cares about the main vampire? Or his daughter? Or anyone in this movie? The only originality in this is that most myths about vampires (allergic to cross and garlic, cannot get out during the day, etc.) are wrong. But they cannot be killed except by pouring or cutting wood into the heart. Yeah right. It is obvious that they just wouldn't film a dark movie, as this is made for television movies. It would have been good for the viewer if they had hired some actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman) and a big, black guy with an incredibly deep voice who wends to show off his vampire denture. But otherwise you would never know that they had actually paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough combat scenes, and some vampire-biting blood, but no real violence.
