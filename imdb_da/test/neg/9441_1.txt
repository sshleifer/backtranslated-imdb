This film has absolutely no redeeming properties. It's not even worth being in the 'so bad, it's good' category - it's simply bad. Poorly acted, badly shot, poorly written, poorly directed, horrible sound recording and everything is just incredible amateur. Clearly how this got a release is beyond me. Oh, and could anyone tell the leading actress that if you play 'sour', that doesn't mean you have to constantly stumble on your hair - in a movie that was generally annoying, this was probably one of the most annoying thing for everyone. On the plus side, I think this is the only movie that ever has a Nazi carjack ...
