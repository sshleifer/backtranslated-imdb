I have to admit that even though I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I was never really familiar with this game. And what I really can't say is whether this is a bad fit or whether the game is just a bad choice for movies. There are some good businesses in it, but the performance is very lumpy and the plot is obvious. The game's theme is about the nature of the debt using the economic idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional issues. It becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, which unfortunately falls into the garden of black anti-Semitism in spite of Bart's best attempt to save him with a couple of great monologues. <br /> <br /> Outside of Jeremy Irons worthy turn, I didn't think there was a decent pile of performance. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a small whine added to the end of each pronunciation, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard "Pacino gets angry" scene, which his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is quite embarrassing, to the point where I would have thought they would have screened tested her right out of the picture early. When she goes incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we don't have to laugh at. When Joseph Fiennes stands there and tries to look sincere and complicated, it is difficult not to make devastating comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in "Shakespeare in Love." The big problem though that over-rides everything in this movie is just a lack of emotional focus. It's really hard to know if this movie is trying to be a serious comedy or a strange stupid drama. Surely a good summer stock performance would twist more laughter from the material than this gloomy production. The actors seem to be embarrassed to try humor, and are uncertain of where to place dramatic and comical weight. All this is basically the fault of the director, Michael Radford, who seems to think the material is much heavier than it looks to me.
