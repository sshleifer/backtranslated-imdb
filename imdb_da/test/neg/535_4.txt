I kind of had some high expectations for this movie. I have always believed that Tom Selleck's lesser-known movie (ie Runaway and Coma), how well over those he had more pressure on. Perhaps the producers have had a little more knowledge about former big league baseball players who became stars abroad. The majority were players for good at triple a baseball, but not exactly Major League Matériel. I admire the idea of ​​putting Selsel's character in Japn, as opposed to the cliché of playing in minors. Unfortunately, this movie, like the title of the post, is stranded in the third of a movie that seems to run on autopilot. I didn't mind seeing a sequel, and hopefully the producers would learn from the mistakes. The pastor is just too unique to stand alone with this uneven flick
