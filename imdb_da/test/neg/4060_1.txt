[WARNING: Some spoilers included, even if it is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of the directors D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, which include MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM., I would highly recommend all great documentaries. By seeing this ultimate boring and unconscious account from the Depeche Mode's 1988 tour, I realized that they had nothing to do with going to edit this movie together. The band members were certainly less than coming on the camera; Therefore, the competition to add fans on a one-week bus trip was added to live things up a bit. Really, now I mean, don't. Who thought a concert movie of a synth pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? Permitted, I like Depeche Mode's music, and Martin Gore writes good tunes, but watching them in concert never seemed to be interesting, and this movie is proof positive. Unless you are a huge fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary .... it's a complete waste of time.
