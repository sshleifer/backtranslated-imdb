This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. There is a huge spider, but all we see is a bone. There are some worms that live in a cave, there are just cheap dolls with sock teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that doesn't make sense at all. It's all just ridiculous.
