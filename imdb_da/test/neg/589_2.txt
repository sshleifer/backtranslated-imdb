I will never come back in the three hours of life, this movie is stolen from me. The film is basically a psychedelic drug hut that is hidden as an important creative process. I want to know what they were doing when this movie was made. It is also the most historically incorrect movie in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place. <br /> <br /> Characters are odd, designs are simplified, and everything just goes without meaning or logic. <br /> <br /> And the end is probably the worst: it should be thought-provoking, but the only thought that came into my heart is "What F $ * K is going on?" <br /> <br /> I would say to anyone seeking serious entertainment, avoid this movie at all costs and choose a sci-fi movie that is NOT stuck in their own @ $$.
