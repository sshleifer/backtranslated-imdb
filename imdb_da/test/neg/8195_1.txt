I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back. It was so bad I can only remember scenes that just made me die laughing. The only plot collection I can give you (without any spoilers) is a picture of a home video made by college children who were tall. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler alarm starts here ...) When the movie starts, a guy is running, being chased by "Demon Cop", when in fact the man was really chased by a Halloween costume wrong. A car pops out of nothing, hits the guy who was driving. It sends him flying over the top of it and what does the driver do? Watches man as he falls, comes back in his car and drives away. What kind of hairy hidden would it do? I would at least have asked if the guy was okay. <br /> <br /> So a black black guy stares at Demon Cop right in the face, then later tells journalists, "I didn't get a good look at him." My sisters and I were so stifling ourselves to death. <br /> <br /> Then there's a scene in an alley where this girl with an afro pulls a machine gun out of her teeny-little little purse. It couldn't have FIT !! I can hardly remember certain scenes. Maybe it's because they were just so bad. Cops in the movie can't even skip a fence, and the play is so wood, it makes wooden planks look like better actors. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie brings shame to Hollywood, far more than any other flop could. You have to see it to believe in the sappy cheesy plot that it has nothing of as far as I can tell.
