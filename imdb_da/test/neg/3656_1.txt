From reading the back of the box, my first thought was that this is probably a knock from case 2. I couldn't be further from the truth. It seemed to me that they gave someone with down syndrome a camera phone and $ 10.00 and told them to make a movie. The reason did not exist, nor the action. It was almost as if I saw a silent movie about grassland. It didn't surprise me at all to find out later that the whole movie was "improvised". By the end of this "movie" I had lost the will to live, and I might have got AIDS right from watching this movie. It was about 70 minutes that I could have used to do something that was less painful. Like jumping out of a building.
