I remember turning through channels on HBO and saw this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no tension in this movie. The story starts with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure), driving to a small town while in trance. She stays with a couple who randomly had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked like her and played by the same actress. Even the mayors agree that they looked like each other. Thing is, Laura was killed a year ago. Her boyfriend passed around at the same time when she was murdered, which made him look like he had killed her. <br /> <br /> As he settled in this city, Drew began to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares can prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the killer. Throughout the film you will find that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) is the one who raped her often over a period of time and killed her. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long and very boring. The movie just pulls in and out and on and off. Amazingly I saw another TV movie after this called (Klonet) 1997, which was good, but I will review it later. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie from 1997!
