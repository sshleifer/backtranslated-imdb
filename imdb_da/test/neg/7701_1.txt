Do you want a good recipe for errors? Take a crappy, left-wing political plot, add some weak and completely undeveloped characters, and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. Leave the stew for a week (the amount of time spent probably doing this trash can). The result is 'Steal This Movie', a movie experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places that were never seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie completely blew lumps in my face for the entire duration. Words cannot convey how painful it was to see. This is not one of the bad movies that you and your friends can make fun of. This is not 'Plan 9 from outer space'. This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'Steal This Movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. It suppresses me when I realize that people * actually * took time out of their lives to shop in this tripe if you can call it "acting". But then again, when you have poor direction, poor writing, poor ALT - "action" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a great, obnoxious turd that you long for to quickly flush out of existence, fear that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. I really wish I could somehow destroy all copies of this movie so that it won't pollute the minds of hopeful filmmakers. Thanks, Robert Greenwald, for giving me beginner respect for any other movies I've ever seen. You have shown me what is really terrible and why I should appreciate all the movies that are only crazy and / or boring.
