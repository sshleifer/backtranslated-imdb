Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well once more as Chappy Sinclair, who goes to Doug Masters (The game of Jason Cadieux, who is in favor of Jason Gedrick, who wisely rejected) to learn a new band of recruits though this time discovers the corrupt air force pilots who deal with toxic waste. This is a series that just gets worse with each subsequent entry, but this one does not have a zip or even action to make this even worth watching. Iron Eagle IV is aimed at such indifference that dogfights come out as if we saw a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It's terrible to see and Gossett Jr., who has made his share of turkeys, seems to have tied out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Esser: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do everything as long as he works. As I look at his post Oscar wins. Some of his better films are Iron Eagle, The Punisher and Principal. Indeed, given that the latter two films have contributed to him along with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it is something to say that three guilty acts of joy are underway for his better work. Of course, Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best post-Oscar winning work. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
