We thought this was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to see the end. The romance was not credible; the characters were not developed the love affair hardly made any sense; it was overlooked; and the scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATION ... just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and the outer lanes do not typically look like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in an under a hurricane if it wasn't theirs. Also .. it was not realistic. hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the shutters. <br /> <br /> Also, the vein was redundant; and did not match the story What has the civil war anyway abroad? I must also mention the wardrobe ... should D. Lane have a scarf / pashmina / shawl on each scene? It was overdone. She looked good that he didn't have to hide things; without making them obvious as with light slacks. Finally, I am concerned about the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid and I mean STUPID movie !!!! Don't fall for the hype on this one !!!!!! We did. Not even ready.
