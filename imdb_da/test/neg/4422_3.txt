"Stealing Time" actually goes back to 2001, when it was mysteriously called "Rennie's Landing". Which explains how director Marc Fusco could afford this cast of now established TV / movie actors in what is, of course, an extremely low budget production. About ten minutes into the movie you understand why this thing never got a theater release after making the film festival around several years ago. <br /> <br /> The recent distribution of Franchise Pictures probably reflects a perception that the increasing popularity of some cast members can be milked to restore some of the modest production costs. Although it is not a good addition to anyone's resumption, young actors have done worse things when they desperately sought plays of all kinds. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play colleague friends who make an early "Big Chill" association and compare war stories of reality to their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes Alec (Facinelli) dreams of a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery, which is then "cheap and paralyzed" for completely inappropriate music. It's the least exciting bank job since W.C. Fields was vigilant in "The Bank Dick". <br /> <br /> If someone can point to a moment in "Stealing Time" where something "actually" happens, I'd like to know about it, as far as I can tell, nothing happens in the whole movie. Perhaps Fusco, through incessant visual reflections, tries to say something deep about taking control of one's life before it's too late. Like "St. Elmo's Fire", the film is filled with every in-depth thought ever spoken by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. I felt that Fusco was for some kind of Howard Hawk's young professional in action "angels only have wings" motive. So again I'm sure I read too much into the movie. After all, Howard Hawks film actually happens. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
