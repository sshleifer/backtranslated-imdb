Yet Mr. Costner pulled a movie far longer than necessary. Except for the fantastic ocean rescue sequences, of which there are very few, I just don't care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is realized early and then forgotten until much later, after which I didn't care. The character we should really worry about is a very cold, convincing Ashton Kutcher. The problem is that he comes out as a child who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and doesn't show signs of a messy closet. His only obstacle seems to be over Costner. Finally, Costner tells us about Kutchers ghosts when we are way past the semiconductor point of this stink. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best without prior clipping or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to stop turning off for an hour.
