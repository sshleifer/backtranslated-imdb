First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie, I felt like I had been sold a listing of goods. Remember it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listening like a comedy first and a horrible second (though I don't know how it's written ... maybe some moron from the movie crew put it in). Being the fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it out based on it, and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch my beginning there is no comedy in this movie. It tries once or twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. My reaction rolled mainly my eyes and wondered why anyone thought that such tired material would be fun. There is also no horror here. Not a second of excitement can be found. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No excitement, very little blood and not much violence on the screen (sorry, but in a horrific cut off just as the good things start is a big foul). Hell ... there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist or juvenile ... I prefer some in a horror-flick if it can't come up with an original plot / premise. And as tired as hell "reality TV show has gone wrong"? It has been done before and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... ummm .... no matter what movie was called with Edward Furlong. It's so bad that this movie is. I can't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. I also enjoyed the one comment that states the time this was good because "reality tv takes over". Has anyone from the past sent it with a time machine? Are you freaking fun me? This thing is rubbish bin ... and not in a fun way.
