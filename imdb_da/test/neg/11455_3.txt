Cimarron was painful to sit through. Although Irene Dunn does a great job with the powerful script, Richard Dix's pompous and exaggerated role is brutal. The passage of time has not dealt with the character of Isaiah, but also other racial and religious beliefs, yes, even though the film is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the abuse of Indians. The editing is particularly weak. This is undoubtedly the worst of all the "best" pictures.
