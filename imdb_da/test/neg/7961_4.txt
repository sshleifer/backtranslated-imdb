If there is one thing I want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here, then I am the Queen to find weird movies in thrift and dollar stores. That said, you may not be able to imagine how happy I was when I found this. <br /> <br /> I can even remember that Saturday morning when * every * station simulcast it, so you were stuck if you wanted to see something else (so again, I think it was the idea). As a child I didn't know if I liked the way all the different characters stood together (there are some crossings that just do * not * work). But I suppose the particular had the intended effect. You must not do drugs because you will have nightmares about Muppets. <br /> <br /> Now, if you see this as an adult, you'll be treated to the * weirdest * antidote film this page of "Reefer Madness". I think I'll just leave it before I get into trouble.
