Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hate, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how having fun with or having fun with a dog (which is also animal abuse). Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner forced to make these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I strongly believe that these types of movies burn the heat of fire and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This community continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to humans. We call ourselves "civilized", but I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.
