Ever see a movie where Chuck Norris takes the evil guys aside and discusses with them the mistakes in their paths until they see the light, and with tears in their eyes they cry hands, the wrath of the world brings peace and harmony and for forever end the evil government in the world? <br /> <br /> Forget it, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" Instead, go straight to the drop-kick as our truck driver drives his big rig into the little backwoods town where his little brother is held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt lawyers. <br /> <br /> Chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle cuts every baddie in sight, until a vicious person dares up with his head. Many battles are in slow motion, for excitement purposes, but just help put the movie out to fill 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> And there are many battles here, leaving only approx. 15 minutes to plot development ... and it's all about the plot you get. But what do you expect: calm discussion? <br /> <br /> A star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; And it's a little 10-4 good friend.
