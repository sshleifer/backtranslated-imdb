Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, is a dark, deep and lasting novel depicting the present-day and irony of Africa. If you are looking for a great book to read at the weekend, this is not the book for you. Conrad does not hold back when describing imperialism from the 19th century, but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel looking for a great fairy tale story, I would say that I wasted my time but looking at the perspective of explaining the contemporaryity of the 19th century civilization, I would say this is one of the most significant novels I have ever read. Because of the fact that I read this novel in my English class and we analyzed each page, I think I appreciated the book more than anyone just reading it for entertainment. I will not lie, this book was difficult, and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. The film, on the other hand, I found tedious and boring. The film, "The Heart of Darkness," does not come near, giving the book justice. The movie released many important parts, which I consider important to get the true message of history. If you find it difficult to understand and visualize the novel, then the movie can be a great help, but I do not recommend watching the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.
