It's not just that the film is paralyzed. It's more than that. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another Western? What about a Western with African Americans in the titles roles? Sound silly, unlikely and a miserable attempt to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly slippery and simply set. It's such a paralyzed Baz Luhrman movie "Romeo and Juliet" where he put it in modern times to attract young people and create a bit of hype with his renewal of a classic tale. Well, Baz Luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. The story is actually not bad, but the whole idea of ​​removing racism out of a racist genre by casting an entirely African American cast is racist in itself. It's also puerile and simple minded (like the Baz Luhrman man, he's a bad instructor). Hi (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He's also in the movie! How can it be racist? It is not. I said the idea of ​​casting all African Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, it is just meaningless, silly and very boring.
