I should have realized that a two-video set sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before I watched this movie and it still didn't swing me. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> A patchwork of film, video and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of a chapter in James A. Michener's epic novel. Now the time period covered a chapter, but I cannot remember many of the situations that actually occur in the book. Packaging on my copy of the movie gives Maria Conchita Alonso top billing - though it turns out she is only in a speech scene. On the second band. The actors have to be praised for playing their roles well, despite a smashed, overwhelmed script. However, they must be offended to accept the roles in the first place.
