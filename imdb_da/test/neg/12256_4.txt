EXCELLENT <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A Lesbian Couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a remote country The house is run apart by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes), who turns out to be a carnivorous alien, anchoring a massive invasion ... Despite his booming budget and launching pacing Norman J. Warrens Follow-up on SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) represents much more than the sum of its lean parts thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently his only written credit): Faulkner and Annan indulge in obsessive relationships while living in isolated splendor within the English landscape (reproduced alternately beautifully and viciously by Derek V. Browne's eye-catching film), although Annan's discovery of blood-covered clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these eyes lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective fam ilier, some of whom seem to have lived in the house at some point and "left" under mysterious circumstances. Stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship to disarray, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred for men and partly because Annan is attracted to him and creates tension that results in a climatic storm wind. There is an extraordinary, multilayer order in which Faulkner tries to "emasculate" their clueless visitors by dressing him in women's clothing, though Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery. <br /> <br /> In early scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with exceptional grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic co-operation is rapid in volume episodes of sex and pulchritude culminating in a horror explosion when Annan allows himself to be ravished by Stokes for a violent argument with Faulkner. The final sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially Annan's final scene, which seems to have been cut for censorship in 1977 and never completely restored (what's left is still quite alive, so brace!). Outstanding performances by the three leaders, backed by Warren's motionless direction, taking full advantage of the stunning forest areas, thus compensating for the film's budget deficit. Originally released in the US as ALIEN PREY.
