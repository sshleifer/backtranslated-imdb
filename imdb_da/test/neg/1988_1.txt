The prerequisite for this movie is ugghhhh. The guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "Yes, it's fun, sweet and a good movie." What the heck?!?! What is fun about immature girls fornicating with a married man with a new baby? What's sweet about cheating his wife? What has it been wrong with them to find some teenage boys to have sex with before they start college? Noooo, it's not good enough, the guy should be married, off-limits, off-the-market, that's what we need. Dumb-ass GIRLS! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. No, she just loves "the way he makes her feel. Two of the girls have fun with it, they think it's fun, and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing. but yes it is all good with everyone on this site. The dark-haired girl even has the courage to get her father pick her up from the boy's house, during the baby's sitting. He screws baby sits.
