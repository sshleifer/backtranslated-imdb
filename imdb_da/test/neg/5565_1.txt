After some misfires, we are still waiting for the French horror movie, which critics will certainly vilify, but will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline cannot be accused of not knowing the genre. He is the editor of a high-quality fantasy print. He has worked for the legendary magazine Starfix.) But why a scenario that uses EVERY clich√© in the book (except perhaps the Odious Comic relief)? Why make it so predictable? Even the nods against Argento fail flat. It is not even a euro-teen movie like the German "anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that have almost no relationship to each other and contains lots of plot holes. The whole "Celtic" aspect is barely touched. And after an "income" painfully predictable, the manuscript gives us a dull, infinite hunt in an underground necropolis that seems larger than Parisian catacombs. I would really love this movie. Really. But even a mother wouldn't. Oh, and the author Valerio Evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo, but I tried in vain for him.
