There are some beautiful scenes to look at here if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see some of it. I'm a big fan of slice-of-life movies, but these people are simply gentle. While there is nothing political here, the whole movie can be seen as a political statement, showing how communism destroys the individual, making everyone the same gentle animal who just uses his life to sleep, eat and sometimes love.
