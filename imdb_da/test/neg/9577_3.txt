This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who not only has the best years behind her, but also has a pea face that makes her look like a freak. But in Madrid, a professor, she knows, conducted some animal testing with a substance that regenerates cells. The trials were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because the professor will not allow Dr. Bannister being the first human guinea pig, she kills him and uses the drug. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also an evil killer when it comes to keeping her secret a secret. The movie's plot is fun, but Piero Vivarelli didn't have enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it. The movie also gets boring after a good start and can't recover a fast pace, even though the movie's running time does not exceed 83 minutes. And as the setting changes to the Swiss city of Geneva in the last third of the movie, it sometimes even looks like a holiday movie, as we see how beautiful Geneva is (as it actually is - but it doesn't help push the plot forward. ..). So with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "Satanik" could have become an unclear Italian classic. But as it is, it's just a dark and boring crime movie that's not really worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
