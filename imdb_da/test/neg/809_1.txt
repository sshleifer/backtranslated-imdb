Don't watch this movie! It is ... repulsive! The start is actually very good, but in the middle everything drops and I really regret to spend $ 80 (about $ 11) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to get people's interest. AWFUL picture! The only bright place is Robert Gustavsson's fantastic work, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> Hope you take my advice ... The picture is bad.
