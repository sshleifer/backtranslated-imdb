I went to watch the movie because my boyfriend rages over how much he wanted to see it and how his friends were already and loved it. So I came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst. Unfortunately, that's what I got. I could write a 15-page paper on why this is easily the WORST movie I've ever seen. But to your advantage, I would point out the benefits and the endless supply of disadvantages. Initially, the actor was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved a laugh and a couple of exciting scenes. Unfortunately, good acting, a little humor and excitement are where the good points end. The whole beginning story could have been great. A Jewish girl's family is slaughtered, she hides, later meets the man responsible for her pain, and then hatches a large plan of revenge. Sounds Good But the movie would not be quite as "satisfactory" to the Americans and the Jews who yearn for Nazi blood. I have no problem with WWII movies or kill Nazis I saw Defiance and like it a lot. But that is the way and attitude ours would be heroes kill. I will give you an excellent example of the kind of hypocrisy that this movie oozes. Our hoodlum gang backs a German unit and kills / scalps them all except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to pass on information about another German entity. When he "respectfully refuses" to betray his fellow soldiers' lives, he baskets his head in one with a baseball bat, cheers and swears as if they were in a football game. They took the Nazi head out of yaaayy! Now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. Here's a hypothetical situation: A group of American soldiers is hit and caught by the enemy. The same scenario follows, and the American commander would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. The enemy bases his head in with a big party. This would confuse an audience if this scene was in a movie. The American soldier was a hero to place his men over himself, and the barbarians brutally murdered him! Reach? What about the Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves to die the dreadful death possible, right? Randomly, the Nazis felt the same against the Jews. See the hypocrisy? By celebrating the Nazi butchers, we place ourselves at the same sadistic level. Great hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis make a propaganda film about a German sniper who kills nearly 300 US soldiers. At the end of the film, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts giggle with joy as they see an American soldier being shot out of a window and falling into a fountain. The Nazis rejoice as a soldier after a soldier falls to sniper's skills. This is supposed to regret the American viewers of this scene. The evil Nazis laugh at the death of our brave men! Good is the irony, isn't it what we do (or should do) all the time we look at Inglorious Basterds? Frightening over others' pain simply because they were "the bad." How would we feel if Indians somehow made a hit movie where they raised bloody revenge on the American settlers? Or what if black did a movie that glorified Nat Turner Rebellion? OK enough about the hypocritical errors. <br /> <br /> I will summarize other reasons for 1-star rating. 1) There were views of admirable signs throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking her finger in her shooting years because he suspects she betrayed him. He's the good guy? 2) Scenes dragged far longer than they needed. 3) Brad Pitts Southern, allegedly Tennessee accent is HORRIBLE and thoroughly annoying throughout the movement. I want to stop now when I'm 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general population does not seem to think anymore, they just want blood. And so this movie got such a high ranking. I recommend this movie to the ignorant or if you are Jewish and simply want a good "fantasy justice". Personally, when I finally got out of the cinema, I felt as if I had been scaled (or wish I had it, I didn't want a little over 2 hours of mental rape).
