In the third tranche of "Left behind" it was not true that the decision-makers were putting any kind of continuity in the plot. Although all the weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations, the Second World War suddenly begins with a finger. Within a few seconds, the ex-lover of one of the protagonists moves away from passionately seducing him to the hatred of a melancholy decree of love without trace of direction. <br /> <br /> But above all, this movie is really an iron-free zone. After the US President has accepted Jesus as his Savior, He immediately becomes a suicide bomber and bursts a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
