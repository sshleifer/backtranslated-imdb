Webs start in 'Chicago: Present Day' as four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) are interrupting the electric to an unused building planned for demolition. When searching for the appropriate cables and things, they come across a set of doors which, according to the buildings, blueprints should not be there, be curious and everything they force the doors to look and find a room filled with computers and scientific machines. When they crunch around with some buttons, a portal to a parallel universe opens, Dean & Junior with Ray & Sheldon subsequently fall for their friends. Unfortunately, they all end up in an exact parallel ground that has been taken over by a mutant spider that either eats people or makes them mutant soldiers she uses to protect herself and do what she really wants. In a desperate bid to survive, they stay with a couple of the last remaining people, including the original inventor of the portal Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says using our electrician he could (maybe) be able to build another portal to take them home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu I thought Webs were beautiful, it's as simple and straightforward as it really is. The manuscript from Grenville Case & Robinson Young is terrible to say the least and has plot holes in what you could run a tank through, for example, this movie is really trying to suggest that a few mutant spider things no larger than a few people in size took over a whole world? How did they do this? If this parallel land was the same as ours where hell was the army? The police? All our weapons? A few fragile looks spider things against literally billions of people? The whole flawed, stupid and fair naff concept constantly bothered me throughout the film. Let us not forget that there is an interdimensional portal to a parallel ground in the basement of most buildings that have been effortless for decades and remain in perfect working position, right? Then the nuclear reactor is the size of a folder, the fact that an electrician can make it work completely by accident when he randomly presses a few buttons in a room that probably had the 100s spread over dozens of equipment and what about the wonderfully thought-provoking guy who puts an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone what if one of his comrades had put it off and found himself blown to pieces by their helper's homemade bomb? You wouldn't be best satisfied would you? What about food? Do they rise into small vegetable patches? I could go on all day long about how failed, poorly conceived & poorly written webs are, but I can't be bothered. The character is clich√©d and annoying, just like the film as a whole, which apparently does not help. The only half decent thing I can say about Webs is that it is short and it moves at a reasonable pace, but when all is said & done it is still bad. Director Wu has to take a big bunch of blame here, for a start sees the movie out cheap, and the editing he is credited with is horrible. There are lots of annoyingly inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere, action scenes are almost identical and become incredibly boring very quickly. He uses the very annoying quick-cut technique along with a bit of the old jerking camera movement, now I don't know anyone else, but I hate this editing style, as it just sees a complete incoherent mess. In fact, I don't know a single person who likes this kind of thing, and I'm amazed at why filmmakers think people are doing. Forget something gore, just a few shotguns for the spider's zombie soldier guys & they don't have red blood anyway, so it doesn't relate to the reality of my mind. Webs were made for -TV, the American Sci-Fi Channel I think & it looks a bit like cheap, low-budget and hasty as you would expect. It is so bland, forgettable, flat and boring. Special effects are far from special and the spider lacks imagination when it is finally revealed. The action was OK considering everything else was so poor and I still can't believe Grieco's shirt was on this. <br /> <br /> Webs are shit, I can't really say anything good about anything other than me. I've been through worse movies and that's the only reason I don't give it 1 star and a fast look at the IMDb user rights for Webs confirms what I already knew it has more 1 vote than anyone else and there is very good reason why ...
