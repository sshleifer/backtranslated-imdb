Could easily have been better. In fact, perhaps so much that if the filmmaker hadn't tried as hard as he did, it could actually have been better. <br /> <br /> On a good note. The lighting was reasonably okay. But pretty much everything else was missing. Wobbly camera work. (Yes, yes, I know it should be the style now.) Poor recorded sound. And editing that looked like someone looked at too many Ulli Lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies.) To sum up, the movie seemed to be a rationalization for the director / author / protagonist to get some young women naked them in false bondage and pit them while they say "threatening" things.
