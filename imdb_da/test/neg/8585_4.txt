Stone has tried another type of film. Any given Sunday is below an average The Last Boy Scout and below average against all odds. Stone can be amazing, see The Doors, Natural Born Killers or Platoon, but he can also repeat himself see Nixon or Born on the 4th of July. His real brilliance is realized in Michael Caine's perfection, The Hand.
