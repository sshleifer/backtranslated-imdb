It was only until I saw Sidney Pollack in the picture that I had ever attached to this movie. This is his worst possible movie. Absolutely drunk. The dialogue is wood and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There is nothing about her character that makes you believe in this story yourself. Harrison Ford is like Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the error in this movie. Scripture is horrible and he is too smart not to see it. So it tastes like a payout, whether it's a study commitment or something else, but it's just BLOODY ROTT!
