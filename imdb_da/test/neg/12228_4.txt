It was just a matter of time that a spear would be made of sports film! And there are lots of movies to be spotted, which are made fun. But the biggest problem I had was that it remains by recognizing movies. The director and authors of "The Comebacks" forget in a way to become creative. While I have to admit that I was laughing at certain scenes, the "comebacks" could have been so much more fun. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a pretty face throughout the film. A spoof requires this, and that's the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the lack of throw to do so, the jokes never beat their mark. Some scenes take forever and usually in spoofs that don't have to be a problem. Take e.g. "Naked Gun". Their is always something that happens on the screen. In "The Comebacks" they did not even let things happen in the background. Only a few factors make this movie worth seeing! It is still fun to spot the movies that are being made fun. And Jermaine Williams as the Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as the radio was fun! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of ​​what a spoof is about. Not quite bad!
