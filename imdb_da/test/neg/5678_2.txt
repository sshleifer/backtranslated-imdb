I was a great "SNL" fan back in the days of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I have tried to see it for more than ten years, I have been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it. Ten years ago, I thought the performance could not survive as it was so utterly deprived of the kind of humor I could understand, yet held it together, as I have always found horror and wondering how in the world someone could possibly find his lama humor at all fun. When I've switched on the last decade, I've never been happy that I did. In fact, I've always been annoyed to myself to quit and waste my time. For me, the absolute low point came several years ago, when a popular young male actor I liked much was the guest's host. At one point that night, he played a big star, perhaps himself, and in the dirt, the sign "Mongo", which I played by Chris Kattan, again seemed to end in the back seat of a car with him. What followed was that Mongo was forced up and down and up and down the actor, screaming hysterically when he was probably sodomized. The audience laughed their heads out and I shook my head, surprised that they could find it extremely fun, surprised that NBC would even send such a thing. Over the years, I have repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind and hope that it can regain the wry sense of humor I loved for so many years. But until just a week ago it hasn't done that for me. Not even close. One exception: During the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was great, and she was the only practitioner to keep me tuned. But the Sarah Palin sketches while they were hysterical were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes and I would always regret not turning it off as soon as I heard the familiar "It's Saturday Night !!" !
