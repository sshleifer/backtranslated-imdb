Sci-Fi channel thinks this is Sci-Fi; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, on and on, they persist. <br /> <br /> Someone at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they distinguish between total waste and extremely high quality sci-fi. <br /> <br /> A few years back they knew how to go all the tall and powerful and produced productions that were not just for us Just lama-o Trekkies. Thank you, Sci-Fi! You know you're making movies so bad, even Trekkies won't see them so you've reached your goal! Fire hose, Isspiders, Manticore, Larva, etc. And a great relentless leaning storm later, and they are still more than the last influenza virus! How they do it is beyond my knowledge. Why they do, I just don't know. How they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and emails, I don't know either, but it is clear that they do not think much of their audience or care about our opinions! They seem to think that's what sci-fi fans want! You would think that one or two good productions with some sense would creep through when the green light of this junk is on vacation. At least they employ Misfit Toys collection; Many of the sci-fi movies of the week actors were in science fiction shows once and now need cash. Love you people and hope you get some better work!
