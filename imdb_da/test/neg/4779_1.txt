I must say that this movie was not what I expected. Although I haven't read the book, the fact that plants can be a bait and then waiting for a killing is just happening to pull it off a corpse for lunch, about the worst scenario someone has come to with. With the title of the ruins you would believe it out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or old animal or god would be the culprit. It's like another movie where you think it was something strange that villagers fear most, but not a crocodile. No matter how this film was, it lures you to think of the ruins of Maya or Inca folklore, resulting in the awakening and the old god, or the people had a different agenda for victims or something like that. But plants? .... come on, is there no other producer can wow a crowd? With regard to this movie, it will hit the "b" list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore were excellent to watch, but it didn't matter to the rest of the movie. And a plant that mimics a sound or people's voices is just too much to be believed. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereotypical fan that relies on just doing or mechanical effects. I trust great excitement and what is the next scene that will bring more excitement. The case had a better story than it did. Even the ring made me jump for more, but the ruins are just that ..... ruined to use a plant for coax victims to kill or be killed by the villagers. The premise was okay for the villagers to keep it in the bay with salt and such, but still a simple squid and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those annoying plants with a carnal eating disorder.
