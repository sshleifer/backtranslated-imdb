Most critics have written devastatingly for the Michalkov movie, but I wanted it to see myself. And unfortunately they are right. The film had the biggest budget ever in Russian film history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot pretty close to the Kremlin - but at last it seems to be a nice, sweet nothing. You would not believe that this director has previously made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the story are not convincing, either Jane or McCracken or Andrej. Only General Radlov worth mentioning. It stays on the surface all the time. Politically, it is to me a glorification of the army and especially the Russian with values ​​as honor and duty. And having lived at least half a year in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one depicted in Michalkov's film. As for "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director as a no-question-10-point movie, one of the best I've ever seen in my entire life, I was totally disappointed with one. Pardon. Nevertheless, Michalkov's unique talent in delivering stunningly beautiful images is still there.
