I usually like these stupid / no brain activity movies, but it was just too stupid. There were too many clich√©s, and the plot did not really make sense. There were many loose ends and the end was extremely poor and abrupt. We didn't even see if the big master plan worked. We only got to see the protagonist sob over his death anymore, the professor (who died due to stupidity (see below)). One scene particularly annoyed me. Why did the professor only have approx. 5 minutes oxygen in his container when he went manually to exceed the pond? And if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why didn't he take two or three of them? Then he would have survived ?? it was bloody stupid. The movie is quite full of such stupid things. I can't recommend it at all.
