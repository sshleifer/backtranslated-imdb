Herman has made the Northern Drama with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falls into this ropey, flat and constructed tale of two teenagers trying to get season tickets to see Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Truancy, underage smoking and drinking, underage sex, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, drug abuse, depression, child violence, child crimes, shoplifting, housebreaking, car theft, violent assault and armed robbery all prominent here. None of these issues are explored, they only serve to move the story from one unhappy situation to another. The film is not as acute as Trainspotting, as exciting as The Full Monty, or as reflective of the time as Wonderland (from which it shamelessly steals the music in an overly manipulative way). I suppose none of the filmmakers are from Newcastle, and certainly have never experienced the social problems of the film references. I'm all for entertainment, and Hermans track record shows he's aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears. He simply comes up incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good ending, but there are too many flat, banal moments to get through to get there. Beautiful shot, not very well acted, and ultimately fails on three crucial points: script, script, script.
