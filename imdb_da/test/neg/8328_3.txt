"Tragic Hero" is a film that definitely tries to imitate the classic godfather movies focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. Also this is part of a two-part series that The Godfather was (at the time). However, this movie does not come close to the level of classic movies and actual fairs that are worse than other Triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at that time. One of the reasons is the actor. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the play is generally over the top and incredible. The audience tends to find the case humorous, simply because the actors' inability to maintain some degree of seriousness. As a result, we find the film not really emotionally involved or intense, as we are not particularly aware of what is happening to these characters. Another reason is its lack of focus. The story tries to incorporate many different story elements into the movie, but it results in parts of the film becoming underdeveloped and lacking a real sense of coherence. The audience is sometimes lost in the case we see without knowing what the character's motivations are. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax contains a decent gun battle, but again, as we don't care about the characters, we don't care who lives or dies; The scene loses its intensity and excitement because of this. The other action-set pieces are rather terrestrial in nature, with the feeling that it is too controlled rather than free-flowing. Generally this is a strictly transparent movie and not recommended for the general movie viewer ... Only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of Chow Yun Fat should consider this movie for viewing.
