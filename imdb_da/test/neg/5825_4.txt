I don't understand the many good reviews here. I found the photography and the scene beautiful, and the two main actors appeal, but there is little else here to recommend this movie. Most annoying are the fake southern accents and poorly written dialogue. These do not sound like real people to me. While it is refreshing to show men exploring different forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical characteristics, most of the story is without motivation or logic. The only thing that makes much sense is the responsibility Griffith feels for his mentally ill aunt who is grossly handled by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more convincing if the dialogue he was made to speak was more natural and his motivations clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a driver, but his actions as the movie draws to a hasty conclusion do not make any sense at all. This movie is worth a visit, mainly because it has a good atmosphere about it, but it goes slowly and deeply flawlessly. A serious rewriting and better editing may have saved it, as the premise and history are promising.
