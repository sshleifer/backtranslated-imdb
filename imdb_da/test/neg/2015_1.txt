Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that comes to mind after seeing this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I have so many bad movies in my life, but after seeing this, I only had two questions: 1) Is this just a spoof <br /> <br / > 2) How could people create such a thing? <br /> <br /> If you never saw this "movie" than you really don't know what's a really bad "movie". I mean bad. Scripture - Do you scour me? Action is so horrible that I do the "actors" where just have fun in this movie. I know this is "B" movie, but come on? Is this a reason to be such a garbage? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an end !!! A must miss! Just when you do things that this is the worst you've ever seen, wait until the end - because the kind of end you've never seen before (and I hope you'll never see). <br /> <br /> Experience this "movie" at all costs and don't say I don't warn you ...
