I couldn't believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors appearing in this grim action that should never be done. The plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (first I thought it was a spoof), and the play was spooky. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the fake scenery, a bunch of paintings magnified. Each filmmaker struggles to get their vision realized, but this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it our TV, with 3 Oscar winners making appearance. I can only guess everyone involved somehow hurt the author and the director and was forced (perhaps in gunpoint) to steal in this worthless T.V. garbage can.
