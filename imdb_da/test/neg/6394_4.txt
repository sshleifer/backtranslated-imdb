I saw this in the theater a couple of decades ago, and the fuzzy recollection suggests I liked it. But for another time, it looks two things: (1) very bad acts by Michelle Johnson, and (2) very bad music all the way through. It's not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was fine, but the theme song and others who sounded like it reminded of the worst 80's pop music. Johnson's voice seemed all wrong, possibly dubbed. This was distracting. On the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) It is interesting to see such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better, and (4) Johnson looked quite downloading at various stages of disattire .
