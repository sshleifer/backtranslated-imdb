DeCoteau must be one of the worst "directors" working today in any genre, and it has nothing to do with his films, which usually contain homoerotism and have the guys around in their matching boxer underwear. Remember ... everybody in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and will suck your blood / soul ... such deep symbolism here). I sat right through The Sisterhood to give him his fair shakes, I try to see all the horror movies I can and one had Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I had previously sucked into DeCoteau thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses I like). <br /> <br /> Lemme tells you what about The Sisterhood ... As the other reviewer pointed out, the putative plot involves lesbian vampires on a university campus. But never have a parade of hot young babes ("actresses" if you will) run around wearing bras, panties and bikinis have been so boring. The film has no plot, no one does, no nudity and the dialogue is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go together. Parts are put in slow motion and repeated many times to push the maturity up. About ten minutes of this consists of signs that just walk around the campus (oh, the excitement!) That looks more like a hotel resort than any college I've ever been to. And the play is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well leans forward and bends to show their bodies. The castrator was so devoid of talent that I would be shocked to see that some of them got a one-day go-ahead on Passions in the future. It's for the boys. Yes DeCoteau pushed more hot guys in underwear in this too ... Guys, who should be in some K-Mart brochures instead of trying to act. Should these people actually audition or just show up in Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. I am willing to give any movie a chance if 1.) it is intelligently written, well directed, original and competently acted (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). . Or 2.) It's shocking with gore, nudity, assorted trashiness and / or it's unintentional fun. David DeCoteau's movie delivers NONE from it, and they do it better than usual direct-to-video flicks. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the emergence of porn of the soft and hard-core variety that is easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I simply can't answer that. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to put a unique spin on the genre. Instead, he produces mindless drive without an ounce of talent or intelligence shining through. Ironically, when you think about it, his film is something but pro-gay. They actually make homosexuality seem seedy, secret and eerie. The overtly gay characters in his film always try to corrupt, seduce and / or kill the innocent, sexually confused leads. There is no shadow here to make things interesting. The main characters are naive and rarely turn out to be strong, confident or confident in who they are. I would understand this plot if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura starts making direct movie horror movies, but from a gay director, it just shows that he hardly thinks of these beefcake cheese plagues.
