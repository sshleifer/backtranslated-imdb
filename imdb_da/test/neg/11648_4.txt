The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> The special effects were not. <br /> <br /> It wasn't really good. <br /> <br /> Like others, I felt that there were many gaps in the plot that you could fly, yes, a space shuttle through. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending was pretty incredible. <br /> <br /> By the way, guys, "blow in the room". <br /> <br /> Ink lamps have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "oxy-acetylene burner"). Two snakes run from the burner: one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle. So an "ink lamp" would work fine in the room.
