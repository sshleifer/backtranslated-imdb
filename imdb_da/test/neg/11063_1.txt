This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Equal to Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flashing helmet lights made it difficult to see, and I think epileptics should be alert as there are moments of strobing that make this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been quieter, they could have found a way out. So when you think that the geek can get up in the trump itself, he estimates a nervous breakdown. Oh, when is the guy who has sex, aware that when the girl says she can hear something. She can really hear something. One of these guys must have seen Scream (where they pay attention to such things). It's also a big disappointment when a premise gives so much promise, and then someone writes the script. So excuse people, I got it every week in the video store and I still want my money back.
