This is a horrible movie that can hardly be recognized from the book, even if they have a similar plot. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better spent doing something else, including watching grass grow. The addition of poorly finished fantasy scenes makes Catherine seemingly stupid. The actor who plays Catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when she should look lovingly into her Tilney eyes. Frankly speaking!! The movie ends with a fantasy-like scene in Catherine, where you can't wonder if it's happened or if she's just mad, and not in the good way that makes you think, but in a horrible way. That basically sums up the horrible movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title written by Mrs Austen herself. I generally love the BBC's productions, but this one is horrible.
