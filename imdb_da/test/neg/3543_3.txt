Nightscream is a television movie so it's bound to be pretty grim, especially as it's a suspected horror movie. This young girl is haunted by dreams when she comes in a small town where there was a murder of a woman a year before. She's amazed when everyone in town thinks she looks like the murdered girl. The cities are astounded when she continues to enter dreams as trances, revealing precise details of the murder and the murderer, because police apparently got it wrong. Thinking they are in danger of being found out that the killers (there are two of them) are starting to close a plan to get rid of her before she comes to the real truth. At this point, you will probably fall asleep, and why have the film's decision makers 'full-dew-making' machine in the dream sequences.
