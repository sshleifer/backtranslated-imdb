I only comment on very good movies and on complete nonsense. My goal is to help people who want to watch good movies spend their time - and money - wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to stop people wasting their time on waste and would like to point out that the Director / Producer of these garbage films cannot get away with it for a very long time. We will find out who you are and will vote with out feet and wallets. <br /> <br /> This movie clearly falls into the waste category. <br /> <br /> The director and author are John Shiban. It is always a bad sign when the author is also director. Maybe he wants two salary checks. He shouldn't get anything. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see something else about him, forget it. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say anything about the plot - others already have. I'm a little worried about how much the director likes to zoom in on the poor girl's face as she cries and screams. These long-lasting shots are a little worrying and can say something about Mr. Shiban. Maybe he should get psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Already already. It's bad - don't play your time on it.
