The use of the term 'comedy' in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and worse is the pain inflicted on viewers of this production. Almost nothing was fun. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of stand-up 'comics' along the way as they travel from city to city to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and behavior from the stage and on stage cannot be distinguished, but unfortunately just as unfunny. It is possible to understand the self-righteous delusions that the selected "comedians" possess, but it is more difficult to understand the sound of laughter heard from their audience. Perhas these are the same target groups for whom the lame sitcoms on TV are calculated. <br /> <br /> This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my 50+ movie show.
