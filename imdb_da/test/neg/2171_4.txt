Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment to me. I had heard how great it was, how important it was. It just didn't hit me. It had a dim line of history, along with some moronic and sadistic Native American characters who are fiercely offensive to today's standards. While most of D.W. Griffith's film has depth and intelligence, this feels more like a formal-baised program picture. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in the birth of a nation's role plus some of the scene of the battle scenes were pretty good. According to the upcoming Griffith cameraman Karl Brown, the audience stood in their seats and cheered when the cavalry came in the riding at the end. I felt nothing. And besiege me, I see Griffith's early work on biography. This movie is just not what it used to be. The best thing about this movie is that, for all it's missing, many Griffiths touch it. He handles his main players pretty well, plus the stage where the Indians surround the cabin, it is reminiscent of the climate system Born of a Nation, a much better movie that would send shock waves across America just over a year later.
