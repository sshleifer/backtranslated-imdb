Well as the headline suggests this is not the very good movie I hoped it would be. I thought it would be nice with Mr Monty man himself, but not tragically. From the beginning, I literally lost interest immediately when 2 women just make tea, and suddenly she points out that there is random water coming from under the door, so the bam is full of flooding through the route in the house, it's hard to believe that they Didn't 'Note the rising water level outside or at least heard it. Sorry this sounds like a rant, but it really laughs my gear and has affected me. Most trades were poor, and history tried to copy almost all clich√©s to every disaster movie ever, but just failed in that sense. CGI was poor, I could do a better job of using ms paint, managing poor too, and at the end I didn't care for 1 sign at all !!! Don't waste your time people no wonder it was released directly to DVD. Thank you for reading xxx
