Retro puppet master begins in Kolewige in 1944, when puppet master Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his live dolls plan to escape Germany, quit an in-door doormate Toulon recalls his early life and the point where he learned the secret of giving life to death objects in 1902 in Paris when his younger self (Greg Sestero) ran Theater Magique. He describes the fateful night when he met a 3000-year-old Egyptian magician named Afzel (Jack Donner) and the final love to greet life, the young and beautiful Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). He tells the story of how Afzel passed the gift of life to himself and gave life to his own wooden dolls that were part of the Teater Magique show. But the gift of life was also a curse as the old God Sutek, whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by Afzel wants it back and everyone who has learned the dead ... As of late I have been a bit of a puppet master bender as a big fan of the first three I decided to see the rest of the franchise & as such I have seen Puppet Master 4 (1993), puppet master 5: The final chapter (1994), the puppet master's curse (1998) and now the retro doll star during a couple of weeks and boy it was hard to get through all of them, especially this as it is worse of the series so far. Retro puppet master feels like a cross between puppet master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) with his time setting and puppet master 4 & puppet master 5: The final chapter with Sutek is trying to kill anyone connected with his stolen life-giving secret. Nor is there much continuity here again, nor is there any of the green serum mentioned in the previous films, and although Andre Toulon commits suicide in 1939 at the start of the original Puppetmaster (1989) he is seen alive and well in 1944 in this. The majority of the story is told as a feedback and concentrates on Andre Toulon himself instead of the puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa & he learns the secret of life and it is all rather boring and boring things to be honest. Even in just 80 odd minutes, Retro Puppet Master feels long and padded at no real pace and no central concept, since the plot never really settles down and generally jumps around a lot. Then, of course, it's the confusing decision to completely rebuild the puppets that I found incredible, why do decision makers take the basic thing that made the puppet movies so memorable and completely gone with it? The dolls are seen shortly early in the beginning and at the end, but otherwise we get these fragile, beautiful wooden caricatures that are not as close to them as their modern reworkings. It was never even explained why these puppets were used instead of those that all puppet fans have come to love, even though one suspects that Full Moon hoped to make another successor who dealt with the issue. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and a complete lack of our favorite dolls were not bad enough Full Month decided to go with a PG-13 rating to make the Retro Doll Star the only puppet film not rated 'R' in The United States (of course, other countries have their own movie rating systems), and therefore there is not a single drop of blood in the whole movie, the puppets do not kill anyone, there is no hard and no nudity either. This is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way. Besides the fact that the dolls themselves are rubbish, the special effect is also the west of the series, there is no stop film animation at all in this, no CGI computer effects (probably in 1999, CGI was cheap enough?) And all the effects are rigid rod puppet type effects. I think when you see a doll 'walk', the camera is always above the wait, so there is no need to show the legs, and of course there are some production assistants who just push the case together, it is so complex and known as Special effects get. The one positive thing Retro Dukketejmester is about to do is that it looks pretty good, the period production design, costumes and props are actually quite impressive, and it's a pretty nice movie to watch at times. Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania, which doubles quite nicely until the last century in Paris. The action here is horrible and perhaps the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Retro doll star is more or less the final puppet movie as the next. Puppet Theater: The Legacy (2004) basically edits movies from the previous seven films and it is a beautiful wild way to round out the series, which started so well with three excellent and distinctive little killer doll rugs. Don't bother with this, just look at one of the first three again and just remember the good times ... The killer dolls would return in the horrible spin-off flick Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys (2004).
