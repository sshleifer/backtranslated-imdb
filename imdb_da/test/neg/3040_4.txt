Simon West's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school experiences to a modern audience. Staring talented teen Camilla Belle when a Stanger Calls fails to even evoke a shocked or even surprised face. Bad attempts to scare the audience range from blurry coats that resemble people building up the tense music for a cat running out of shadows. The reason follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay a bill to her father via childcare. She is invited to work for the night at a river house, and thinks it's an easy way to make money. But little, she knows, a stranger in the house and harrier Johnson always over the phone. A pathetic excuse for a movie.
