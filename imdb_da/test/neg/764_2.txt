My God, the things that passed for entertainment in this country ... This is * not * the "Tom and Jerry" you may have had on Saturday morning, with a fun cat and a smart mouse. This is a very earlier animation series featuring a few Mutt-and-Jeff clones that get themselves into different scrapers, resulting in some of the so-typical dance-skeleton-type gags that consist so much of early animation . /> <br /> This specially clever excursion that was originally intended as a vehicle for a couple of actual black stage comrades of the time, the couple has crashed into the sea as they fly to Africa, necessitating facial sensation, exaggerated "negro" dialect and "Feets, fail me now" situations. It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film, the American perception of Africans had not developed much. Then again, at least one of them apparently had a pilot certificate.
