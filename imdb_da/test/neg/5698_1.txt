It surprises me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this one. Really. Let us forget for a second that the plot does not even give a single hint of originality ... Most of the movies today are based on other movie stories, so a "simple" lack of originality is not such a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can hardly believe that none of the people involved in the movie ever came on a plane before shooting it. Because, let's be honest, it would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. To be sincere, I think a 6-year-old child with a false camera could have got something technically more credible. Some examples follow. <br /> <br /> The scene that really drove me wild is when the engine turns off when they regain control of the aircraft. When they turn them on again, the guy on the radio says something like "Ok, press the buttons 1 and 2 on the dashboard". Now it's not buttons. They should not be pushed, they must actually be pulled up and against the pilot. That's something fly-dependent would only know, you say? Wrong. Next scene you can see your fingers pushing the "buttons" ... And of course the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not even a millimeter! (And note that I haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines aren't like car engines, you just turn the key and the magic happens ... You have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on ...) Come on, boys! You could have faked the movements at least !! Not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashes on every thing along the runway (Light poles along the path? What do they think?) ... And the wings are not even ripped! It also happened to me, once ... Unless the plane was made by Lego! What about the air traffic controller? In fact, she is so knowledgeable that she knows exactly where "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. Should we mention the guy who can run an ambulance? Flying a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did he beat the other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could go on with these things for hours. This is the stupidest movie I've ever encountered and I include waste like Alone In The Dark and other things in the list. Do you want to do yourself a favor? Don't look at it.
