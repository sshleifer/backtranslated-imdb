A young man named Danny has run away from home and encounters a drive called Bix, who agrees to follow Danny and take care of him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's dining room. Bix begins to see Carrie, but he plans to go fast (because he is a driver, see? He's not good! Understand?). Meanwhile, the city creeps, Jesse (played by a perfectly cast Jack Elam), stops showing up at dinner and bothering Carrie. Danny keeps picking whores left and right (because he's loaded with money? He has almost a hundred dollars!) As Bix has to chase away all the time (there are many ambiguous gay overtones between Danny and Bix in this flick). Ultimately, Bix and Danny decide to leave town, but problems are a-brewing because of the Jesse creep. <br /> <br /> My review of the movie itself: A horrible, dated "Troubled Youth" flick from the 50s. <br /> <br /> My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I have to say this is one of the best episodes of MST3K ever. Riffing is dead, all the time. Apart from the somewhat scary ending, this movie is easy materials for Joel and Bots, especially Danny's constant screw top, which Bix must rescue him. The host segments are also quite good, especially the segment with `Train Song '. Hopefully, Rhino releases this episode for home video one day.
