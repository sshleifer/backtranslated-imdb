Franco movies can be divided into 4 categories - "earlies" (often black and white and inventive), "naughties" (late 1960s / early 1970s, often involving Soledad Miranda), "nudies" (of different periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drives) and "rest". <br /> <br /> This is part of the "rest". It's not a cannibal movie at all. It's definitely not gorefest. The few women in the picture do not even lose their linen covers, and there is little full frontal stuff at all. The picture quality of the German DVD I watched is poor. The movie runs out (to the extent it ever catches fire). As a Franco fan, I would tell others not to bother. Do something else with your time ... read a book .... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... something really ...
