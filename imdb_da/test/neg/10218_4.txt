This formal movie (hero's boyfriend marries the villain) just didn't go fast enough considering some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. He reacts faintly to the death of some of his hands; he escapes from Knox gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; His flight to the high country and the pursuit of John Russell seems superfluous, much like the movie. The reason could have been tightened. <br /> <br /> Highest points in the movie: see "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache song "Man in the saddle"; Alfonso Bedoya is too short scenes as a cook; color photography of the high country and the battle scene there with John Russell.
