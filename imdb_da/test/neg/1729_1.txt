This is a disaster film, in both meanings of the word. Every character, every role, every conversation, every twist, all in this movie stinks great time. It's a shame to see Dennis Hopper's talent wasted in this terrible movie. I can give you 100 examples, but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather, don't.
