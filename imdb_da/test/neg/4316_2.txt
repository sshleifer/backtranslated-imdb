About the spoiler warning? It does not "contain" it-contains-spoilers. Readers beware. Okay, first I need to be known that I don't base the actors. They just work with what they get. The problem was the script. It was awful. There was nothing credible about it at all. Well, when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, it will be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrible, cinematic situation. But these girls have just made stupid decisions after stupid decisions. The only girl who was smart enough to try to call the police was the girl added to the end because he had already killed one and beat another with a car. Talking about hitting her with a car ... why the hell did she try to run from a truck instead of driving as a normal person? Also, whoever wrote the scripture, honest with God, does the police not want to examine a door covered with blood? Frankly, it was not exciting either. The only excitement I felt was the frustration of where the pretty girls were. Well, this rant has gone much further than I thought for such a bad movie, so I won't bother to touch the end beyond the fact that it's unrealistic and lame.
