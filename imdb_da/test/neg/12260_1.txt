I do not understand why this movie was released, it looked like something you show your friends after you borrowed your mum handycam she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that if an Aussie movie made it to our store it may not be all wrong ... boy was i wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this movie, they either lie or filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the actor, oh the actor, that was the WORST performance in the FILM HISTORY. <br /> <br /> It makes me embarrassed and insulted that they used the word 'Aussie' in the title because I am proud to be Australian and this film is seen in other countries and can give people the wrong idea. /> <br /> Please read this and watch this movie, take the time to find other Aussie movies to watch because you could choose one of them and it would be better than the one. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better movie if I took a camera, filmed mine, but for an hour the movie waited for it to pass through my body and then threw what came out on the television ... no offense. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!
