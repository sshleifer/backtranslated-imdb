Why did they release this movie over us? It seems they are setting up to make this movie an overall hit on the surface of Anne Rice and any self-respecting Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the work done by Interview with the Vampire, muttering the plot of the novel, and stumbling around Stuart Townsend. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our abrupt prince, our adventurous rebel with the scary sense of humor. Stuart is another rate, boring rip off of Dracula in black leather. He did not read the books or know the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still has made a point of reading the books and knowing and loving Lestat. <br /> <br /> Not kids themselves, it's not a "Stand Alone" vampire flick that's rubbish bin simple and simple.
