Greyfriars Bobby was NOT a westie - Bobby was a shy terrier. A highlight of my childhood day trips to Edinburgh was going to the monument to Bobby. I grew up with the faithful and loyal little dog's story that every child of my generation did, and I remember preparing my mother outside the cinema - with many many other Dundee children and their mothers - to watch the wonderful Disney movie. How could a movie based on such a wonderful story be made using a Westie, for heaven's sake. It's like making a movie about Robert Burn's life, for example, and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, give Bobby back his race!
