If anyone thinks this is a good sports movie, it's probably the only sports movie they've ever seen. There are various aspects a sports film can take. Whether it's professional or college or high school. Examples of sports movies I liked (and I haven't seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All Americans, all the right moves, any given Sunday, eight men out and rocky, among others. All these movies had little more than just ordinary sports. Whether it was a man's ascent and then the descent from grandeur, or a man who lost on a dream by the actions of a vindictive trainer or the effect of money on professional sports. There is not much content in Hoosiers. It wasn't even as if the film had a beginning or an end. There was no sign development, everyone was forced on us. I could summarize this movie by quoting a very bad coach: "Go out and try to score more points than the other guy."
