This movie obviously has an agenda that can be summarized as this: Never, never cross the border (physical or metaphorical). Let's push everything that is on the other side with a wall or fence or something else, let's pretend that all "gringos" are evil, satanic or drug dealers. Anything beyond the borders of the country (and especially US borders) is dangerous, malicious, and people who want to hate you or envy or try to steal you or something else. "Based on true events" is just a perverted tag that can be pinned on something to give it an aura of credibility or in this case just to help push the film's ideology down some naive throats out there. The film's perversity lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everyone else in very black and white stereotypical categories: the Mexicans are in obnoxious people, the Mexican police into a bunch of corrupt police, the Republicans in right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so on. Is there anything good about the movie? I hardly think so, but maybe you think differently.
