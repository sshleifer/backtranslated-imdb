I loved the original P.H. and was somewhat pleased with bloodwings (II) and ashes for ashes (III), so I saw part IV. Oh boy ..... As a Pumpkinghead enthusiast, I did my best to give Part 4 as much credit as I could, but it's pretty bad. The wedding reception right at the start of the movie is a terrible mess for one thing. The history of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensible stupid and clich√©. How did the producers get away with the tired family feudal history? Wow, incredible. The action, besides Henrickson, is below average. The reason and script are mind-numbing. The actual editing and cinematography is average as it is indicative. I think the movie is not a total loss. As always: I really enjoy watching Pumpkinhead, I love watching Haggis the Witch, and like watching Harley's ghost in action. But all three characters had WAY too much screen time. I thought Haggis and Harley were going to close to a sacrament club for an evening bite to eat and drink, as they were so kind friends in her cabin. The bottom line is .... Is that what I wanted all the characters in this puke party of a plot line to be dead within 20 minutes after the start of the image. Where does Sci-Fi get these so-called "movie production people" from anyway! I could do a better job writing a script coal full. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything but come on! See it if you are a fan of the other three, but only once. And then go back and stick to the original two. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
