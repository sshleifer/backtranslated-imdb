Having seen all the episodes in the Star Trek TV series many times since the 1960s, where most are quite good at amazing and very few are mediocre, my opinion is that this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it's so badly executed to be a nuisance to the series. It's not that history is so bad, even though it's not particularly outstanding in any way, but the play is just scary on the two main characters, meaning the others than the fast in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her weakest performance ever as a daughter of a mass murderer, and who is on a mission of some sort. She calls virtually the role of a phone and shows no real emotional abilities here. Although she is usually never used as more than a beautiful face in most of her film / television roles, usually small parts, she has done much better. Arnold Moss as her father re-expresses the term 'Ham' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s Star Trek episode that exclaimed William Shatner in this area and actually makes Shatner a great experience. And he no longer gets to play a Shakespearian actress, giving him more incentive to overload, and he does. <br /> <br /> Other than these two leaders are so weak, the story is that anyone with any sense whatsoever can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot that ended at the first commercial break when we saw the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens. His answer was: Yes, you are right. <br /> <br /> Skip this and see the very superior Menagerie episodes that were originally twisted just before.
