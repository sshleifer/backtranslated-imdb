An object lesson on how to make a bad movie that masks like Horror. Without going too close, I can imagine that this is the result of a bunch of film school students who all add bit to the story and then actually work in it! It's like a movie workshop of some sort, and it's a movie that needs a lot of editors. In that case it would have been 10 minutes! The director of this waste probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of scripts submitted or even unpublished movies that would have benefited from this. The so-called Granny, who killed people in some rather stupid ways, resembled Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or perhaps the musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with a 20 minute throw boring nonsense burst out of the students - something about paranoia. Giving this rubbish 1 is because it can't get any less. It does not have a single redemption function - and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor is covered in blood, the guy is fooled that she should actually taste the red stuff before she does not know the tomato ketchup! It is an insult to an idiot's intelligence
