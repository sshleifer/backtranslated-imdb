I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie, at the end of it I took my hair out. This was one of the most pathetic films this year ... actually in the last ten years. David Dhawan should just give up his career as a director. I'm not yet crossing an original script that David Dhawan has been working on. This one was a complete bit y bit rip off Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just as miserable that it causes you to hate the original (which was pretty decent). I fail to understand which actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere that this should be Govinda's comeback vehicle. If that is true, then only God can save his career. Salman just overloaded the hilt. Govinda, who I think is a very high caliber actor, was completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do apart from wearing designer clothes and smiling without rhyme or reason. Please keep away from this form!
