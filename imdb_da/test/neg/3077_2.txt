Usually I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I saw the movie I was reviewing. With this I simply cannot explain. I had to be awake early for work the next day, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I didn't know about. But something kept me glued to my comfortable futon when I saw this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh, that's right. Bored Equality. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Joline, a bohemian distress case, which seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the man she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her hubby decides to find better things (work, women and script, presumably), Joline starts a fanatic mission to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair". It sounds like I'm doing this, but unfortunately I'm not. In fact, this is a little more than a play for Graham, as she gamely gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a workout. Oh and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also there for some reason. The TV shows had it as a comedy, but I couldn't find a single laugh anywhere. It struck me that this was a personal trip to Lisa Krueger (the director and author), in the same form as "Girl, Interrupted", but even that had more fun than this. Graham's character is simply too self-centered for the public to worry about, and I was upset by the chickenpox man when he bravely received his freedom from his clear mental wife. Very little of this movie was sensible, as characters just appeared in the story as if they were standing around waiting for Graham to appear as an extras in "The Truman Show". In fact, the only positive note I can produce from my scribblings is "Heather Graham - nice baps". And it wasn't because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. In truth, it is very hard to think of anyone to recommend this movie to. Graham purists (a very small number of overall movie-goers, I think you agree) will have to be obliged to see this dross and possibly hippy students gathering American Indian dreamers will take something out of this. I was amazed that the average rating (at the time of writing) was 5.0 - that would make this movie as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book, and that is simply not true. "Committed" is a quirky oddball mess on a movie that neither entertain nor enlightens. It's complicated, meaningless and simply too boring for my taste and probably yours too. Don't even think about this.
