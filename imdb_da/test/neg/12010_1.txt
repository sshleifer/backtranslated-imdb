Did the first travesty actually make money? This is another sequel (like another STAKEOUT) that no one asked for. But we have received it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, quite brain dead. It is also quite disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) Believing, I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Did they need the money so much?
