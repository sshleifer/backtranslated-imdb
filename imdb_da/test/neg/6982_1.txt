This movie was bad, but it was so bad that it could reach cult status in the distant future. A kind of film noir meets Plan 9 from outer space. The story was good, in fact there wasn't a story. There is a place reserved for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world, and this movie proves it. "So bad it can be good" is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt whether this movie will be downloaded by a legitimate distribution company and it is therefore unlikely to see a broad release. <br /> <br /> I would add that I expect to see more of actor Ron Carey. He made the best of what he had. The rest of the action, if I can call it that, was completely forgettable. I've seen worse from big studies with big budgets.
