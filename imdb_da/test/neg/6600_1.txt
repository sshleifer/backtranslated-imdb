I'm speechless, honestly I can't understand how anyone could have admitted a script like this, someone threw in the movie let alone lead it. The fact that I write this review feels like an insult to my fingers, this movie must be thrown into the trash bin rather than being reviewed. I am disappointed with Flex Alexander for even thinking of accepting such a bad challenge for a character even essay role. OMG! I think I just insulted the word "essay" ... uh yes I did. I know, the less said about this thoughtless drive, the better. You have been warned, no one warned me, I had to experience horror myself. Look at your own risk.
