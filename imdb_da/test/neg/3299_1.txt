I saw the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development," boy, was I disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly torn by "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with children" as they are all similar in plot and overall mood. The so-called "punch lines" are all repetitive and formal, even more so, the "punch lines" are not fun at all, for me they are more like crass and raw. The main character Dave Gold seems like a white trash can, which he thinks is fun and cool as he is. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said it in the "Gaza Strip" episode. In the episode "Dream Crusher", Hillary wanted to be a singer {but was actually pretty bad}, Dave and Vicky were happy to break her dreams by telling her she was sucking. Then she wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Vicky and leaving the room, the two thoughtless mockers began. Also in the first episode, Dave said about Hillary's {black} boyfriend "Does she actually think we'll let her go out with this guy? I'd rather drink my own urine," that line has the stupidest line in television history. And Dave constantly makes fun of Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek. Let's not forget, too, that he has made fun of Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father, he has to stand up for his son, no matter what. The "home war" is undoubtedly the worst television show for the family. It clearly explains why the show should be canceled as it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda. It's as if the show is going to be fun to always put up the silly laugh every time someone says something, but the lines are all a little forced, idiotic and pathetic young. Another reason why the show is terrible is the actor, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are horrible, horrible actors. Rappaport should always move his hands around when he is in front of the camera, he does not only do this show, but he did so in his time with "Boston Public". Sullivan speaks and seems like a kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in "Malcolm in the middle"). <br /> <br /> So to pack this whole thing up, you have all your reasons for what's wrong with this show 1.It's unoriginal 2.The acting sucks 3.It's not even fun 4. Alke jokes are the same 5.Has lousy script 6.The characters are pitiful and unlikely. 7.Papa is a rip-off of Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX should take this garbage out of the air because something is better than this.
