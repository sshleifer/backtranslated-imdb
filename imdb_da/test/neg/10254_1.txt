The way back at the beginning of human civilization set the cavemen around and made lame jokes, beating each other over with what they could grasp, and women were never seen and apparently at once had tails. These cave dwellers lived in a geographically diverse region with a kakadoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the "hilarious" misadventures of seven (or so) cavemen - having burned their country with the new discovery of fire - moving on with water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage. Along the way, we get such "big" moments of comedy as a fat cave that extinguishes a seed that stifles the stomach. A monkey throws stones at their heads. A man extinguishes a mouse to get the frog in the stomach. The obligatory "gay" caveman. The list could continue and continue. This film is the very definition of cinematical killing. I was sorry for the start and it only got worse when the cavalry bubbled around and hit each other and made bad jokes as pennants on the word leg, hit each other and met poor Seta Berger, who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to show up in this nonsense. She is actually one of two bright spots in this movie. She's not much of an actress, so you have to guess why she's an ass? The second "bright" place is the music. As soon as I heard the score, I told myself that it sounded very familiar. I had never heard the actual score, but the music was unmistakably that of Ennio Morricone. It is a good score and the best thing in an otherwise raw, boring, creepy, imaginative and ridiculous movie mainly about a group of Moes who found a woman for the first time and first wanted to eat her as an animal and was taught what she was can do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I smuggle a gap when I revive the plot! The end of the movie has about 100 or so mostly naked women on display with all the erotic feeling of pulling a scab off the knee. This movie was painful to sit through and gives nothing of any real profit. The fact that it created a sequel does not surprise me as it offers one thing that will spark the viewer interest - tail.
