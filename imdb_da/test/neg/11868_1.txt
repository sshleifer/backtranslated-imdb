At first glance I have to say already, see the contractor, 2007. with Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and a more dramatic plot. The detonator has a horrible plot focusing on a kind of atomic bomb set in Romania and with horrible rule for an action movie - there are no excitement moments and an action movie is turned to boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect Wesley Snipes to do when horrible screenplays like this are offered to him? Don't blame him for the money he needs. <br /> <br /> This was my first impression when I watched the movie, 3 years ago. But I won't see it again, no way. Screw it. It stinks. There. I said it. <br /> <br /> PS: I don't think I ever said "this movie stinks" on an IMDb review. Thanks detonator!
