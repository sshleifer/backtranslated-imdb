Well I watched this movie during the last San Sebastian Film Festival. The reaction to it was ... let's say as funny as the movie is unintentional. It happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They seemed to be a Chinese translation into English and then to Spanish. It was all confusing, the sexes changed (girls seemed like boys and boys as girls), and my friends and I remember big lines ... but because they were so absurd. All in all, not a good movie, but if they ever show it on TV and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh (again not so much with the movie) then move on, "Visible Secret" is your movie.
