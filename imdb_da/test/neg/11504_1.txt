When I first saw this show, I thought of myself "What is this !!!!!?" Its one of them shows where there is a perfectly fake high school with stupid problems that are considered "huge". Then there is sadness. This complete misfit for her friends and well her family. Shes is completely obsessed with nature, not that is a bad thing, but she compares high school students with animals! Like what is it? also they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone (yes because the world absolutely needs another one of them!) Shes also very perfect as most tv girls are who make me sick! So please this is a stupid show, it makes no sense to just skip it unless you liked Lizzie McGuire or other shows as such.
