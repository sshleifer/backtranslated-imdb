What a terrible misfire. Not only the title, but the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, George Segal's vehicle a few decades ago. Why? I wonder that someone with Jim Carrey's complaint will not only star but also produce this tired, ugly, meaningless excuse for a comedy. He could take comedy to a whole new level, but he instead of what he must assume is safe area. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this unpleasant mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that was how I felt. Aware as I was of the desperate attempts tried on the screen to be fun. And failing. It could have been a monstrous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the Enron Days entry, but no, it would prove too high, too risky. What a shame!
