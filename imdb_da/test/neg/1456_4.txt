Have you ever tried some kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "Wow, it wasn't a good mix"? That's how I felt after watching this movie. Many viewers will be left very uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very, very majestic comedy. It's almost like seeing Mr Rogers playing a ruthless gangster, very strange. Some things just don't interfere and this movie clearly shows it. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but it doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme has done some outstanding work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but seems to be out of his element with this.
