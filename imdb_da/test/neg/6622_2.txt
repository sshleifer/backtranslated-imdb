carrot top in a full-length movie, said enough. the only reason this doesn't get one is through my personal voting system with only a 1 and a 10, and it's no extreme setup. horrible god horrible. There are some movies that are so bad that they are inadvertently fun, so there are movies that make you physically unlucky, and then there are those who are serious about suicide. burn all copies of the film, shoot anyone who has no creative input on this movie, torture anyone with creative input, and as for the star, there are only so many things that can be said online, but he must beg for the final Ti seconds of existence with a cut off head when work is completed.
