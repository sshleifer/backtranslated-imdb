Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's better post Stagecoach films. It's good in spots, has some nice action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood by climax. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have in Tycoon is two men who do not like each other, and it contradicts preventing them from working as a team. Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke has hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the necessary means to do the job properly. Things become very complicated when Wayne falls for Hardwick's daughter, Laraine Day. After a night of spending time alone in an Inca ruin, after convention in South America, Wayne and Day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing has happened. What should have happened, these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to make their differences somehow. Their petty point causes some deaths among Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But what Tycoon is best known for is another piece of flexibility. Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher, head of Brooklyn Dodgers when this was filmed. He was a constant presence on the set, crazy jealousy by John Wayne, whom he believed could have an affair with his wife. Nothing to it, but he made his wife's life miserable. <br /> <br /> Not one of the duke's better efforts.
