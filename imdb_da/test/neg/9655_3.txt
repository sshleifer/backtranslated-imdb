This movie is definitely a weird to say the least. The basic plot is 3 old business associates inviting 2 strangers to their home to return a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it. The two coming up will fall in love. The 3 older businessmen die and come back as ghosts to try to help out the two younger guests. Okay, it might make sense, but then we have 3 old guys who seem to have some bread that lives together .. a little weird here ... Harry Carey plays his part off the base, you can't tell if he's a good guy or really a punter. I really mean, do it well, I can handle it. Then there's Richard Carlson, who plays James Houston from Texas .... hmmmmm, he sounds much more like a southern gentleman from Kentucky than one from Texas. This one is not even close .. Then we take the 3 ghosts that would have a better chance of helping New Orleans Saints win a game from outside than actually helping ... In fact, they are really no help at all and why they Being even in the movie is beyond any scope of knowledge. Silly movies, where a cast of characters works out of character. You can avoid this ..
