I'm lost to words. This movie is beyond the description. I don't think there is a language on earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this movie is. If you are trying to see it, be sure to stick to the "surprise ending". I only made about three-quarters of the way through this piece of shit before I couldn't take it anymore. Fortunately (or unfortunately) a couple of my friends stayed at the end. When they woke from their coma and after a couple of weeks of treatment they could fill me in what I had missed. This movie has no story, no plot, horrible writing and even worse acting. If you enjoy watching train wrecks or car accidents, then this movie is for you. I think my IQ dropped about 30 points from seeing this (insert explicitly here).
