I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this movie has just left me cold. I expect another American in Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I was expecting too much. The movie was short on songs and maps of impressive dance tracks. I was impressed by the very expressionist Kelly dance as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown, too bad the song was so annoying. I also enjoyed Judy striker Kelly with bric-a-brac. See Lorna Air's autobiography for some interesting information about that scene. In fact, the movie has what should be some of Cole Porter's most annoying songs, especially "Nina". Also Judy and Gene are constantly shouting as screechy children. The plot is thin - which is par for the course for musicals - but it is not saved by impressive dance figures or by memorable songs. I suppose the best parts of this movie were left on the floor. Please, some movie updates, find these movies and show us what the movie might have been!
