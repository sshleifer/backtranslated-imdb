Begrudgingly gave it a 3-point point each for Fonda, Stanwyck and the supporting spirit. <br /> <br /> Never seen this before - I see it right now, and it has just come to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs across the threshold. If I continue to see, it will only be if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to pull this out of the dump. <br /> <br /> But after reading the other viewer comments, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The open ski photos were enough to ward off my lunch. Of course, the voice overview was done in a sound study, and editing between the outer shots and the close-ups was terrible. I don't know much about the technology of that era - but I can't believe there was nothing they could do to make it more credible. <br /> <br /> My second gasp of disbelief was when Fonda dried out and (I imagine because of the extreme speed of the journey), he is burrowed first in the snow up to his torso - Stanwyck pulls him out Obvious staged difficulties - and (I imagine, because she is such an experienced physician) does not respond at all to his seemingly unconscious state and lax attitude. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm completely capable of suspending my disbelief, but I couldn't overcome the fact that she had just jostled a man with a possible head injury and that he could be paralyzed for life. Not my idea of ​​great yuks. So when I finish this comment, we have just seen Church's first jealousy, and Dr. Hunt is out performing an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate anymore - the script, the background music or the story !! Argghhhh! I'm done. Play over. Click.
