This is in itself an above average movie, but why was it made in Book's name? It is impossible to treat it as a thing for itself, because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic from 1960. You can't see it without the 1960s showing up in your consciousness . <br /> <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his fellow players with anything other than deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets and colors? Anne Heche is attractive, but lacks Janet Leigh's firm determination to become a respectable middle-class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought to his fruitless attempt to marry and settle down, a woman's desperation for forty. And Heche does not induce anxiety that Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer in his car window shows the weakness of the role. In the original, the officer asks: "Is there anything wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not. Should I act as if something was wrong?" The officer hesitates to answer: "Yes, honestly, yes." This exchange has been left out of remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. The worst change is without a doubt the replacement of Vince Vaughn with Anthony Perkins. It can't be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Perkins are migratory, bird-like, long-necked, dressed in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum. His every move (eating candy corn, with his Adam's apple bobbing) and any utterance, the weak grin, the dry chuckle, is spot on. He just can't improve. Vaughn brings the role of the presence of a short-haired carnal guy who was just discharged as a Lance Corporal from the US Army. To suggest his psychosis all he can do is overlay a maniacal giggle on top of what otherwise looks like a normal norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn didn't even stumble upon the word "bug" because it resembles "phallus.") He could just hang around at the motel and waited to hear about his application for a football scholarship to UCLA. <Br /> <br /> The direction deserves a few comments. I can't see what it adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while looking at Anne Heche. I have nothing against it. I wonder why it is there, just as I ask myself why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> And I assume to impress how much color adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's more subtle stuff. Heche gives underwear of all different colors - green, pink, orange and - mango? Is it a color? If so, what goodbye is that? Forget it. The point is that in the original, when the travel camera first looks through the window of the Phoenix hotel, it captures Janet Leigh in the bed wearing a pure white half-slider and a white bra. Later, after she has stolen the money, we see her in her underwear again - this time both her slip and bra are black. It's a small thing, but Hitch's own. <br /> <br /> Thus, the idea of ​​shooting in color may not have been bad, except that the black and white recording of the original was amazing. The color and strange light effects in this version make the ordinary, boring and subliminally vicious motel something like that it belongs to the seedier part of Las Vegas. Most of all, the 1960 movie was shocking in more ways than one. I remember seeing it in a driveway in San Diego and staring confused on the screen as it became clear that the central character was actually dead - halfway through the movie! Nothing like it had ever happened before. <br /> <br /> The murder in the shower of both films was a major improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, incidentally, where the author writes something like "The murderer came into the bathroom and cut off his head with a knife." up. Well, not quite. Even here, Van Sants film gives us profits. There is more blood and harder meat. And when Hitchcock first closed the blood, circling the bathtub and dissolving himself to Marian's shiny open eye, the camera slowly pulled back to reveal the face, rotating his camera from a small tilt to the right vertical, giving the viewer a sensible feeling not just disbelief in the murder, but a staggering disbelief. Van Sant does not assign the camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees that Hitchcock did. He almost forces it on his axis. It won't do to call this a bow to Hitchcock because it's not. It is an economic looting of Hitchcock's material (already torn in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV, and "Psycho: The Beginning Years" and "Getting into my Parlor: Mrs Bates' Revenge" and "Hand Me That Knife , would you?: The TRUE story of Norman Bates. ") A rehashing of and grinding away in truly original things, a curly act, if not a criminal. And that's not to mention the many greetings in other movies, especially the French, as the infamous "sea of ​​boredom" scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the much admired "La Mere de la Nuit." (Perhaps I would like to add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And when a chicken's plaster strikes grain, it is a "crumbling" act. I don't want to continue to say those gags, shabby as they are, are more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> So who was it made for? I should guess. Kids who are too young to know about the original and who do not like movies in black and white? Children who hope to see another plain slasher movie? Chimpanzees?
