I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 because it sounded interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea that someone pulled a skeleton) because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt at the back and because there was a limited display of sticker on it. I thought it would be a sweet or at least sincere upcoming age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I have to wonder how it became the limited sticker, as there is almost no wrong language, little violence and the closest thing to nudity (honestly, don't usually go Around and hoping for it!) is when the girl is in nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because it doesn't matter what she's on a mini-shirt of some kind). Even the anti-religious humor is pretty (and lame, caricatured, uninhibited, derived, unoriginal and worst of all not fun at least - it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' "Would Jesus wear a Rolex on his TV show "). This would hardly qualify as PG-13 (it's not rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent it - as if it were pornographic. Any little kid could go in and rent the edited version of Requiem for a dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It's, but not that way. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I worry - the only thing that can offend people is the idea of ​​suicide at first. If anyone needs to watch movies with honestly portraying suicide (not the one but better as The Virgin Suicides), it's teenagers. If both films were rated R only because of the suicide aspect, I have a little chance of getting a story I have written for a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three major causes of death in teenagers (I think it is number 2), so chances are that most teenagers have been or will be affected by it. <br /> <br /> Just say no to this movie, though. 10.2.
