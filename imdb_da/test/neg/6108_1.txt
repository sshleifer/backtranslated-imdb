As a writer and a killed orthodox Jewish woman, I was hugely disappointed by this movie. The dialogue is hackneyed and wasted, the signs that are engaged to lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the astonishingly melodramatic, must not be extended to true textured individuals. The one-tricks musical point tries to make up for the humor, swooping clearly into the silence to beat the viewer and the script out of long-lasting catatony. As a youth revolutionary on a self-righteous tirade, this film is blown away by the revelation of wisdom - the patriarchy is wrong - and thoroughly disappears its energies and hammers at this point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; The moral crime is the reduction of people to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.
