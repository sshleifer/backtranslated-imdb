Comparing this movie with something of Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about it is desperately trying to be like an Almodovar movie and failing. The scripture is horrible, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performance is the quality of high school drama (except Marcia Gay Harden, which is pretty good considering the material she has to work with). In addition, the cinematography does nothing to convey the imaginative beauty of Gaudi's architecture or the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you enjoy gravel, pathos and dark, quirky comedy of Almodovar's movie, you will find none of them here. Use your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.
