There is somewhere here that makes it a decent, routine SF story. It is counteracted by several factors. First, the actor is just horrible. Even the competent actors are terrible. The dialogue is wood and stylized. The plot goes together predictably. This seems less like a finished movie than actors go through. Extremely disappointing.
