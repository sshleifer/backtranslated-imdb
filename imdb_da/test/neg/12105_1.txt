Almost a master class in how not to lead a movie. From the wronged, often unimaginable script in the future, Dr. Rey on a number of bad decisions that make the movie an eerie experience. Unfortunately, the film never rises beyond a kind of old-fashioned, almost misogynistic, homosexual camp, where women are exaggerated, OTT and the Middle Ages, and the men are young, vacuumy and forever in search of sex. The director was unable to pitch either the tone of the movie or the level of the performance. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a lot of 'acting' going on. Dianne Wiest slides into a pale imitation of her Bullet's Over Broadway performance and bad old Jane Birkin flounders in her attempt to give a comical performance. Although you have to be ashamed of her, there is very little real comedy here. It all feels like a very low rental version of the merchant's ivory Le Divorce, which, to be quite honest, was not very good either.
