The action was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like they had just received the manuscript in the morning) and the movie and sound quality made me think of the 70's movie in the weekly bombs. The only thing that told me that it wasn't actually a 70's movie this week was the reference for DNA testing. But for me, being Eastern Orthodox, was the most egregious thing about this .... movie ..... the total romishness of religion. Romania is 88% orthodox, but you will never know from this movie: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known this even though I hadn't seen the actor playing the Irish pub holding Michael Sullivan in Star Trek: Voyager's "Fairhaven" episodes. The bishop had Roman garments (and for the plate there are not even orthodox bishops who wear their garments unless they say the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). About the only non-Roman appliances I saw were the 3-bar cross at the door of the church, and even then I had to see it. The first reviewer said the producers had done their research. Well, if that's true, they broke up on the religious aspect of the movie.
