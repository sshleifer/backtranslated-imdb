As a serious marathon, I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or novice marathon. After the stories of 2 first marathons, a senior, a wounded runner and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago Marathon, the film dedicates most of its attention to a female beginner whose story is because there is a better word, boring. While I enjoy the brief glimpse of Deena Kastor's training sessions, the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathon in general, let me emphasize: These were short !! Watching some Joe Runners prepare for a Saturday ride with their water bottles and talk about how they see the marathon is not inspiring, and the nonstop performance and emotional grinning runners will make you wish the movie was about an hour shorter . If you're a marathon for the first time, this movie can give you a sense of "I can do it." For someone else, run away.
