I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the cast, I thought it was well-acted. I especially enjoyed Ellen DeGenere's perfect killed performance. What didn't work for me was: (1) the drawn affair with the younger man (too long, for apparently out of character for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless biographical clich√©s, most visual, but also interminable voted over readings of the love letter itself (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young woman's feminist teacher and, ironically, a fireworks scene (no wonder it reminded me of the horrid How to make an American Quilt movie); (4) the bumbling "gotcha" cop who smells "dope" everywhere (no cliche there either!); and (5) a nausea romanticized small town setting. I would have preferred the movie to more convincingly investigate the source of (or even glorified) Helen's bitterness, having included much more of DeGenere's character, having eliminated or reduced the various generations, and being slightly less uncritical for small-town life. <br /> <br /> If it had been developed as a game first, this criticism could have been addressed before committing the material to this movie, which unfortunately is mediocre.
