Ed Wood, perhaps the worst movie producer from all the time left us gems that are so bad, they are delighted to be inadvertently fun and therefore charming and innocent. James Lay and his financial supporters (mother and father, it looks from the credits) have created in 'Dreamland' a movie just as badly made as any Ed Wood movie, but lack any charm or innocence. Dreamland simply stinks, and if the only good thing about this 90-minute waste of time is the broad knowledge that James Lay and his fellows will never make a picture again. <br /> <br /> I have to mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture. I'm sure the production controller, after watching the finished film, demanded to have its name changed in the credits to 'Donna Snartlebutt' and the accounts made by 'Brutus'. You can imagine 'Brutus' with its $ 5 bill that pays the crew at the end of a shooting day. <br /> <br /> I will not mention the many technical issues with this pathetic little videotape, but I have to mention a few comments that compare this slag to the work of David Lynch. You know you've shown yourself a real stink when you have your mother logged into IMDb and posted such an amazing BS - no one, afraid of violent mental patients, could-always-fail 'dreamland' with - something produced by Lynch. What a terrible little to Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Go back to the film school, Mr Lay.
