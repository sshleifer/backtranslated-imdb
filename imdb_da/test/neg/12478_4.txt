Lucio Fulci, an instructor who is not quite famous for his subtlety, tries his hand at black humor in the Touch of Death, one made for television films about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho seducing and murdering rich widows for To pay his gambling debt. <br /> <br /> Beginning with a wonderful gory scene where the lethal lothario dispenses his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, Touch of Death starts promisingly, but Fulci soon loses control of procedures, introducing a oddly sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavily-handled 'comic' scenes. There are several graphical murders which, in true Fulci mode, are extremely violent and cruel, but even the high level of blood slipping does not prevent this from being one of Fulci's inferior efforts. As I have found with many of his other films, an understandable story is not quite high on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This movie has many peculiarities that left me more than a little confused: why did Lester not abduct all of his victims with the breakdown method in the beginning? Why are all his victims either hairy or disfigured? What the hell is it all about? <br /> <br /> Fulci is considered by many to be one of the "greats" of horror cinema; I do not understand his popularity and find the majority of his films, which I have seen so far, generally lack both decent stories and technical skill. The Touch of Death certainly does nothing to change my mind.
