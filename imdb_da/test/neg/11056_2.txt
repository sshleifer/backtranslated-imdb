Bottom-of-the-bar stinks are so bad, it's beyond fun. "Plot" is about an American mercenary played by Reb Brown (in the film he is called a "military adviser", but it is not clear whether he is in the US military or not) and helps the army with a Latin American international guerrillas. who wins up to the guerrillas when the government turns him on, prisons and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment saleswoman" he picks up in a bar caught throughout the plot. This description makes the movie file better than it is, because it really is a stink of almost biblical proportions. How bad is that? Well, Shannon Tweed stays in the movie's most professional play. If it is not an indication of what a 12th grade junk this turkey is, there is nothing from inconsistent sound effects to a music score that sounds like it is from a 1940's "Z" -grade horror flick (and can much well be) for the same recordings (ie armored personnel who go down the same jungle trail) reused constantly for some of the most eerie staged "action" scenes in the latest memory, this ridiculous slam festival should be seen as disbelieved. Tweed looks bored, brown looks hung over, and by that time this thing is done - if you can last that long; I couldn't - you just know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Though there are many explosions and weapons battles, this cannot be considered an "action" image of any part of the imagination. It's boring (there's a scene behind a truck where everyone just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repeatedly (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" are killed over and over again), illogical (when a group of rebels are trapped in an open area by a government helicopter gunship, instead of breaking for cover, they just go there and stare at it), inappropriate (soldiers and rebels who fall "dead" when no firearms are heard, a gun battle in a house where warriors facing walls are machine-damaged but miraculously avoid the walls undamaged) predictable (when the "governor" says to offer a reward for Brown's catch because "someone" can beat him in, you know exactly who it is "somebody" will be, and it turns out to be exactly what you thought it was) and just plain stupid (pretty much anything else in the picture). Unlucky, brainless and stupid beyond belief. Do not waste your time.
