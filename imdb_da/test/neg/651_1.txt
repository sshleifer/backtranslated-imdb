Little did I know when I signed up for the "All Payments" package with Direct TV that I wanted to watch a movie like this. It just happened after another movie we had seen ... and I was a teenager in 1981, so I'm not sure where I was at that time ... but I missed this movie. <br /> <br /> I also can't believe we left it. It's a little fun as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80's ... but I think it would have been a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "too sweet"! ET was "sweet" in a way ... but not uncomfortably sweet ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this ... I move on to IMDb to see what others are saying. I blown away that this thing was nominated! Wow ... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh yeah ... it showed some old actors ... btw that's the second I was surprised ... lineup ... not a bunch of no names ... but some real actors / actresses. Must have been in their medical days! Anyways ... odd, interesting, bizarre, and happy to grow up!
