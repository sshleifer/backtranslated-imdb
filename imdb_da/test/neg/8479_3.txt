This movie is not worth going to the theaters to see, I did and I did not like it, the effects on the movie are really well done and you get a laugh here and there, but the story is really bad it seemed they were over Dare for ideas and what is it that loki and odin come together? who completely destroys Norwegian mythology, and I guess they forgot that loki's powers only worked during the NIGHT !! If you really should watch this movie rent it when it comes out, don't go to the cinema for this! <br /> <br /> They could have done much more with this than they did, it felt like they just wanted to make a movie to show cool animation and effects
