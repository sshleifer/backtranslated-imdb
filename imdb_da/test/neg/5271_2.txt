Well, first and foremost, as many reviewers have pointed out, this is a rip off of the Martin Cahill story - first represented by the BBC and John Boorman movie "The General" - which is a great movie and far, far better than this one . <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native British person, Kevin Spacey's support model was really good compared to British and Irish actress talent, especially Peter Mullan - but it was totally wasted. The signs were c ** p! And as for Kevin Spacey - don't come across as a lovable villain, but as nothing really big or important. <br /> <br /> Not much to redeem this movie. The best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other movies it rips off. Compare notes on this movie and "The General" - I would be interested to see what others think. <br /> <br />
