I always saw Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's efforts as a producer with some suspicion, and these were only confirmed after my recent review of Lamberto Bava's terrible DEMONS (1985); The fact that this was to be its third installment does not sound promising at all, but I decided to rent the movie no matter where we are in full halloween swing. I checked out the theatrical trailer at Anchor Bay DVD before looking at the main feature ?? the unimaginable striking pictures had fascinated me to be sure, but then the right movie (which is not more sensible than what is presented in the frayed two-minute montage and in turn can be seen as having wisely composed most of the highlights ) Prove a certain relaxation! <br /> <br /> Opening promising enough with a medieval prologue right out of Alexander NEVSKY (1938), goes downhill quickly because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of the tale. Consequently, several characters randomly take the center throughout ?? With the unbearable male lead that gives in after the dark forces early, the outrageous bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) is a pure red herring, the mysterious black priest who gradually assumes heroic qualities, the leading lady is for some reason influenced by goat-shaped demon (culminating in a sexual rite performed in front of the other cultures lifted too overtly from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year-old Asian Argento as the rebellious but sympathetic sacristan daughter (who appears as survivor only end). Incidentally, Elder Argento also wrote the film's story and manuscript along with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym after they appeared with Dario in the early stages of production), original helmets Lamberto Bava and productive genre writer Dardano Sacchetti (who I met on the 61st The Venice Film Festival in 2004). <br /> <br /> The extremely confused second half of the movie then sees a group of people ?? including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering English couple (whose constant bickering is given an entertaining nasty punchline) ?? also closed inside a building in the grip of the evil spirit (the church is the burial ground of a satanic cult) not that this horror outing is likely to remove the memory of Luis Bunuel's sublime surrealistic EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) you see! In the end, the movie is the more disappointing (although Sergio Stivaletti's atrocious effects are at least remarkable), when I had thoroughly enjoyed the only other Soavi title I had seen? CEMETERY MAN (1994), which I own via R2 SE DVD. That said, I would still like to have his debut feature ?? STAGE FRIGHT (1987) ?? and the director's follow-up effort to the Church with the title THE SECT (1991) ...
