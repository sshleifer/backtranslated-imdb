Imagine a profound remake of Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set the story of some Caribbean islands where drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. And get the black woman from Huggy Bear's stable ladies, and the white woman is a water Patty Hearst and you have Black Mama, White Mama. <br /> <br /> In the declining days of the drive-in theater this element must have been a big old hit. All the fast buttons in the seventies are pushed into it. Although they both better fit their clothes and will get a few flutes from the men in the audience, nobody will ever make mistakes on Pam Grier and Margaret Markov for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. Okay, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and guards look very much at the new fish arriving. Margaret is a rich girl from the state who raised the 'revolution' while Pam is your basic high-price talk girl who has been servicing the local drug kingpin and was tired of it and tried to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's colleagues revolutionize the back of the bus and transport them from the woman's prison to the city, but they are lost in flight. Both have their different agendas, but like Sid and Tony they cannot quite agree on who the agenda comes first. Do some interesting times when the police, drug dealers and revolutionaries are all looking for these two bad chain comrades. <br /> <br /> Just so you don't get any wrong ideas, the revolutionary leader and Markov's canoeing partner is Ernesto, who is played by Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole mess was shot in the Philippines, who started their own film industry. Nice location photography in Phillipines is all that Black Mama, White Mam should recommend it. But if you're a fan of really bad black exploits, this is one for you.
