OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual easy delivery of lines in his movie. Age has helped him with his soft speech low energy style and he steals a scene effortlessly. But the disappearance is his fault. Holy Moly, it was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I have to give kudos to cinematography and the actors, including Kris, to try their darndest to make sense of this bleak, confusing story! None of that was sensible, and Kris probably didn't understand it, and he just went through the moves and hoped someone would come up to him and tell him what it was all about! <br /> <br /> I don't care that everyone on this movie was out of love for the project or any such nonsense ... I've seen low budget films that had a plot for the goodness of sake! This had no one, zilcho, nada, zippo, empty ground ... a complete waste of good talent, scenery and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this piece of garbage for a buck and I want my money back! I want my 2 hours back, I invested on this Grade F waste of my time! Don't watch this movie or play 1 minute of your valuable time as you go through a room where it plays or even opens the case holding the DVD! Trust me, you want to thank me for advice!
