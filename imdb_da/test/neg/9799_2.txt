Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he also credited as a production designer) phones his friend Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from South America, where he has studied Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) & that he was on a great story, but while still talking on the phone, he is stabbed in the back and killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, she is also executive produced), recently released from a mental institution, together discusses their grisly plans. The news of Cater's death has reached Casey and he decides to take up the story and investigate, and in fact he gets his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to do most of the investigation and just report back to him, lazy bugger. Virginia informs Casey that they have someone on the inside called Kristine (Heather Hughes) when Dr. Frederick rents her extra rooms to nurses, reports Kristine back to Casey about Schuman & Dr. Frederick's grotesque youth restoration experiment with human flesh and specially grown mole ... <br /> <br /> Co written, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a pretty bad movie on all accounts. First, let's start with the script by Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for the cinematography (you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job), it's basically terrible. The character is one-dimensional idiots and has no personality, I didn't like anyone in this movie. Because it is worth it, I like some of the ideas here, the meat-cutting stomachs, the basement laboratory, stealing bodies from a hospital and the unforgettable 'twist' that is almost worth sitting through the rest of the movie on its own . Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written, stiff and unnatural that it is untrue, I think there is a scene where a nurse says they "will not let us out of the house," which is fine except for the fact that she speaks outside in the garden to someone. There is no thought in history, as there has never been any explanation as to why meat-eating stomachs are capable of restoring youth, in fact at some point at the end of this question. Dr. Frederick claims there is no time to explain at the time that sounds to me like the people who wrote this did not have any clue! Even in a very short 68 minutes, Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, but the bad editing does not help with scenes and pictures that last too long, for example, there is a scene where an ambulance pulls outside a hospital, running up to the doors, the guy coming out, going to the back doors and opening them etc. etc. did we really need to see every detail? There is also another order where Dr. Frederick goes into the room and puts on some gloves, then she takes them away in the opposite room and puts another couple on! Personally, I think Grinter probably hasn't shot enough material so he stretches out each scene as much as possible to run the time up. I like the bizarre end, though I really do. Technical Flesh party is complete crap, I'm not sure what the budget was on this, but it must have been small, very small. Almost the whole movie takes place in a house, Dr. Frederick's laboratory consists of a table, some plastic cups and test tubes, some old electronic medical equipment and a strange screen with fun colors on it (don't ask). The kinematics are poor, the music sugar & the whole movie seems to be dubbed, badly called too. The utilization elements are also disappointing, there are a few maggot shots, but they do nothing but abound a little, there is a short scene where a dead body has its leg sawn and an OK look dismembered the corpse and limbs hanging on the hooks. The action is terrible for everyone involved, and I mean really bad, which makes the invisible dialogue even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes there are one or two unintentional fun moments, and it ends up being especially to say the least, but for the most part it is real amateur movie that quickly gets painful to watch. I doubt most will do it through this is a meeting I can tolerate just about anything, but even though I was considering turning it off. Definitely one to avoid, you will be glad you did & if you really didn't see it you weren't warned!
