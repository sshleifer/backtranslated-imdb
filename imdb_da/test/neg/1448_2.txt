The force began to look promising but quickly became boring and boring to see. The reason is about an old Aztec doll who takes possession of those who own it. The idea is "decent enough" and this movie would have been quite entertaining if it had been made better. But after the first ten minutes or so it quickly becomes boring; We do not get any good death scenes and must listen to lots of speeches. In the end, one of the occupied men meets his death by melting ahead of two girls, but it is not very interesting and certainly not gory. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend the power to any horror or slasher fan, as there is little to gain from it.
