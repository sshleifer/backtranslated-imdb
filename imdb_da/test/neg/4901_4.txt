Inspired by a true history story, is full of the 1970s feeling, but is uneven in the story. This is the story of a serious college swimmer who ends up in Phillie at a final rec center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts a swimming pool together. The film spells blindly in the first half hour until Terrence Howard, like our hero, gets the kids into the pool. At that time, it is getting something engaging, though it still spells. There is a good story in this and it is clear why Howard and Bernie Mac participated in it, but the script is poor and most of the direction seems to have made it feel like something, instead of to make us feel something for the story. /> Not the catastrophe that some reviews made it, instead it suffers from all the latest sporting true stories-Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., who at least knew you At least, work with the story to make a movie as opposed to just letting the audience suffer because "it's true".
