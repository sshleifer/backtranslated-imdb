There are interesting pieces here and about Bruce Weber's likes and dislikes. Perhaps if a professional editor had put it together for biography, I would have felt more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 on a movie festival on it. For an autobiography, almost nothing about Bruce Weber is revealed, except he likes to look at photographs, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenage boys and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and coherent film.
