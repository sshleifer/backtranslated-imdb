My first tremendously disappointing BBC / Jane Austen flick. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music is from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, looks really annoyed to be in such a stink. Even some of the casting is off. No, I take it back, a good director can make a silk bag out of a singer's ear, so to speak. The performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it is almost a farce in a Jane Austen story, which is ironic as Northanger Abbey is a kind of tribute / epitome of the early Gothic novel. I wanted to let go of the female lead after a while; who has made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to see Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!
