After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin short story and various movie versions of the book, I found myself very disappointed with the movie. I had expected a classic drama, but that was not the case. First of all, let me explain my review with the fact that I love old movies, especially mysteries and dramas, but not female-oriented films. This makes a big difference, so take my review with a big salt grain. I thought the play was a bit over the top, but it is very common in movies in this era. June Allyson was good as Jo, but I found each sister to be stereotypical and shaped the drive. There were no surprises or too dramatic moments. I hate to write negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. It has always been my intention to read the book, but after this it seems unlikely. The only warm-up story was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister, it was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing experience. Again there are others who love this movie, I'm just not one of them.
