Close but no cigar! - That's my opinion of this movie! TAG PURVIS both wrote and directed this script, which should have gone through a rewriting before recording. At times, ridiculously because or a corny script, this movie is shining star Dan Mongomery Jr. and the photographer director. Both of these talents are the ones to care for in the future. My recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and uses the rental amount on a classic!
