When I first looked at this movie, I thought it would be rally good because it featured my favorite actor all the time. He gives a sterling performance, although it is quite obvious that he did not need life more than half a finger to make the role work. He is the only good thing in it unless you are in explosions and the American dream worker's whole babe (which I am not). <br /> <br /> I don't understand. How can this movie get away with being so naive. That the little boy is saved, I mean, come on! You can't tell me he would have been saved without the guy having any goggles (I know for a fact that it would have been weak black in there and you can't see more than a few feet in front of you) and no respirator (he had cattle after 2 minutes!). This movie was just bad, okay? Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ???? !!!! <br /> <br /> Sorry if this is your favorite movie.
