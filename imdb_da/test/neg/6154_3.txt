Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I've seen it claimed that most American movies are cowboy films in disguise; that Hollywood is so in love with the only genuine original creation that it continues to reinvent the cowboys. I'm not sure I totally buy that argument, but Slipstream is evidence to support the theory; It's a cowboy movie by plane. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's going better than that. There is a Spagetti Western with airplanes! Replace the planes with horses, make the android a priest, and this movie would not be distinguished from any of half a Italian Spanish semi-arty "shoot-em-ups with pretensions" in the 70s. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't as bad as I had to believe in some of the reviews I had read here, but it certainly wasn't good.
