A rather frightening business suggests that Welsh is an infantile artist who is helplessly drawn to the violent environment he knows best, but unable to resist inappropriate deep rooting in banal fantasy. The first story is a skin-fist, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The other obtains some poignancy, but only through the eradicating excess of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most risible seems to strive to be a disturbed successor to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and rage, a slave to extreme environmental discomfort; stifling in a poorly chosen music score and in indifferent flashy action. This is pure stupidity as a guerrilla sensitivity - as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that connect the three sections.
