"Yesterday" as a movie is difficult to assess. The kinematics are excellent and deserve a 9/10. The story is gritty and genuine and does not compromise. But the translation of the story into the screen through the actors did not match the camera work. <br /> <br /> As a person born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's appearance and the honest depiction of Zulu's daily life. But this and the camera's work is not enough to recommend the average viewer should watch this movie. It requires a appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of film to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". <br /> <br /> Unlike the 1980 movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy", which was a comical look at an African culture that encounters modern technology, "Yesterday" has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience. The movie is simply not suitable for the common western mind - and I doubt it was intended for the Western mind. The scenes are long and slow, editing is not paced for a 60mph + instant gratification world. The dialogue is not split or witty, it is real. Movies about health crises do not create the best entertainment, and this film is not entertainment, it is education. <br /> <br /> This movie is best seen by those who know, appreciate and love the lifestyle and culture of sub-Sarah Africa. If you lack a broad enough world view to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, should skip this movie. Don't waste your time with it. Go to "Talladega Nights" or "Larry Cable Guy" instead of your cross culture display. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 to most people who might want to watch the movie but have no accurate understanding of African cultures. For the viewers with an understanding of movies about the human experience throughout the world, I would give it a 7.
