Rabbit fever is one of those movie shows. It's an enjoyable 90 minutes, requires a little of the viewer, and delivers so much, and on any terrestrial TV channel even in a leading time slot, I believe that canine fever would be quite well received. It makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded as a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have an addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator. The film is primarily focused on investigating a supposedly addictive quality to the famous sex aid product. The story is 100% tongue in the cheek. <br /> <br /> The storylin is strong, an introduction to some well-rounded and sympathetic characters, some enjoyable back stories, peripheral characters and situations evolve into an engaging story and pleasant conclusions. Unfortunately, there is nothing that feels wise or new. <br/> <br /> Rabbit Fever has some sharp moments, a couple of switches that suggest what the authors are capable of, and all the errands for them, it's not just 90 minute button gags and insinuation I could probably see it with my mother. But there is a laziness about some of the scenes that hold it back, the moments you went up for it when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a doll of sit-com. <br /> <br /> I chuckled, I left the theater, felt empathy for the characters, but I also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute coil made for television, light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema . <br /> <br /> I think Rabbit Fever achieves some of what it aims to do, it is a quirky subject, a rounded story, a well-presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. But there is nothing in this that can justify the extinction of a cinema environment. On the contrary - a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer the chance to grab a breath that canine fever seems to be lacking.
