I've spent some time reviewing all reviews for this movie. I totally agree with almost all reviewers by saying that Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Don't the bosses on NBC have any class? I feel sick in my stomach to actually see both parts of this mini-series. The script is so silly, so pointless, and yes, totally unacceptable! I can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this movie changed almost everything in history. God himself goes through the trouble of killing the entire Earth's people, but somehow he misses a guy who sails around and tries to sell things to Noah. Give me a break! And what about Noah's sons, who act as Indiana Jones, and save girls in need? If all that is not bad enough, there is the part where God apologizes for Noah and says "I'm sorry Noah, I was wrong". Newsflash NBC, God Can't Be Wrong! This film is the most tasteless and shameful biblical film ever made.
