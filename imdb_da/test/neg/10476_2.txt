John Knowle's modern masterpiece, a separate peace, is one of many subtle, and subtly is the wrong word, themes of love, hatred, jealousy, denial, and regret. The 1972 edition attempts to address this style and what the book is - A love story of war threatening in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use subtly at all, but an overview of the story's history. What you look at in the face as you read the novel - is a love story, and yes it is perhaps an argumentative gay love story. In the novel and the 1972 film version, there are sexual undertones throughout the scriptures and dialogue. In the 2004 Showtime movie version, these tensions were omitted, and the actors were there at the end of the twenties who played teenagers who caused mature plays, taking off from any soreness or hesitation of innocence in youth. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this remake for several reasons. The hair that broke back to the camels was that Phineas got a surname on the letters he received from the drafting tables! Finny is a character who does not have or needs a surname. John Knowles did it on purpose. <br /> <br /> Although I accepted the 1972 version, the play was sometimes a bit amateurish, so what was it trying to be sincere with the novel by shooting at Phillips Exeter Academy, The Devon Acedemy was based; as well as the author John Knowles attended as a student. <br /> <br /> The Directors and Manufacturers took all teenage Exeter students, with the exception of Parker Stevenson who attended The Brooks School, to play in a Paramount Film! Class act by preppies compared to this Canadian college shot, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - Veto on this sham try again. The 1972 movie version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real deal for A Separate Peace on the screen. Showtime 2004 movie made for cable version was not.
