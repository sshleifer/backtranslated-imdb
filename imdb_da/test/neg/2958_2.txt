The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two freaky servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently years earlier, her mother was involved in a scandal, and Ingrid returned in an attempt to annoy family who previously would have forgotten that she or her mother existed. It is because she reasons if they are shocked enough that they pay her to get rid of her. Then, with this money, she will leave New Orleans and seek a millionaire somewhere else, which she constitutes as a countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper appears and looks completely in place as a love interest. It is amazing that this movie was not the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career fell - her performance and character was So bad! Instead of the stylish and demure she usually plays in movies, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in movies. Her fake Contessa was low, demanding, unpredictable and stupefyingly stupid. How she was able to muster any man seemed a mystery when she seemed less vampire than just plain nuts !! I am not exaggerating to say that she sometimes acted as a person with a combination of a serious mental illness and a personality disorder, and all of these together make me think "who in the world would fall in love with this mess?" . Frankly, I couldn't watch for histrionics and narcissistic behavior, and she looked more like a guest at "The Jerry Springer Show" than a leading lady! Confusing, horrible and exaggerated are words that come to mind when I think of her role. The rest of the cast is frankly overwhelmed by Bergman's ranting and hysteria. While Gary Cooper is generally an excellent leader, he is dominated by her and just looks lost. And strangely, the two crews cast as her entourage - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Mrs. Robson is best known for her portrayals of Queen Elizabeth I, but for some strange reason, she violated her in makeup and the end result resembled the love child in a cigar shop Indian and Aunt Jemima! Her face was a lot of wood, she sported odd eyebrows and she dressed like a slave. As for Mr Austin, he was a dwarf, and although this was not to be opposed to him, his role was written as if he were a hips - a very, very indecisive role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! Overall, the rat plays, writing and draining make this one of the great stinkers of the ages - almost as pointless and boring as such famous turkeys as PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
