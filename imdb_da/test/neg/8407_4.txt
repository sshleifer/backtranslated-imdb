Um ... okay, it's very poor if you compare to the first movie, the very praising Rosemary's Baby. In fact, it's a pretty bad movie in general. Yes, there are some redeeming qualities, but I'll come later. <br /> <br /> Now it has been a while since the last movie took place ... actually it has been pretty much eight years I think. Rosemary is still trying to flee with her child and influence him in a good way, rather than letting him pray for the evil future that the covenant (or "tribe" as referred to here) has set before him. As she runs off with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up, leaving her child with a flax, he raises himself until he comes to an age when Satan tries to possess him, as he seems to reject his evil heritage in all the way. Of course, things don't go as planned, and then there is the end that I would have felt seriously ashamed of if I hadn't seen it when there was a sequel to "Rosemary's Baby"! Okay, when I was about 11, I witnessed the Rosemary's Baby masterpiece and then read the book's sequel. Thinking that this movie was an adaptation of it, I tracked this movie down and got it ... did I right in that? Yes, somehow, yes ... I'm a true fan of this "franchise" and can say I've seen the sequel and I have an idea of ​​what happens after the events of the first movie (talk of both this film and the "Rosemary son", Ira Levin's own book follow-up that is not yet adapted to film). <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie in the first movie, appears a few times in this movie, but why-oh-why is the cow so different? The knife Rosemary had fallen into the first movie that was shown sticking out of the ground, but Minnie took it out! The cow is now called the tribe (as I said earlier). They now walk around in hooded capes chanting "Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ... Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ..." and so on and so on. The Gothic building is now like a two-story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a little good suburb home or something! And the baby itself is quite normal, with the eyes only "boring" when he becomes angry and kills someone or something in vain. <br /> <br /> As far as the play goes, it's pretty bad on all parts except Stephen McHattie, who plays a very adult Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, who replaces Mia Farrow as Rosemary, must have one of the flattened WORST performances ever caught on film! It's so bad, it's almost not even fun ... when she screams "OH MY GOD!" and cry for like the fifteenth time in the movie, you are like "Okay, it's no fun anymore" and then she's gone, and the movie has only been for twenty minutes, are you like TANK THE LORD, I don't have to hear her say "OH MY GOD" ENDE LONGER !! Sheesh! In the end, this film has very, very, very * very few redeeming qualities, enough to get it at least four stars. But if you see it as a serious sequel to the first movie, it is virtually non-existent.
