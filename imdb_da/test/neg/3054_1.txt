Dear friends, I have never seen such a rubbish game as NATURE OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenney intended to copy classics such as THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD from the same year. The kinematics were miserable, the film was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness to the maximum. In fact, horror images must be dark, but not the way the demons night. The whole movie was ridiculous, no excitement, worse actors except Alvin Alexis in the role of roles and horrible make-up effects. An average 5 star vote for that movie? I can't believe this. Perhaps the users were happy with the actors' tits, donkeys and pussy, they were actually worth 5 stars. Regards Hans-Dieter
