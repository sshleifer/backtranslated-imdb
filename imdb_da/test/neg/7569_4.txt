This is a family film in the 1950s rural America about a boy whose uncle presses kills charges against his dog Drum, not only starting a family law feud, but community suffering as their city begins to take sides. <br /> <br /> These are formal movies that are trying to be very touching and sweet. Its biggest weakness is that the only people who could really trade were Scott Bakula (defense lawyer), Ron Perlman (father / drum owner) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair", as uncle and his wife were okay.) The kids were not so good (basically they looked like they were acting) and that is a problem When movies are really about them (Aaron Fors, who plays the bubble Donny, makes me think about what actress Russell Crowe must have looked like a child, with no talent but much ham). <br /> <br /> Favorite line (spoken by the prosecutor after Scott Bakula's defense test): "We'll be lucky if they don't lighten us." <br /> <br /> Favorite line presented by Ron Perlman (after his son strikes the bully): "Now he does your friend, it will be the hard part." <br /> <br /> Sweet enough to rent / buy used.
