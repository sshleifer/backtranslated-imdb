I really liked this movie. Well, the play was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the lamest I've seen. Michael Bernardo as Dante is worth laughing at himself, with an incredibly fun catch and evil laugh. But it's worth seeing just for the WORST explosion you'll ever see outside of the Power Rangers TV series. You know it when you see it. Honestly, this movie should have the budget for a low class porn. I stopped almost after an hour, but I recommend looking through it all; At least there is plenty of eye candy for everyone to enjoy. Recommended for viewers with great tolerance to bad movies.
