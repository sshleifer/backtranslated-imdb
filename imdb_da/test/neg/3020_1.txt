It's just what we need, a show about the people who don't like in high school or university. Man or woman. People who objectify others and congratulate themselves for doing so are exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is just disgusting to do exactly that. <br /> <br /> So four men sit in chairs and see two other guys trying to gather women to have sex with them. And finally one of the two, big ... wins just f-n big. I also have to accept these four shower bags as being "judges" of people's "Game". The term "games" must be the most moronic thing to get out of modern English since the term "Bling Bling" added to these men is called "experts" just makes me throw up what is left of my respect for modern culture. It is not about godly role models, they are the result of the MTV culture that will bite us in the line. If you enjoy the haze that spills into the sides of this monstrosity, you probably think Paris Hilton and Britany Spears have talent. It's not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking about it. <br /> <br /> And for all the people who want to say I want better if I was laid down or just jealous. Go screw yourself, for it is obvious that a real girl certainly will not.
