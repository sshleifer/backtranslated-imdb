This movie was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny movies I've seen for a long, long time. To be fair, I didn't expect any revolutionary cartoon formula, but at least I expected to be entertained. With such low expectations, how could I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did a little more than the water in this movie. He seems to have returned to his calm facial roots and created a character that is no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (a.c. Fletcher 2.0) is a poorly reproduced and miserably written whelp. If you find yourself smiling while looking at this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because Carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. Carrey's foreign posing becomes humorously awkward - and ultimately sad. Te Leoni as Jane does a little more than give Abbott to Carrys Costello. I typically find Tea Leoni refreshing and underutilized, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been easily played by any actress of age thirty-five, and it is in the non-specificity that Jane's character becomes uninteresting. She simply has no other feature than her after the film's general theme, which seems to be ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you count "Big Business is Evil" as a theme. I thought it was more of a given. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both deliver credible (but tired) supportive notions, but no one really seems to be invested in the role they play. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin put so much effort into playing his role as the creepy C.E.O. as he puts in eating a sandwich (which he seems to have made much lately). Little key, but has Alec Baldwin played some roles in the last few years that have not required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? <br /> <br /> Anyway, take my advice if you haven't already experienced horror for yourself: save your money. This is the one that catches on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there is no fun to be had.
