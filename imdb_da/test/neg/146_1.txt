Exceptionally stupid actions with braindead lead to a story that would have looked after a full question by Spiderman. The action sequences never flow right as they should and leave some chilly bits of orphans in a sea of ​​sound and rage, which means nothing. I really wonder how they release this in the West. Sam Lee overwhelms as crazy, beginner Edison Chan doesn't show any acting talent yet. The robot is lumpy and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (though made by American sfx people) are ridiculous and completely destroy any remaining defaults. I'm not looking forward to Gen-Z Cops ...
