This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course it is false. But it is painful to see. I know personally more creative film-influenced thoughts that could "do" this seem real. The young leading man couldn't be more convincing. He reads everything he says. Do we really think he knows what he's talking about? There is an abundance of ways that Blair-Witch creates this. Fear does not breed from what seems "cool" and computer generated. It also does not generate such proverbial lines as "What was it?" Have you heard? "There are also genuine convincing psychiatrists out there who will not just" be on the screen. "Another DUH factor is ... how do these manufacturers believe that we will actually buy the paranormal activity, will just magically happen within the 2 may be 3 days (if we are lucky) those movies, I don't think .. A 2+ week in one place would be more convincing, it is also disarming that they believe, including "Nasa radar checks" and computers, showing fancy bs really makes us afraid. AND IE: Exorcisms should not be recorded as the movie "The Exorcist." When should they get it right? Possession of the devil or other evil spirits affects people differently. They do not just speak and lower their voice as Linda Blair or falling around as Courtney Love on a drug binge As mentioned above, better concentrations on "mental ability" will help this show a lot. We want to see and hear everything that seems to flash in front of them. In one final note sk monkeys Shooting Stars are not interested in displaying false images of UFOs in advance. May I emphasize that the young, dark-haired man hosting this show is completely down - just awful. Avoid this show. Too scary: see old unresolved mystery episodes ... not the new ones (recreation got it oh so wrong). But that's for another blog.
