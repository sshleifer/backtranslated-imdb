Enjoy the opening credits. They are the best things about this second-rated, but unofficial, time-killer that contains dangerous beliefs from, for example, Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to the newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who looks a little smaller for this kind of action, but who occasionally manages to project a banty-rooster kind of warfare. The first time we see him, he is combed, sweaty and engaged in the favorite "beefcake" activity - chopping wood. After that, he has seven more scenes without his shirt, including one where he is hung by his wrists and zapped with el a la Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon." However, he could use a better script because the way he exposes the truth about corruption and violence in prison is never convincing. There are also millions of dollars that are apparently tied to this study, but never explained. However, there are a few pluses. Submitting "John Woodrow" undercover as "John Wilson" is an entertaining game on a presidential name, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as an effort which, at the beginning of the case, is being hanged by his wrists and becoming turned off by a burly guard. A final note: The film's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras". Despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 inmates! (Note: The cast credits at the end are not too useful. For the record, the burly, bald leader using Jody Nolan as a punch bag is played by Bill Fishback and the young, fair guard who manages electric shock to Tommy Lee Thomas is played by Marc Chenail.)
