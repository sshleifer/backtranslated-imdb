There is nothing wrong with softcore, but this is quite clinical - lots of nudity, but it is completely false (of course it's always false - it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it is all random nudity and bad acts of "desire" and sex with each other. Of course, part of it is your personal preference. These women obviously have some body problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that too plastic and leathery look so if that's your thing - well, you get to see all of this. I don't think that the expectations of others are very high when you look at a movie title like this, but for many people, it would be pretty much looking at cyborg fembots ... they seem almost real, but it's really scary.
