Before I took a job as a reviewer, I never went to movies like this and so fortunately remained unaware that in the Hollywood movie's soul lies a deeply woman-hating spirit who thrives to lay her broken knees on the silver screen for everything to either empathy with or revile. Or is this just a particularly bad year? An ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here we have another seemingly sweet, innocent, beautiful woman beaten deadly weapon. The kind that warns us that under each pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wildly deserted animal guaranteed to make everybody's life within 50 miles a living hell. This month's copy is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler) whose simple dreams include having his own little house, a backyard fountain and a mondo home entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first 3-year movie), the dunky bartender she picks up at McCool's one night, intending to steal, is less materially oriented. The kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet, he prefers to cling to his dead mother's house with few residential complexes saving his snow collection. <br /> <br /> In the same low-interest bar, the devil in the red dress also encounters Randy's cousin, Carl (the very entertaining Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego St Louis size. When things go south within hours, go into the widower's specialist with a heart of gold (John Goodman). The result? Three men maintain large, bad crushes on the leopard-clad offspring of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell crushes, causing them to do things that common sense would normally contraindicate. Like getting involved in the first place. <br /> <br /> More views and flashbacks coincide with the front page news of how easy it is to become a victim of its libido, especially if you are male. Since each of these men relates his perspective to a confidential, his desire to possess The Jewel has the colors "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things come together in a relatively entertaining way. But it is entertainment from the same source that tells you that the popcorns actually taste like butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian commercial and music video director Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is evident in some of the fantasy segments, including one about a car wash, soap and a snake that you can probably extrapolate. It is also the debut project of the production company, owned by Michael Douglas, who has found his niche as a topped sleezeball in a bingo salon. <br /> <br /> Dillon and Tyler will hardly win any gold statues for this, though considering the one-dimensional nature of their overdone movie noir-type characters, you can't really fault them. More minor roles pull out unexpected guests - Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as both hoodlum Utah and his hunter brother. (Finally an end to all the aggression.) <br /> <br /> This movie speaks unlimited amounts of the dynamics between men and women - or men and their mummies. But in the end you will probably find more lasting psychological truths in a Bugs Bunny episode. I would say that it is better, more fun, more sophisticated than other recent gemstones like TOMCATS, but do we really have to choose what to look for, what is the lowest on the misogynism scale?
