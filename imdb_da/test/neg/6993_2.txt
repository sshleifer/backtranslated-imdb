So pathetic, it's not even fun. From the first scene in the movie, I knew I was in a bad time. Thank God, I only saw this movie on TV. The story line was horrible, not to mention the actor. It was awful. Very unreal and unusual things happened in this movement as. The lady puts a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he just leaves the keys. I'm like, GET REAL. The creator's miserable attempt to create a futuristic city even deepened my aversion to the film. To tell you the truth, the only good thing in this movie was at all the struggles that were in themselves rather paralyzed. All I could ask myself when I watched this movie was "when does it go!"
