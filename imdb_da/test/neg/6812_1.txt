Have you ever had one of these nights as you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on? That was how I ran over this tripe. For myself, I would have been better off throwing and turning in the 97 minutes I wasted with this movie. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to be "real", the film's characters appear as such gangsta stereotypes that history should have been the prerequisite for a Wayans brothers movie. Dialogue? Please! It sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this movie. The editing was horrible. One of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chasing down a bunch of narrow alleyways. Cut to the characters being chased and they run through a park complete with baseball fields in the background. When any of our "homies" are shot in this movie, he miraculously blows through clothes that do not have holes, which is more than I can say to the plot of this predictable load .... baking soda. Indie movies can be great, even if they don't have budget and effect, but they still need cinematic integrity. If I could have given it a 0, I would. If you see it, I hope it is on cable because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. In fact, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
