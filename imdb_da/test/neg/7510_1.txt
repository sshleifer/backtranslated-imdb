I work in the video store that rents this video in Lexington and I have to say ... it should never have been done. I even know some of the people who worked on what regrets it. Bad effects, horrid action, bad script especially. I swear the dialogue would not have passed to the original PSX Resident Evil; It's so bad. If you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this movie to learn a thing or two. If not, don't waste your time. And even the director knows it stinks because he keeps coming in to try to get us to record the movie. No, sir. I've seen two-thirds of the horror section, and those rates are even lower than Plan 9 from outer space. Even Ed Eood would have said, "No, it's too stupid even for me."
