The movie begins with a dandy gunfight, where three bandits are quickly shot down by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who carries more than just a shallow to the man with no name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR ERROR DOLLARS MORE AND IT GOOD BATH AND THE NUMBER). <br /> <br /> Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Of course, the shipment is being transferred and the soldiers are fighting all as blind guys so they are quickly neutralized. But in a twist, one of the bandits cheats the band leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold. Soon Roland catches up and is finding out where the gold is hidden. But right at that moment, the army shows and kills the traitor .... bummer. But one with no name wannabe believes that Roland knows about the treasure, and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor key. A strange banker is also thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three seem beautiful macho. All in all, this is not a particularly prominent Western one. Much of it is plotted, part of it is that George Hilton (an Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other leading Spaghetti Western stars, but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks. So often the music doesn't even come close to matching the play, and it seems almost randomly added. Plus, it's just not that good stuff as well. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone's music master in the Spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just a time game - and not very good to start.
