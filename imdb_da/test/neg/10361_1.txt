I mean nothing happens, 5 stupid children go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ... it could have been fun if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues were not half an inch of fun. The only thing I almost showed my teeth on was when the stupid police stopped teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas ... The plot could have been fun if it hadn't been too scary interpretation. If you're even thinking of watching this bit-of-crap movie, don't. How stupid is the guy getting away from the police by telling them he is gay, just like his friend did (just not pretending ...) and there is the stupid hitch joke about the many meanings of the word "gay ". I laugh my hair out ....... NOT ....... Anyway ... WORST MOVIE I've ever seen !!
