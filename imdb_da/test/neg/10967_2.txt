A look at the review should tell you that this movie was voted by shills in an effort to artificially increase the film's ratings. <br /> <br /> This movie does not bring anything new to the Zomer citizens. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (in acting and movies) and derived in its plot. Make-up looks terrible and the zombies look even worse when they are shot. Lines are stiffly delivered and poorly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter who is the only good actor in this mess of a movie. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), the Ryn protagonist and the leading bad guy. I've seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> This is a self-proclaimed "zombie western", but the only thing that makes this a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the real actor's real name is Clint. The protagonist is not cool and mysterious as a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero he does not have the clever crackling attitude to remove it either. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the fake glowing reviews. This is just another B-grade zombie movie that is competitively designed for the budget it has (it has decent lighting), but it is a set of low budget, first time, and bad acting. There are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish.
