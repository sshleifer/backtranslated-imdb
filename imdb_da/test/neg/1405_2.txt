============ BIG SPOILER =================================== This is a horrible movie without similar characters. So many clich√©s and meaningless scenes. It needs a good editor, but then there may not be any movies left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. The description read "moments of dark comedy". Maybe I missed them when I blinked. The horrible characters begin right at the funeral. The funerals laugh and complain about the food while they are buried by a very young man who has committed suicide? So does the father dig for the only son left? Right at the funeral? How is it that the neighbor's neighbor, whose husband cheated on her with Sigourney Weaver's character, is the bad guy to tell the man? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano even though everyone else around him knows he is a great pianist. The movie tries to push all dramatic cliches into a movie: Father passing athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family loses a chosen son to suicide, the son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, matrimonial matters, child perceived through affair but raised as man's son, incest , gay tendencies, bullying, possible terminal illness, etc., etc., should not waste your 2 hours.
