This movie should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an outstanding actor, but he himself could not save this tale of a young woman seeking the truth of her sister's death. Spoiler Warning: In fact, the truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs. Not much of a twist and not that interesting either. The movie is also overcharged with too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing. All in all, it is definitely worth missing out - not to be recommended.
