This is a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only bet on IMDb. The camera's work and lighting were both surprisingly good and the actor ?? although variable ?? is better than what is often found in indie genre flicks. <br /> <br /> As a management, Robert Field is quite stiff, which is particularly unfortunate as his character, Claude, is the film's narrator as well as the center of its action. But it was the entrance to Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this movie ?? and not in a good way. A twist is introduced in a lumpy way, and slowly being pulled out and too properly. <br /> <br /> Pete Barker, on the other hand, is consistently entertaining as Father William. He is the easy challenge in what is a fairly common offer. While the first half hour caught my interest, I ended up feeling completely disappointed with how things played out.
