An annoying and talented American documentary producer learns about a legendary <br /> <br /> South African monster, half-cast. Tradition says it is a semi-human, half-leopard being with the closest parallel as the guardian of European tradition. Instead of focusing on the creature, the film follows the players' meandering. There is little action or excitement until late in the movie. This problem is exacerbated by many annoying characters that create an incessant amount of even more annoying speech. The basic premise is wasted as it is equated with the unexplained focus on the documentary. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach to The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). No matter what the movie fails at most levels. Avoid at all costs.
