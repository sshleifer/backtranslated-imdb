From the creators of Underworld, we have by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, but lacks vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a big deal) and generally almost anything that could possibly be done right to produce a decent movie dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). A twenty-lycanthrope chocolate producer named Vivian currently lives in Romania ever since her family was hunted and executed in front of her years ago in America to be werewolves. There she belongs to a small community (or parcel) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly win the parcel leader, Gabriel, whose son - any pad with a British accent - takes it on himself to hunt outside the parcel. They have apparently been discovered in other countries earlier and want to remain resident in Romania by avoiding negative attention, so such activity is, of course, considered prohibited. Vivian ends up falling in love with an American artist who is unaware of her involvement with the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get cluttered when someone is killed and man is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is loose in the woods and chases - giving the package a chance to transform into theirs. "wolfy" himself. All this really consists of is a big leap before they turn on and land like a wolf. Very soft effects. The whole movie is like a tame underworld with some drippy, romantic montage and very little action. See this in the theater, I couldn't wait for it to end. A devastatingly boring disappointment. Avoid!
