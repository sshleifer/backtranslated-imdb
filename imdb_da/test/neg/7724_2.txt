When Uwe Boll, who released the first House Of The Dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one should be incredibly moronic to consider making a sequel. In fact, Hollywood's per capita ratio of morons must be high, because we have not only a sequel, it was distributed in the fashion modes of Sony, a company that is not usually known for its taste in expensive depreciation. Published directly on television in America, the sequel improves in most respects on the original, but it gets so gently rather than interesting. The scope of the scenario has been expanded, with the action taking place in a deserted city that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can revive the dead have occurred. The action is particularly spread throughout the university, where the first infected citizens can be found. The film simply differs from the original, as it actually occurs in a house where dead people can be found. <br /> <br /> The cast, on the other hand, is a real step back. Emmanuelle Vaugier was especially made to look like a rental Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the throw never reached a dormant level - the JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is a Sticky Fingaz that would probably not be recognized as easy by the people he is facing at home. Simply put, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. Say what you want about Boll, but at least he has inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight his awkwardness. Having said that, the people involved here seem at least to be aware that their movie sucks and that they might as well have fun with it. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was making some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took it seriously. Unfortunately, where the actors fail to take their characters or problems seriously, which little dramatic tension might have been, is undermined. Much of the plot relates to the search for a generation zero for whatever plague causes the dead to rise. Or to translate into more practical terms, they try to find someone who was infected right after the virus mutated into a form that threatened humans. How this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is a person's guess, but the way this quest is expelled has problems with itself. The vi-to-go-back-plot is used to cover the expiration time, but the actual timing of the extra search is also problematic. We are told at a time that the city will be wiped out by Cruise missiles in ten minutes, but the heroes return to the university, find the sample they are looking for, and fight enough zombies to eat the Chinese army, all this time . Filmmakers note: it only pays to be specific over time when it can serve rather than prevent dramatic excitement. <br /> <br /> The special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 leave the originals in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, Michael Hurst uses all the graphic details his budget allows. Neck is bitten, arms are cut off, head is shot. It all creates a far more convincing flow, but it also allows to hope for the obvious fakery. The photography is also much improved. As DVD Crypt puts it, the fact that it is in focus all the time is an improvement of the original, but it also robs us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. Scripture is also both an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, referrals are offered to other horror and survival fear games, which are the most obvious as Run Like Hell. The first few times they work because they offer wise ways to work titles in the ordinary, everyday dialogue. After the eighth time they just get on their nerves because they are reminiscent of gamers of things they prefer to do with their time. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, House Of The Dead 2 cost only 6 million to bring to TV screens throughout America. As Tom Savini alone would cost more than this to work on a movie today, I have to say that I am a little impressed with the visual results. Unlike the very damaged original, the zombies look like real zombies instead of extras in bad makeup shots badly. In a further contrast to the original, the actors seem to have a clue as to what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real singers scattered everywhere, the characters speak like real people. However, history is nothing that we have not already seen a thousand times. When foreigners, the real queen of the dead or the evil death were released for recognition, the recognition came out that these films either did something we hadn't seen before, or did so well that we didn't really worry. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough for us not to suck it, but it does not bring anything new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we do not end up breaking. <br /> <br /> For that reason and many others I gave House Of The Dead 2 a two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. Unless you are in sucky movies as much as I am, you are best to remove it.
