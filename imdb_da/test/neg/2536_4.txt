Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon begin in Switzerland, which the world's leading detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) leaves Nazi and controls to smuggle a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) out of the country and to the relative security of London But is London as safe as Holmes believes? Dr. Tobel has designed a revolutionary new bomb vision that will change air bombardment forever and he has agreed to give it to the British government, but the Nazis want the just as bad & Holmes arch enemy Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) plan to steal secret from bomb sight and sell it to Nazi. Add the bumbling Inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey) in Scotland Yard, Dr. Tobel's love interest Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), assassins, mysterious scientists and a spooky coded message & Holmes has his work cut out to keep Dr. Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight ... Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between 1939 and 1946 to include Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann is based on the short 'The Dancing Men' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle & is not the tradition of Holmes murder mystery, as it is more of a wartime adventure story. To neglect what Holmes is about, the solution of complex crimes and mysteries is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned & the inclusion of the Nazis & the war as the backdrop of history feels out of place, awkward and just not I sit for well with me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they could not make a crook for it and as a whole it is far less engaging than others in the series. However, it is at least short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual efficient work, but you have to cut it a little limp and remember that it was made over 60 years ago. It has no real style or imagination and lacks both atmosphere and intrigue. Technically, the movie is ok, if it is unspecified, the black and white film is fine, although I understand that a computer-colored version is also available. The action is okay, Bruce & Hoey make their usual cartoon help & Rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous and I'm glad he changed it to later installments. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were a disappointment compared to some of the other great items in the series, there is very little that I can recommend and everything that made each other so good seems to missing here. Let this last and see some of the better first, only for the bad fans.
