Only one word can describe MR MAGOO - slapstick. Unfortunately, it's not an AIRPLANE. Looks can be decive, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, a bumbling near a blind man stumbling across a pair of jewel thieves. Now he has to chase them down by using ... blindness basically. And that's all this movie plays out. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Now, maybe if they had some fun jokes involving this, but it's pretty much one of those "stupid stupid laughs on your face because you're too shy to admit you're paying to watch these" movies. <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it is hacked to be. It has at least some fun jokes, and it's good fun for the whole family (Nielson tried to make a "NAKED GUN" for families in MAGOO, but it's not as close as possible). Then see it once, you can hate it, you can love it, regardless. I didn't hate it personally, but I didn't like it, or even judge it "okay". 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
