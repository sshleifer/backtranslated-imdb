Get Shorty was an excellent movie. It was fun and had the perfect balance of strong comic plays and a serious plot. Be Cool is like some cheap refunds trying to pass for a successor. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it as if he was a boring film excerpt, rather than a boring film exam that used to be Shylock. Uma Thurman, who is fantastic in almost every role she has ever played, comes as stressed and confusing. Should she be drowsy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add all the movie clips you can think of. A well-educated reporter of Cedric the Entertainer, a monstrous gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul and a good set of tubes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black guy in Vince Vaughn and a stupid celebrity como by Stephen Tyler. The only fun part was Rocken, who discovers his own new clich√© as a gay bodyguard actress Wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT DOES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was smart with Chili playing a group against another and coming out on top. But this movie tries it with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty are warned: this is a very different, worse movie.
