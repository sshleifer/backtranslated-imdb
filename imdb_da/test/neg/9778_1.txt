I wasted 5 dollars renting this complete crap. Dr. Zack is the most illegal lead character I've ever seen. The film was full of EVERY clich√© you could ever think of and did not contain a single original of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by robust aliens, all the guys had 'too proud to take advice' attitudes that are as old as grandmother's Christmas cake. The concept and deaths were really cool, but they lose all the news when the monster is revealed. (read SPOILER at the end) Nothing else is really revealed, but the end is the greatest cop-out you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. The dialogue is lacking and it is an understatement. There is mostly just random shouting, thoughtful staring and chunky phrases. The actors are just GOD REASON! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it hurts me. I just wonder if the director himself saw it when it was done. <br /> <br /> The SPOILER ALERT! SAVE 5 DOLLARS! That this doesn't make any evolutionary benefit whatsoever, and that the ants just killed the one who was available, even though the movie seems to be killing of necessity. This movie made me stupid. things) that destroy all the other ants. Pretty cliche eh? He almost knocks at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to motherhood that overcomes him. Give me a break.
