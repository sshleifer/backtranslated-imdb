I'm a big Shirley Temple fan. When I watched this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child Shirley was. Ashley Rose Orr may have made the worst on-screen Shirley. Imagine an 11-year-old playing Shirley Temple from the age of 5. It's in itself wrong. But does her "imitate" Shirley's voice? And her song is unhappy. The dance was good, I say. As previous users have said, there were some dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to see more of the worldwide phenomenon that Shirley Temple created. There was too much focus on the Wizard of Oz, as in reality Shirley was just considered for Dorothy. The film depicts it as being the end of the world when she doesn't get the role. Shirley herself said she was happy Judy Garland was playing her. For me, the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For great Shirley Temple movies, see Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
