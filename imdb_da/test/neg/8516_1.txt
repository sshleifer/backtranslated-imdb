I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I saw this show when it came to A&E some years ago. The show was oddly mild, but I gave it a try because I liked these actresses. This has to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I didn't want to see it again and certainly wouldn't waste money buying the video. The story of this TV version is ridiculous and simply stupid! "Kicker" (pun intended) comes when ruth has surgery on her legs. That kind of nonsense belongs to James Bond and Sci-Fi movies. If this version is true for the book, then I will not check out the book from my local library! The American version came out a few years after I saw this original. To my surprise, the Americans got the right time when their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne played for laughs and is quite fun. When playing for laughs, the story works.
