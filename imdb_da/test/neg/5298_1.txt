Travolta and Thurman deserved a better movie. This is very secondary in all aspects, not a single fresh idea. But the biggest problem is this film's ridiculous philosophy. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive Mickey Mouse-like heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony. Maybe this matches real life. But showing it as a perfectly normal "happy" is beyond my imagination. "What's wrong with shooting a few bad Ukrainians if they're not politically correct?" - The show must continue! It makes me believe that Hollywood writers have a big problem separating good and evil, even though the genre should be a "black comedy".
