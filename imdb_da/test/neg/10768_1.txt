The screenwriters of this mini-series should have been convicted of the guillotine itself. They beat a very funny story and wasted Richard E. Grant's talents. The only thing that the authors kept from the original books was the name. All the characters were completely changed and the story was not the same. I highly recommend seeing another version of Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this one.
