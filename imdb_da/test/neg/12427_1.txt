I think this is one of the few movies I will judge as low as possible, just to pay it a compliment. I haven't seen this movie for about 25 years, so I really can't say much about it. It still seems very difficult to find video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled across it somewhere in the toxic brewing of the UHF channel television from the mid-1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I never saw the start of the movie, but I saw most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple throws out of a campsite, and they row to an island to get out, and then they are attacked by a crazy scooter in a kilt with an ax! They are able to escape from him, but are attacked by Loch Ness Monster, who in this movie is only a head and a neck without a body. The eyes and mouth of the monster do not even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. I think I had literally never seen anything like this before, and it was totally blown away. I had seen some bad movies on TV in the early 80's, but I had never seen anything so utterly scary and so casually and thoughtlessly built that it seemed that the people who did it spent less time and effort than we saw it. I had already seen some of the Troma movies and the kind of things that would intentionally be "campy", but that was the clean and real thing, and that was my first encounter with really great bad filmmaking. This movie was like the last gasp in the drive-in era, and I caught it in time. In fact, when we saw it, we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or 70s. Appears it came out a few years before I saw it. Later I got in touch with the Mystery Science Theater and found out many of the old B movies and series, but I had already seen it in this movie. The movie is so fun that I never even laughed hard at Monty Python crew or Bill Murray or any comedian. After watching this movie I always tried to search for the "good bad" movies and I got many of my friends into it. But this movie was and is basically an impossible to find. I have never really figured out what it was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s when IMDb left and the Internet went off and information began to pass. But this film still has to be discovered by many others who might appreciate its transcendental bad qualities. Look for it.
