I just watched this movie in a nice air-conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And since the temperature outside floats somewhere around 37 Â° C with very high humidity, my 100Bt is not wasted. <br /> <br /> I have not seen such a piece extremely suitable junk for a long time. This is the kind of movie that gives a taste test as it was. Anyone who claims to suffer or love it immediately goes to the same list of tasteless phonies that still go around talking about the British television's superiority. At least, the gormless old width in the wheelchair was good for some guffaws. Pseudo-depth and bold lips, while being characteristic of very French cinema, are really not a good film production. I'd rather see the Independence Day 10 times in a row than sitting through this stink again.
