If you took all the items in a Shrek movie (grumpy oars, annoying donkey, cute kitty, mandatory dance numbers, etc.), put them in a blender and condensed it for 20 minutes, you would have this mess. Painful to see; Perhaps I have been due once. The story and the dialogue rushed beyond understanding, with the voice actors obeying as they rang in their lines. The last recast of the "The Christmas Story" poem felt that it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With its desperate attempt to be hip and current, this show will be far outdated and forgotten, while classics like "The Grinch ??" will remain timeless. A sad game for all the efforts involved, a real "jump of the shark" for the Shrek franchise.
