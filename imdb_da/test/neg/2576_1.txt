It is unlikely that Seagal will ever scale the heights of lethargy he did with * On Deadly Ground * (primarily because no one will ever let him go again), but he is sure he will not try? <br /> <br /> This is a typical brainless and poorly written little fantasy of how Indian drugs are far more effective than Western medicine. In fact, Seagal seems to believe in this nonsense, though he never explains why life expectancy in America and Europe is so much higher than in 1492. <br /> Just as he never explains how his supposed "water-powered engines" work in * On Deadly Ground *. <br /> <br /> Even "action" in this sucker.
