Incredible. I have never seen anything like this. Everything is bad; really bad. From photography (lots of scenes without focus!) To the actor (the young woman is horrible). And what can we say about the helicopters made in Paint Brush ...? Really awesome B, I mean, Z movie. <br /> <br /> The reason is bad, clich√© and poorly written. Basic amenities for the script seem to work. I can't even think of a young cinema student doing this movie. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I recommend not even thinking about watching this movie. Sleeping or playing lonely are the best choices. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
