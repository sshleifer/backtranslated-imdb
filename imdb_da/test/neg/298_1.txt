How can you make a mafia joke? It's not that kind of thing to laugh at! A close movie can't make me laugh because I compare it with Jane Austen's Mafia! Mafia! was not a good movie, but hoods are really worse! In Mafia! There were some good jokes, but in this there are maybe two or three ... that make you smile. Not so bad actors, but very bad scenario !! We certainly prefer something serious like The Godfather. I give it * out of *****.
