The beginning of the movie is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) hears the story of the incident that happened on the day she was born, the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone) increases her ability to find out about it is true or not, and the fact that she also plays the piano, which is not such a distant idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son and on the way uncovers the fact that there are some secrets in that family so much in itself. <br /> <br /> O.K. We have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here. Mika Muller's character is over with us, who understands her motives for her action, and she is not interesting enough to care for her. The piano scenes look fake and the entire piano part plot doesn't add anything to the insight of the character, but serves to make the movie longer than it should have been in the first place. <br /> In short, a very disappointing Chabrol excursion that can do better than this
