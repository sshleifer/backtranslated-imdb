I have to say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD to Kill. <br /> <br /> sees Seagal making his fun martial arts on people. I have always been looking forward to Seagal-Movies, and unfortunately I was only disappointed with GLIMMER MAN, which I found really bad. THE FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagal ever acted in. Proudly boring, poorly edited, wrong soundtrack and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor and stay away from this! Honestly: Stay away!
