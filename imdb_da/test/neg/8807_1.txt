"Hood Rat" is absolutely horrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I just can't believe this movie was made, let alone distributed. Someone in Universal Studios thought people would watch and like this "movie". The only good thing in this is is-T as the landlord. He was fun. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate in movies is sped up action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE film is like that. Each scene transition is some fast-moving special effects. The director should be banned from making movies forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, Never watch this movie!
