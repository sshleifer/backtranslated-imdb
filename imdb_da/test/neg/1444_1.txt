Put this movie out of it's misery and burn the negatives. What do I say? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, only a very few will find this movie at least appealing. This is what the great American majority would call for much sex and violence. It will probably appear on a non-premium cable channel, one day just for the shock value, but after you have edited the nudity (most of the violence will remain), all that will be left is 45 minutes of really bad action which changes with 45 minutes of advertising. There are just too many starving actors in Hollywood.
