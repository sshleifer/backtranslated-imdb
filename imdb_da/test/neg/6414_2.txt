Apparently, a massive head wounds the cure for homicidal tendencies that make a murderous sociopath a lovable and oafish dog trap. Also (this for the ladies) it seems that the front of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot to meet potential helpers. Only two of the approx. 23 absurdities we must accept for this movie, to have any meaning. I love movies and I thought, as I suppose, many Americans do (forgive me if I'm wrong) that Hollywood turned out to be the best product. I've come to learn how sad, naive and brainwashed I was, and 2) how much more sophisticated European / Asian cinema is compared to its US counterpart. I saw this allegedly disruptive psychological "thriller" night following a screening of a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. When the camera faded into Walter Sparrow's happy little family, enjoying a good quality time around a room with a visit to a prison (not to mention the patronizing voice-over that deepens the virtue to do the right thing), I suddenly had an epiphany . I just finished watching a movie that made me feel like I had just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was sated, but it was strictly utilitarian. The assumption was mildly interesting, but the story itself with its countless "coincidences" (How do we explain her to find the book? We just say something, "... Or did the book find her?" They'll buy it), gaping plot holes (why took the wifey skeleton?), predictability and mandatory happy ending, turned out to be just another Hollywood hack job. Additionally, the molding of Jim Carrey was just wrong. At any time, I felt he was able to break into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or into Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed hard-boiled policeman who enjoys slavery and hard sex? Didn't buy it a second. <br /> <br /> You want to disturb? Deeply disturbing? See the suicide club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass of suicide of 54 schoolgirls. The movie opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling on a metro station platform. We then look at horror as they stand up, hold their hands and look forward to throwing themselves in front of a fast-moving commuter train. Needless to say, there is a lot of chaos. It's as far as I go with the story because I urge the reader to watch the movie. In fact, I'm not sure if I could outline the plot even though I wanted to. What begins as a simple mystery quickly goes down into a grotesque imagery. Did I understand the movie? No 拷 斤 拷 not originally as many of the foreign films my boyfriend has introduced me to. So of course I thought it was "bad". But this lingered in my mind. I went to bed and thought about the movie and woke up the next morning and looked it up at IMDb. I read some of the viewer's comments and was astonished at 1) the insights others had derived from the film and 2) the fact that I had so thoroughly missed the whole point in the movie. I realized I was so used to being spoon fed the "message" from Hollywood that when I confronted a movie that actually required the viewer to participate ?? To actually think for themselves, I totally disagreed. It's as if I had been conditional on "checking my brain at the door" in the theater. <br /> <br /> Am I, of course, that Suicide Club is the biggest movie ever made? Of course not. It has its faults, many of which were reported wisely by IMDb reviewers. Do I say that all American films are bad and all foreign films are good? Again? Of course not. My point is that there is a whole world of film making outside of Hollywood, a body of work that involves the viewer; Forcing them to think and ask questions about movies that do not telegraph plotting, follow a strict linear order and above all do not offend the person's intelligence. I am looking forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new movie that doesn't "think of me".
