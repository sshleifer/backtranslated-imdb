For a movie that was most seen in its original South Korea for most of 2004, it was a huge disappointment. Shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make over-emotional, melodramatic films. The movie was over 130 minutes long, but not much happened, and everything that happened was pretty much what you expected, the plot was so transparent. Went there, if you were Korean yourself, you might get into it more, but for me it didn't do much. Suffice it to say that, as is the case with Korean cinema, it is about the relationship between the northern and southern peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination from death sentence prisoners to kill Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> A boring plot doesn't disturb me much if the characters are good, but unfortunately it's not the case this time either. They are stereotypes, and most of the play is mediocre and too often just over the top, as it usually is in Korean cinema. Too much time is spent on the many assemblies, and the characters remain distant, one-dimensional cardboard cuts. They should have spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how hard and cruel the training and the soldiers are. One thing that reminds us is that there is a minor of two errors is still wrong.
