"The Core" meets "Crack in the World" (1965 made for television). The action is stocked, the excitement predictable. When you draw all the plot ripped from "The Core" - basically the manned drill - you join the plot "Crack in the World". "Crack" was a truly outstanding movie by Dana Andrews. His team of researchers working in South Africa drilled down to the chimney and "struck through" with an atomic device to provide a stable source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates also disagrees with a brilliant researcher. He believes that the explosion will not drill a simple hole, but will instead form cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He's right. In order to stop the resulting crack from destroying the ground, they must place another nuclear device in the path of the burst. <br /> <br /> Although I have posted a spoiler warning, I don't know if I really spoiled something for each movie. And since "Crack in the World is only available in very rare VHS format, if it's not at all my decision not to disclose whether the counter-blocker works, it's probably academic." All in all, I consider "Descent" just below average.
