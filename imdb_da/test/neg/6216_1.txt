I can't remember, at least for the last ten years or so, a movie I've seen less than Mama Mia. From the non-existent act to the terrible song, I was about to ring at least once a minute. I don't think I could even remember a short segment that I tolerated. I know I will never see this disaster again. I can't believe it with such high expectations because of the talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan that a movie could be such a flop. But to see the lack of working skills shown, the apparent drug-induced dance, and then horrors of horror, to hear the singing of Pierce Brosnan (!), I can't see how this movie won't make it shameful . Definitely a movie that should never have been made and just if you missed it the first time, one I will never see again.
