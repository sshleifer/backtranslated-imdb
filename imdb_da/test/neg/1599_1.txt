This is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named Wirey Spindell from 8 to 36 years old, told in the story of the character at every age point in his life. So, for example, when he is eight, it is the eight-year-old voice that tells when he is in junior high it is the one who does the story, etc. It's about the only thing interesting about this movie. It seems that every actor playing Wirey is a distinct character. Not only do they not look, their life experiences don't seem to match up. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a bad cold.
