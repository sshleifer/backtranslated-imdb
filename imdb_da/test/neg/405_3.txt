36/100. This should not be confused with the decent Arachnophobia, this movie is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie. This one is so bad it actually has some entertainment value at that level. There are many unintentional (I think) laughing loudly scenes. I didn't expect much from the movie and it was actually worse than I imagined it would be. It is a clich√© that is ridden and predictable directly for video clutter. Fortunately, it doesn't take too much. As expected, the action is not entirely Oscar-caliber. The special effects are bad, worse than I would have thought they would be. Bad editing and the score is urgent.
