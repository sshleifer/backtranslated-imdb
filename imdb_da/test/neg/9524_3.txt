AKA <br /> <br /> Picture format: 3 x 1.78: 1 within 2.39: 1 frame (Triptych) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dolby Digital <br /> 1978 : A working class teenager (Matthew Leitch) takes on a fake identity and street crashes high society, learning hard lessons about the divisions between Rich and Poor. <br /> <br /> Autobiographical features of director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MIT LIFE ... YOUR FAULT), an exhibition of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, seen through the eyes of a low frequent "plain" whose worldview is transformed of his adventures among the top classes. Unfortunately, Roy's manuscript says very long that we didn't already know about the overrun of the idle man, and the story is only briefly ignited by Leit's relationship to a beautiful but self-destructive rental (Peter Youngblood Hills), which turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to imitate. Also starring in Diana Quick (as a scandalous snob who thinks people in the working class are "embarrassed to be alive"!), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("East Enders") , Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typical flamboyant cameo, flashing her breasts at all and diverse, without care in the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the movie's influence is diluted by Roy's insistence on using a Triptych effect (three separate 1,78: 1 images are letterboxed within the 2.39: 1 frame, each giving one second view on the individual scenes), which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on the screen. A long, pointless film that is too personal to great appeal, and constantly obstructed by a cinematic process that does not unite the story at hand. A single image version is also available (framed theatrical at 1.85: 1), with screen title AKA: LIES IS LIKE WISHING.
