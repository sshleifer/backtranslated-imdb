The only reason I bought this DVD is because Cynthia Rothrock is in it. Now everyone knows she is the queen of martial arts b-movies. The problem is that this is not a martial arts movie. Cynthia Rothrock has about a minute or so of battle scenes in this silly movie. Now if you were a film producer and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie, wouldn't you have a lot of martial arts action? all she does in this movie, walks around and bored just as i was when i looked at this pile of crap.i owns many of her movies and they are all b movies, but at least they had some cool fighting scenes in them. is a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what. I'm still sour I wasted 4 dollars to buy this DVD
