I just caught the "Wild Rebels" at one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" archive collections, and this movie was so bad, even though the MST3K crew couldn't make it entertaining. There are some MST3K "goals" that were movies whose concepts were so bleak that they might not have been good movies (like "The Green Slime") and others whose basic rooms could have been made into really entertaining movies, If their filmmakers didn't have you, they didn't bubble them in the performance. "Wild Rebels" is a film whose basic premise made a good movie three years earlier when Don Siegel directed his remake of "The Killers" at Universal. Both films are about a failed racing driver who is seduced by a femme fatale to drive the escape truck in a robbery that became the mastermind of the woman's boyfriend. Only in "The Killers" was the driver John Cassavetes, the woman was Angie Dickinson and the criminal mastermind (cast wildly but successfully against the type in what turned out to be his last movie) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are pretty comedown! But what really makes "Wild Rebels" a horrible movie is William Gref√©'s direction (note the accent on the final "e" present in his credit on the screen), which has absolutely no sense of pace and seems to leave everybody shots run at least half as long as it is needed to make its dramatic point. It's just a shame that someone didn't make a mocking comment on this movie now (in 2009); The comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairdresser and Rod Blagojevich would have been irresistible!
