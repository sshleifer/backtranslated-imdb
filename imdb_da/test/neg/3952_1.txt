A group of young adults open an escape for the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory as they recite their poem from a video game allegedly representing a soul. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg), who is also found dead in the same way as he died in video games. While the characters of the others did not die in the video game, their reciting poem has instead released video games into CGI characters who stalk and kill each one one by one. They must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this performance sounds stupid, it's because it is. The characters are ho-hum rejecting from bad WB TV shows, this time allowed to float profanity. This flick follows the rules but does not show much violence or doings. It remains PG-13 safe, with most of the off-screen deaths. There is a scene where the true hero and heroine runs from video game characters who pursue them. Yes, it's so bad. Nothing at all recommendable. Happy cast with Sophia Bush as the appropriately named October.
