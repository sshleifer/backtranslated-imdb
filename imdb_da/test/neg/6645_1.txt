I would not recommend this movie. Although it is rated G and is clear to children, there are quite a few swords (including the dreaded 'F' and 'S' words). This kind of language does not fall short of me, but in a children's film? Move on. There was also some implicit sexual content between one of the young young men and any willing adult woman who came with a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The play was as good as it gets in this genre of movie, but the story was very very cheesy, and even my four-year-old remarked that it was "stupid". <br /> <br /> Despite Elizabeth Shue, this movie is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.
