I saw the first 10 minutes of this show, I think I should barf now! A worst show on TV. It's not even fun. It's so boring, it's disgusting. I gave it another and third change couldn't even make it through five minutes. Don't waste your time. This is one of the many shows to go by. Talking about regular night time shows that should go. All shows at CBS. All shows on ABC. All shows at FOX and Joe Buck. All shows on the new CW network. All shows on NBC. (Accept The Law and Order series). All morning and afternoon talk shows. All court tv shows. And every reality shows out there !! Every stupid game show. period end! All home improvements show! And all the media news. all it is. It's a 24-hour loop of bad news. Yes, I have favorites Monk, the law and orders thats it for me.
