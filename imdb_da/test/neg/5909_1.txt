Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor join in this would be the comedy about night club owners being squeezed by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and instructed this unpleasant ego tour, and therefore has no one to blame but even for its failure. This is a really bad movie, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it only serves as an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be remarkably easy to continue turning on this movie, but I will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now.
