Even MST3K could not make this painful, long and ultimately mind-bending dragon fun or entertaining. While most bad movies in themselves are hilariously bad, this is one of the few videos that use the word badly in the literal sense. The element that makes this so horrible to see is not the lack of history, but the fact that SOOOO is very background is crammed in the first half hour, that it is completely ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving outside headlights. <br /> <br /> The movie's hero, Ator, is no more than eye-candy for this literary energy vacuum of a movie. Dressed in a linen and sporting "Pecs as melons", as Joel puts it, he hears more in a fitness magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this ONLY to die and I mean door-hard supporters of cheese. If you have an enemy, you can recommend them this movie. If you do this through this, I allow you. You should be able to do it through something.
