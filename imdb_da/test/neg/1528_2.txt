Where do I start with Killing Mind before I mention the good bit? This film is about a young psychologically profiling FBI woman, or something that for some reason goes to work for the LAPD for a while. There are some recognizable faces that "I love you, man" block from Wayne's World, play a policeman and also two guys who always seem to play cops, play ..... you guessed it, police officers. One of them was one of the police at Gross Point Blank after John Cusack about the place, and the other is the FBI guy with specs in Final Destination who is also in Fugitive as another policeman. I know the FBI, US Marshalls, CIA, etc. Not the police, but they are all the same. They enforce the law to some extent, making them police in my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of a policeman, whatever you want, they are still seen as those trying to bring down the evil guys. Anyone I give. The woman works with these policemen, who just seem to sit in a library in the basement or something and decide for some unknown reason to reopen a case that has not been investigated. She saw the dead body as a child, so of course she decided to reopen the case, so she was personally attached to it! I also like how the person who profiles the psychological state of others witness a murder scene as a child. It's probably the kind of thing that can screw anyone's head? She starts asking questions from a journalist who covered the story when it was open, although he seems to be the same age as the woman, so he probably either wrote to a newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote some School reports on it, and she decided that he would be the best person to ask about it. <br /> <br /> We see that, as well as reopening the murder case from 25 years earlier, she is trying her hand at small theft as some really scary ink sprints through a busy street wearing a balaclava. Way to mix, moron! Anyway, she and the police she is eating ice cream in the park, chasing after him, and while crossing a bridge with a woman and a child standing on it, the thief takes the child from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river. This, if you haven't already guessed, is the best bit of the movie. I'm not sadistic and have no hate for babies or anything, but the scene just looks so stupid, I promise you will wet your pants and laugh at it if you have to watch this movie. It gets better when the Chief of Final Destination & the Fugitive jumps in to rescue the child, then he declares to his friend "It's a Baby!" How did he know it before he jumped in, lying outside of me. She still chases after the thief, but loses him. Later she remembers that a random dog did not bark on the thief, so assumed that it should be his and decided to trace the thief through the dog. The dog had no marks or anything on it, so how she knew where to find the dog and thus find the thief is another question I do not want to go into. It was shortly after this that I stopped seeing. The story moved really slowly, and after I had stopped laughing at the baby's caste, I had lost some interest and missed what was said. <br /> <br /> I say I go further and assume the killer was the journalist because he seemed a little shiny and she ate a lot of time with him and anyone who sees Columbo knows that the person without For the police who spend most time with the investigator is your bad guy. Plus, others' reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. So all in all, a trouser profile, but worth seeing just for the one glorious scene.
