Cobb. It sucked. I learned nothing about the man I hadn't heard before. The performances were over the top. A scene where Cobb and Al drive down a snowy road in search of women in Reno must be one of the worst thought scenes in the latest memory. It's simple STUPID and unentertaining. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they used the same sequences above and over and over. If I saw the same shot of Cobb fighting with a person on a base once again, I would have been physically ill. By watching this 'movie' we learn nothing about how it was in the Cobb's era. We learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a leader, nothing about his relationship with his family members, except that "they do not like him". I thought when I sat down to watch this movie, I would learn something about the baseball time when Cobb played. Instead, everything I got to see was a story about how Cobb hated everything and everyone and how they hated him. Boy, what big movie (sarcasm calculated). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the movie, so which of his stories should be accurate? Who knows? So what? No one wants to see this piece of crap. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure that the rewind button on your VCR works as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully someday will make a good movie about Ty Cobb. I liked this movie about as much as the people in it liked Cobb, which is to say - I heard it. Now I know why I found it in the rent a section RENT A GET ONE FREE in the video store. I think I will ask for my fifty cents back from the video club as I can't get back the time I wasted so I looked at this trash. Oh yes, what could I have thought of a movie that would include Robert Wuhl.
