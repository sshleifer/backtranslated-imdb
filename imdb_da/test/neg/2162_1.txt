I got this movie from my uncle who had got it for free with a DVD magazine. It's easy to see why he was so eager to get rid of it. Now, I understand that this is a B-movie and that it doesn't have the same budget as larger movies, but they could have used their money better than doing that waste. There are some pretty good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (for example, die for example). This movie also contains the worst fight scene I've ever seen. The amount of nudity in the movie made it seem more like a porn movie than a Sci-Fi movie at times. Conclusion - Terrible movie
