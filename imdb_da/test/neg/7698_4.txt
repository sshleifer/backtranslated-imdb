These days, Ridley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and can control huge sums for helmet movies - especially since he has films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER for his credit. So from this partial list of his credits it is obvious that he is a great talent. But if you see this very early effort he made in the film school, you would probably have difficulty telling that he was destined for greatness. This is because even though it has some good camera work and style, the movie is hopelessly boring and uninvolving. Considering that it was not intended for general publishing, and it was only a training site, I am ready to look at it charitably - hence the score of 4. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is a part by CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. On this DVD are 16 shorts. Most are not big, but because it contains MAN without a head, copy, Rabat and WASP, it is a great DVD for lovers of short films and worth buying.
