What is it about mathematical geniuses that make the critics float juice? A beautiful memory was not too much in my opinion (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved Oscar that year), while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several prizes outdone on the undeserved <br /> <br /> The first time is the script. When I attended the film school I was told that GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example of how not to start a script and the supervisor was right. This film lacks any kind of opening hook and for the most part it is very very slow. If you wrote an unsolicited script like this, the script readers would have given it up on page 15 <br /> <br /> The structure away from the idea of ​​a member of the American subclass is that some kind of intellectual God doesn't really call right. Ask yourself this: If he is the smartest character in the movie, how does he get through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Not a single childhood teacher noticed his gift? Very unlikely, as the fact that he is reading so much mind to expand the literature. And if it will be so wise, how does he get so ignorant of what happens to young looking boys in American prisons? <br /> <br /> But that's the casting that leaves much of the movie down. Want to get a couple of actors to play hard hard Irish gang members? Let's get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who are like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal gooder. I was not convinced by the sinister mouth of Damon and Affleck when they stroked to sneak people in the chops and could not think that even though they wrote the script, the parts should have been assigned to different actors, after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screens movies he has not been cast in and the same criteria should have been used here <br /> <br /> There are some good points to the movie. Robin Williams is excellent as the man trying to show. Will his potential and also very well be Stellan Skarsgard, who is quite simply one of the greatest character players to step in outside Europe, and despite my earlier criticism of the script, there is quite a movement of dialogue in the park as Williams character explains to Will he seen in life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are less pluses than negatives to this movie, and I have to agree with the people who have said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and convincing
