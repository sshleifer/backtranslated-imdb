The most annoying thing about "Dies d'agost" (August Days) is not just that nothing happens in this movie, but director Marc Recha has fun pretending that this film is a kind of tribute to the leftist Catalan journalist Ramon Barnils. Unless Barnil's name a couple of times constitutes a "tribute", this notion is a complete scam. You will learn almost nothing about Barnils in this movie or about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) or about Catalonia's special role in that war. You also won't learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic Catalan people for years by the victorious and victorious Franco. <br /> <br /> The film on the Catalan landscape is very beautiful of course, but "Dies d 'agost" does not have a comprehensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travel book. is shown - not much illumination of images of the forest floor, for example - is the clearest indication of the idea of ​​ideas here.The effortless operation of the brothers Marc and David during their camping trip does not produce convincing cinema. and for the space of medieval hippies. Don't waste your time. Read a good book about the Spanish Civil War instead. ) Barry Freed
