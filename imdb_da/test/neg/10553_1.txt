What can I say? This was a horrible movie to watch. I am usually not very critical of homosexuals in general, because most people are usually low budget, but they really shot me on the wall. I think this had happened to gay people? Didn't gay producers and directors learn anything from Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee's films? Just having to sit through the whole movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted. I continued to ask for moments where I would feel any connection with any of the characters, but it never happened. Most of the characters' performances were just not very convincing. It was like watching one of the poorly produced TV specials on TV stations. I can't tell you how much disappointed. It was watching this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spelling's other works and the directors last work on "Latter-day Saints". It was definitely not worth the wait. Absolutely, a couple of hours in my life I will never come back and will certainly not buy it on DVD.
