.. but unfortunately nobody thought about having the van killed to save this convicted production. The only positive thing about him in the movie is his good singing voice ... too bad the songs are most mind-boggling and juicy. Why did I hate so much? All through the film, he thought he made a three-dimensional Soupy Sales imitation - with lots of shaking, bad jokes and too much energy used to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he "taught" the class - these kids laughed at everything he did. Heck, Van could have read the phone book or shown them autopsy photos and they would probably laugh! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the movie - he was just the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) playing an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother !! The bottom line is that because of these crazy options, the movie was judged from the start .... and the worst of them was the God-fearing Bobby Van. Now, in fact, he may have been a lovely person, and it is boring that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here, I would just tear the tongue out to make him quiet . <Br /> <br /> Now I also mentioned the songs - egad, the terrible songs !! The original SOLID HORIZON by Frank Capra was a strange joy all the time - and not a single song and dance song in the movie. So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that didn't do anything to help the movie? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess - just like the original doctor DOOLITTLE combined with lost horizons. The end result is a sickly sweet children's movie - not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8. <br /> <br /> Now if you can remove these problems, you have the foundation for a decent movie. After all, the plot is lovely and is still hidden under all goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (although it is not Ronald Colmans just in original). But considering that the original was an almost perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade through the drawbar? <br /> <br /> This movie was included in "The 50 Worst Films" book by Harry Medved. While I also didn't like the movie, it wasn't bad enough to tell the inclusion in the book. I think it was included, mostly because it was such a big cash table error and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book - just not one of the best choices for "hallowed hall" of drunk.
