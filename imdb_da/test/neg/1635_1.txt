I actually own this movie, which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers" which is really the only way to really see a movie like this. If it wasn't for Joel, Crow and Tom Servo constantly doing wisecracks, it would not be possible to sit through this piece of shit. You have a hero called Ator, which looks like Jeff Spigoli in the Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and appears a little more intelligent, just without being stoned. He takes on the cavemen (cave-dwellers?) Invisible guys, a giant snake (with a bunch of anal-restraining snakes that like to straighten up all the skulls in the same way), discovering a henchman who looks suspiciously like a modern aluminum with some cheap vines wrapped around it, and then battling with the evil Johnsaxian-looking guy. Then he rides on the horse over the deck tracks where someone has been four-wheeled. Yes, I got most of it from MST3K, as I said is the only way to watch this turkey from a movie. If it wasn't for that, it would get zero stars.
