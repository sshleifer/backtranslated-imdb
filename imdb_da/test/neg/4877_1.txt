Where do I start. Let's list the good things about this movie first. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as Gangster Thomas. This is the only sign you will actually care about and he is a bad guy! (Allthogh never does anything bad and is generally a beautiful looking guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always fantastic. He is a little toned here, but he is still fun 3. The film looked good from Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and light. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad. This is by far the worst script to make it the big screen ever. The action of everyone else was pretty poor and over the top. The direction was horrible. A completely pointless story, completely unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours long. During emotional scenes, almost everyone laughed at the theater. People just started going out during the screening. <br /> <br /> There is no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent, so I won't even try. Every clich√© ever perceived is in there and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. <br /> <br /> Look for a good laugh, but try not to pay any money for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
