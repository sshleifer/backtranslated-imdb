Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerent crazy athlete to live. His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and sheer violence. Every game he recorded was a play in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film is about him not about anything, but focuses on writing his biography of author Al Stump. Now, it's not such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as the years progressed, and the stories of his outrageous outbursts, even as seniors, are shocking even by today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on these events, which I think were simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo-fictional film with clichéd a clichéd plot that will cause any knowledgeable Cobb fan to weep vineyards. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones does well as a crotchety Cobb, but somehow manages to overlap his cartoon supervillainy. Most stories about Cobb are hardly credible, but to make him more crazy, it seems both impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, depicting the author Al Stump, is a dark swirl of non-existent talent. He sucks life out of every scene and tries to make this movie his own Nagasaki. There is a reason why we never see him as a leading man anymore (Arliss doesn't count. It's hardly a show). Even the elusive, inevitable "rollover" of Cobb and Stump at the end gets even worse with his sheer inability to pronounce words that do not sound like a bad book on tape storytelling. <br /> <br /> For all the terrible writing and intense filmmaking on the display, there is a sequence that stands out so much better than the rest of this failure that acceptance of it is from the same movie is almost impossible. A hyper-styled flashback sequence that shows Cobb's overwhelming psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing baseball games is pure shine. The camera moves in bizarre fashion, and the whole event seems like a dream because of the unique gameplay of the Cobb monster. Each slide, hit and tackle is made even more powerful due to improved sound, and the Tommy Lee Jones OWNS intensity of the master player. It makes the viewer sad about the possibilities for a true biopic of Cobb in his prime with the same actor. It's worth watching the movie in this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what might have been. <br /> <br /> I may be a little unfair to this movie because of my own knowledge of Ty Cobb and want it to be something, it's not, but to make such boring, neutralized film about this Maniac is unwise. I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has worn since.
