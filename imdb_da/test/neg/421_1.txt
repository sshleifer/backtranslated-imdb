It's hard to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel "Angels and Demons" could misfire as badly as this movie version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Due to the spoilers, do not read on unless you have already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) In the film there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Even worse, there was not even a chemistry between the two leading players. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking places in Rome, as described in the novel, were not visually realized in the film. I realize that director Ron Howard had trouble filming on the spot. But there are superior photographed depictions of Rome on The History Channel, than in this movie, where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock footage. The great works of art described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of "Ecstasy of St. Teresa" was only instantly glinted, and the West Ponente relief in the Vatican's space was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The most tasteless choice of filmmaker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the short story, the Pope is obviously fictitious with no resemblance to any real Pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the novel's most colorful (and important) characters, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was cut out of the manuscript. <br /> <br /> (5) There were many instances where the dialogue lines were inaudible due to foreign background noise. <br /> <br /> There were moments when faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. This technique worked in "The Godfather" movies, but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The College of Cardinals was quite a modley crew with one of the electricians talking in a southern drawl. This guy would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The crucial relationship between Camerlengo and the deceased pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the short story Hassassin's character was an unforgettable villain. In the film, this assassin's role was a cutting-edge man. <br /> <br /> (10) The filmmakers did not rely on the effects of the successful romance. <br /> <br /> In the short story, Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber.
