The DEA agent's name, Anslings, is a good interior joke - it's the name of the former drug csar that has almost simply made marijuana illegally. <br /> <br /> Despite this bit of literature, the authors continue to get farmers to pick up and sell fresh wonder leaves, rather than cure buds. Besides, I always find it fun that filmmakers never seem to be able to find real marijuana plants for movie recording. You would think there would be a business that would make real-life fake film, or maybe they could shoot a few scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I suppose it is asking too much for the budget. Probably the most interesting thing about the movie is the attempt to cover the notion of what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law behaves and yet tries to do justice despite it. <br /> <br />
