"An evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the Louvre Museum" that's all I think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself! As I think it is one of the worst French or non-French films ever made in the history of the cinema! <br /> <br /> Nothing good here except the music (only of the credits!), some sore moments of (Sophie Marceau) and of course the movie's final shot .. Not because it ends in the age of what seemed to be a myriad years of seeing this CRAP, but also as perfect as a magical CGI work that was too good to be true in here! <br /> <br /> In this way, I will change the plot summary to be like this: "An evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make miserable movies". Like this one, it's safe.
