[Warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, including the most important one that comes across his girl friend vs.quickly dead (but that's OK while he is running up with one prostitute from the casino he is working on). The main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who is being drawn on a fraud, constantly running his monologue of the book he writes. I cannot say that I would buy the book, perhaps a much better assumption would have been if the voice-over (which annoyingly cuts in to tell a bit of the movie you might not have understood through his book) would have had 52 different personnel ... to represent each card in the deck, but I give up. In the end, there was a twist where the protagonist has been set up by someone close to him, but since I didn't like his character so much at this point (I found it impossible to like anyone in this movie, the characters are all one-dimensional zombies ), which I really didn't care about, and was glad the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Plus point: The English actress from ER makes a risky South African accent Minus point: An annoying movie
