"R Xmas" looks into the life of a middle-class married-with-kid family of drug distributors during the Christmas holidays. There is no story here - just an irreconcilable collection of events. Ferrara appears to be at the juxtaposition of the holiday and home life with drug peddling in NYC, jumping back and forth between each. The players seem to be improving and adlibiting now and then for a compelling watch. Overall, a bad effort not worth the time. (D)
