I managed to see this on what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after the opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While attending another movie two nights later at the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast & crew on another promotional screening of Studs. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the movie, I didn't expect a masterpiece at all, but what I was presented with, I think lacked all the essentials of the genre it had put into it Before I continue two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to undermine generic expectations, this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know that it was based on a game (which I have not read, but has been informed that it is not a shiny piece of literature), but it does not apologize for the massive narrative problems that pervade the film. /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the script, forgetting that it was based on a game as a sports comedy, it simply does not work, down and out the team is trying to win a football cake, few of the games appear (when they are , it is very short) and we do not get any satisfaction because of their sporting performance. After reading so far you can assume that it is not a strict sports film, but a psychological examination of the relationship between a "charlatan" of a leader and his hopeless team. It certainly does not achieve this, I am not even sure if it was meant to. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Overall, I found the script missing in many respects. <br /> <br /> I think the performance and music was good and technical, the film was well made. But apart from the points expected from an Irish movie at this stage, I left the theater that felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My assessment may seem tough, but I think there is hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future, and this simply does not back that argument. Since Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld movie (I was part of the audience at this screening), most would seem to disagree with me, so that means you're likely to make your own rating of the movie.
