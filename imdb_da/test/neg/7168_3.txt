Oh God! Book II is more a poor remake of the original than a successor to it. It's not that fun, its plot plays too much <br /> <br /> as a rejected comedy pilot, and the use of the slogan "Think God" is another variant of the idea that worked so much better in the original. John Denver had not returned to this movie and it made a big difference. George Burns, who <br /> <br /> wonderful as he played God, does not have the same chemistry with the little girl he did with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> George Burns, the rest of the casting is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved the first one, don't bother seeing this one.
