Despite having a horrible script (more on that later), this movie is still vaguely watched just because it originates two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Apart from one or two REAL stinkers, I will probably see almost everything with them in the movie, as I am a big fan of Hollywood's golden age from the 1930s and 40s. But no matter how much I love their movie, I just can't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resorts. The two have not yet met, but the film begins loud and uncomfortable with a scene where Fonda shudders evenly during skiing. It was done so effortlessly and got my teeth sanded, but I laid it out - especially since Fonda fell into a snow bank and it stopped yodeling !! In retrospect I may have just turned it off! Fonda is out in the fall and Barbara is looking for help. Back at the ski lodge, he seems okay, but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x-ray and nurses back to health. He is again thrilled with her and suggests her. Despite the fact that they hardly know each other, they are married and so far the movie looks like a sweet but very small romantic comedy. But at home, it is not rosy as she jumps straight back into her job as a family doctor, and he begins to show signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man because of his envy. The film is all about fun, but frankly, Fonda's behavior was really scary - spied on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening any man she treats, stumbling a patient who already has back injuries and stomping into a surprise party and insisting There (men and women) are out to steal their wife away. He comes out as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but everyone must be laughing. Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut, you would think Stanwyck would file a cancellation with a detention order! But strangely, she gets angry, but just can't be mad at Fonda, because he's so ........? I can't think of the right word - "scary" is all that comes to mind !!! Later out of the blue, several millionaires receive Fonda a job that works the counter at a department store. Then, through magic thinking, he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy are all a past - so a job obviously hardenes anger and suspicions. When this job falls through, the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital and giving Barbara a job there and they happily ever live. They do not go on with the story, but I assume Fonda's character that he then spent most of his time as a hospital administrator and beat up all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part of the ski lodge and the next didn't fit well, and the final "Horatio Alger" did not inspire the section where the rich boy did well in business. They were like three separate plots, but it was the most serious problem with the movie that it seemed to excuse domestic violence and misleading jealousy! What a scary little movie! Thousand, neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this horror movie, but for all their other lovely films.
