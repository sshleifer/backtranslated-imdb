Let me be clear. I hate these kind of movies. I don't like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeois English. I find this kind of literature and movies terribly pretentious. You will never make me read a Jane Austen book on purpose. That said, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and saw the subsequent movie is to a class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful English woman living in a borrowed villa in Florence before World War II. One night after eating with some of her rich royal related friends, she willingly picks up an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then kills himself. As the movie becomes more and more, you really don't like Mary. <br /> <br /> What a load of scream this movie was. First of all, there were many subplots and characters invented in the film that were not even in the book. I very much doubt that the late Mr Maugham would have appreciated them. The characters, though wealthy, were some of the most superficial and self-centered people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it anything less than three stars was because the play was the only one redeemed. The always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for Mary's role. In fact, I couldn't see anyone else filling her shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had roles that were as good as the lead. Save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
