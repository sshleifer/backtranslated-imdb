If you saw Atlantis 1 then you would know that what made the movie really good was brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was so dull and animated. The story is also drowsy. I was so disappointed with this half-baked drivel that I couldn't pass it by the first hour and MAN I tried! The only thing this movie had was that it extended the "mole" character, making him both more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take it from me, rate this junk from the cover of the video box. The deck is badly drawn Disney schlock, clearly grasped for an easy money from an unsuspecting parent. If this was a standalone flick, it wouldn't be that bad, but driving on a coattails of a glorious piece like Atlantis makes it absolutely indestructible.
