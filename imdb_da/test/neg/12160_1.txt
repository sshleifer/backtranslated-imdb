Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar list. The most sad thing is: <br /> <br /> 1. It is very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Ghengis khan, cruel and mighty emperor in Asia be played by some kind of good actor with warm and lovely eyes - throughout the film except a scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spends 20 years between his childhood and mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or at home. Click! - In the next second, he leads the great army, without reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Ghengis-khan is explained only by a wolf / god / who it was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man love his wife when she hasn't seen her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the sword fight if you just ride your horse through enemy lines, sit there with two swords, and all die around you die? Does Ridley Scott know that way? <br /> <br /> 7. Why does the 20-year-old's mother not look older? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the protagonist? (None. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Really. The work of the cinematographers is good; nature is excellent - but the film cannot be made without an instructor and script. The real Ghengis khan would perform a second for a second. Yours sincerely.
