This film was released in the UK under the name of Blood Rites. It was banned completely and never sent again for release. <br /> <br /> Like The Ghastly Ones, it was apparently a hit with the terrible hungry citizens of New York City's famous 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit. If you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this movie. Unfortunately, you should see the developmental colin (Hal Borske) chomp down on a live rabbit chuckled 16mm camera work that makes Ed Wood look positive. <br /> <br /> Three sisters should spend three days in the family home with their husbands before the old man's money is paid. Of course, in such a situation one begins to lose death. Family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled, especially during a cruel dismemberment. Maybe it was the rabbit bit that the British protested against, I know I did.
