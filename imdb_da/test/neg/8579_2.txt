I participated in a screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, I have to tell you without any ax to paint that this movie is unimaginably invisible. The very courageous and sincere performances of William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been terribly upgraded to what is probably the least polished, most clich√© script that has received the green light this year. I don't know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure it couldn't reach the Dante style depths that this one did. As brave as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing that the otherwise brilliant actors did, was to surrender to such a horrible instructor and scary manuscript. He should be pitched pretty well on the board because he should never be allowed to be within a hundred yards of a camera. The dialogue is so embarrassed and lumpy that I actually found myself blushing during the screening. I have been murdered that Macy's talents have been completely wasted in the hands of one whose direction is as incompetent as his writing. <br /> <br /> Looking at talented actors like Alec Baldwin's work through Kramer's scary script and him-fisted direction was akin to seeing a baby sealant get lumpy - I felt angry, helpless and sick at the same time. Although I am always happy that there are investors and industry people who are willing to take risks on distinctive scripts with interesting premises, this image was a complete, complete failure. Kramer could not have been more cruel to these actors if he himself had taken a steel tube on his knees. I hope for their sake, they can all avoid similar humiliation in the future. Macy wisely knocked out the side door and didn't even hold onto the screen. Unfortunately, it seems that the main character's disadvantage has rubbed the picture in the worst possible way. Anyone who is accustomed to quality independent will probably find it totally unbearable.
