I was actually looking forward to this movie. The advertisements made it look really cool and action-packed. And I heard that Claire Daines' character was arrested for assault, so I thought she would kick a lot of ass and that would be cool. BUT NOOOOOOOO !!. Their was hardly any action at all, and the sign was quite sweet. The only saving grace was Omar Epps and even he didn't help the movie much.
