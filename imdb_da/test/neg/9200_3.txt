I really enjoyed the movie. It was sometimes really cheesy. (They destroy the villain with hairdryers - but where are they connected?) However, it is a unique movie and I enjoy the play by Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also enjoyed Fanuel (but you write it ...) like Megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb. Besides the play, "rewinding" and showing what happened at Ariel and then Megan's point of view was quite interesting. I saw it twice and I would see it again
