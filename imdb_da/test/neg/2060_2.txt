This film is of interest to fans of the famous rock band "The Band" in that the singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. It seems that the film may have been shot some years before 75, judged by Richard's appearance. Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a significantly better movie "Coal Miner's Daughter." Anyway, you really need a special reason to leave this hard to see art movie. Unfortunately, the famous sensitive Manuel would commit suicide. I never heard how he ended up in a movie. Four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad movie "Man Outside."
