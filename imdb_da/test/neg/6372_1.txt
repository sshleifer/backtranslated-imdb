I have been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 70's and have always enjoyed the character, which is far from the average pure cut hero and his many and varied enemies. There has been no less than three attempts at an animated series for Iron Man, and only the original and part of the other have ever done the justice of the character. So I was a little hopeful that this latest version would be good. Boy was I wrong! DVD art is very misleading and presents a picture that is not the movie. Fist off the good, how little is there ... Art and animation are well drawn and writing and dialogue are generally good, though with remarkable exceptions. Character voices are very well-chosen and each character is distinctive and well-acted. Now for the bad ... Unfortunately, the authors have chosen to completely align with both Iron Man's origin and especially Mandarin's. In addition, they decided to make Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI. Poor CGI. This makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon. The CG work is often repeated and clear shortcuts are sometimes taken. The CG fights are also clumsy, further enhancing the fact that CG and line animation do not mix well. The movie would certainly have gone better if they chose to actually draw all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional Red and Gold suit for every ONE match! And it's not even the big fight at the end. All this pulls the film down and it never fetches. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) MUST FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an interesting unusual stop movement sequence for machines, welding and gear. Then we are introduced to what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as Mandarin. Things go strange and prevent progress in restoring the temple. Monitoring is James Rhodes, Tony's long friend. In fact, they seem to plan to raise the temple from the ground, despite opposition from a group that insists on raising the temple will cause a terrible disaster. Rhodes is trapped in a raid. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is briefed on the problems and personally sets out to monitor the project and save his friend while acting in the background with the father who is pushing for Tony to be removed. Tony comes only to get his armored escort back and blow in pieces. Tony later raises the deadly wound in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. He is only saved by quick action from Rhodes and a scientist. Finally, Stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and make a good escape, but only after some loss of life. As he meets the rebels, he meets a troubled girl named Li Mei, and the two fall in love. The temple is upright and four elemental beings (all finished in CG) appear and continue to collect hidden powers. Strong and Rhody finds trouble at home but manages to confront the elementals unsuccessfully to stop them, first by using Aquatic Armor, then the more classic Red and Gold Armor and finally returning everything to the temple, and Stark is back in the great gray armor for a final showdown and one ran into what may be Fine Fang Foom (also in the CG.) Here the story takes a great twist, as it turns out that Mandarin needs a host to manifest. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle horrified by the fact that Mandarin is slightly more than a ghost and not seen until the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh ... <br /> If you are an Iron Man fan, you probably will not enjoy this excursion. And even non-fans may well find the movie something missing or not.
