With a title like that, you'll be forgiven for thinking about this movie is about the great painter, Goya. Then, after more than half an hour, you decide on the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even greater width, it may be just a snapshot. With lurid characterization, too many axes to paint and little consideration of facts, Milos Forman sets up a colorful, but shambolic, wandering mish mash that fails on all three accounts. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps) is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. Won awards for it. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of different, repulsive regimes, especially communism. He also did just over-the-top but quite impressive, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. So when he is 74 years old, how does he come to offer us this mess? In Goya's Ghosts, Goya is a step removed from buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, passionately acted by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is as vibrant as Goy's model Ines (and later in the movie, her own daughter). The heavy connection with Goya is that he happens to paint them both. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo torture (and then rape) Ines, whom he supposed to be a Jew. Her father tortures Lorenzo. Napoleon strikes in order to free Spain (map). Ines comes out of the dungeon, the Church has left her in search of her child. Goya still paints, but has gone deaf. His biggest concern seems to be helping Ines. Etc. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. When Forman unfortunately rejected the idea of ​​a biopic of the Goya painter, this one circumstance could have been used to pull the whole movie together? a great piece of history as seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. Similarly, a document of the Inquisition Terrors must be made? Compared to other despotic orders all the time, the Holy Lake has been forgiven with hardly any confession. Although one might ask if Forman is competent enough to trust an actual account of something. <br /> <br /> "I thought it might be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too heavy to keep our attention. Based on our expectations and with the background of something greater (the life of a great painter, the atrocities of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in a conjunctive (if kind) infatuation with Goya's. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The background detail is dealt with terribly. Goya became deaf in 1792 (when the movie starts), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as credible as a cut from a grain package. We see that the church expires a death sentence (when the normal procedure was for the church to insist that the secular arm did the dirty work). Fighting looks too choreographed and sceney. A pepper of gratuitous naked breast hardly does it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, production values ​​are mostly good. The colors are alive, pacing excellent (at least until we stop finding any worthy history.) Bardem is excellent and Portman is a joy until she goes into exaggeration like a sour woman. Although it does not say much about Goya, it is good, though superficial and rather irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I once had a sennat drunken conversation where my friends and I asked each other if you could choose a director to portray your life, who would it be? On his record, Forman would unfortunately be at the bottom of my list.
