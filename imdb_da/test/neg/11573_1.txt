Within the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I was in favor of one of those "pick at the errors" kinda movies. The play was terrible, the script was even worse. Who ever let these people write, writes such a shit for a movie to feed Komodos himself. With Russian Mig jets that make up American airborne rays and guns that can miraculously shoot 50-60 rounds of quick fire without reloading are bad details for any story. In a scene, Komodo kills special forces troops at night while in another explains how komodos and cobras are cold blooded and do not come out at night !!!! Also with amazing special effects available in today's film industry, they were only average even for this low budget film. <br /> <br /> All that was said, I finally saw it curious about what others were wondering about bad movie production could produce. Shame Shame Shame, to produce such a mess !!! <br /> <br /> This movie should have been left on the rocky floor !!!
