This movie was really stupid and I thought it wasn't that bad and I could tolerate a movie about a bed that ate people. Then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being cherry on a bad movie. I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness. The brother was still alive and moving when his hands were just bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands that just wasn't right. Without muscles, you really can't move your hands, but he did. The brother should have died softly even before he moved his hands. The movie wasn't great, but it was okay until the hand scene. I laughed so hard that I didn't really remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something.
