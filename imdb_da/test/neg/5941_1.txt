I loved this movie! It is the finest parody of Russian cinema to date. Who else than Sokurov could make Tarkovsky so great. You thought "Stalker" was slow? Well, go up to the plate. "Food in Syn" makes "Stalker" look like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". In no way should you miss this movie! There is no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this movie fully by holding the forward button on your VCR. Sokurov has given us the first feature length movie that can be appreciated in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I suppose the next great masterpiece of the form comes when someone has the vision and the courage to exhibit a movie consisting of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black silent screen (was this not already explored in "In The Soup"?). The filmmaker (and the fans) seems to have forgotten that "exercise" is the first word of "motion picture". <br /> <br /> !!! GREAT SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> Do you want to reach the heights of genius this movie achieved? Here's a step by step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some topics and a suitable picturesque landscape (think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, see some luxury car or perfume advertising. <br /> <br /> 3. Shoot approx. 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results to play around with saturation, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now you just need to get out of your movie camera, film 40 of the best pictures and get your "actors" mumble their lines off-screen. Don't worry about writing it in advance - let the actors say what they want (lines like "Do you want a drink?" And "Let's get something to eat" is really all you need to fill 8 minutes or so ). If you can't think of enough dialogue - no problem! Just get them to repeat what they say a couple of times. If it's still not enough, let the camera run anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! The static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpeg coding - a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality level.
