Really flatulent script and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer to agree on it. <br /> <br /> I actually went out of the theater about 15-20 minutes into it and demanded my money back. I've actually gone out of a movie just 3 times in my life (I'm 43 years old), and that's the only one who made me sad enough to claim my fare back. If I could have, I would have got a refund for popcorn too. This was a really miserable movie and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> For one thing, how does someone who was brought up as a pre-tech barber learn to drive a car? In California !!! (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill, and in California, even tricks ... I should know I live there.)
