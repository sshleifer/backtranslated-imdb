I give it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history. A full-length movie made by high school students! It also shows, but it is part of the charm and appeal. Get hold of some of the things George Lucas did at UCLA; this is better. Maybe because of being a group effort. A monster of toxic waste and too much waste - these kids were ahead of their time! - begins to destroy the city of Milpitas during a high school dance. The monster accidentally destroys and leaves waste and smelly footprints. <br /> <br /> The movie has local television and radio characters, the Milpitas mayor, Samuel Ayer High School principal and a whole bunch of high school students and their parents, not to mention the mayor's daughter as indoors. <br /> <br /> Stupid? Yeah! Fun? Yeah! Great screen writing? C'mon, they are untrained high schoolies! Copy the comment to the play, filmography, directing, et cetera. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is located right next to San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley; maybe one of the graphic geniuses that will update the video somehow. Now there is a challenge.
