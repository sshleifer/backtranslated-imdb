Such a highly anticipated remake of a beloved musical classic and such a bitter pill it had to take. Very, very hard to swallow ... all of it. It didn't have an ounce of credibility anywhere. And when you don't have a Rose, you don't have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seemed born to play this part. Yet she could only produce was a sweet, fun, glittering brand Bette Midler ... balanced with all the well-known means. Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave, knowing she is still the final Mama Rose (at least in movies). I thought Midler would really put it across this time ... throwing himself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... as she did in "The Rose". But no, she played it safely. She played herself. She made Rose a total cartoon comic. Even her songs were uninspired. It was a pity to see that Means has the ability to rise above her money-making schtick. She only showed law once in this "gypsy" and it was with "Rose's Turn". But then it was too little, too late. A sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark, and when Gypsy's role erodes it from Rose, you know there are problems in River City. <br /> <br /> A big, big downhill.
