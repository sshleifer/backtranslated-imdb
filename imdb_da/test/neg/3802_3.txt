Perhaps here in Sydney we are all jaws down and as a result we will run up floats like this s-eek! -Well in classic theaters. Released here in 1980, this hilarious all-tar drama was greeted with joy at the session I attended. In fact, the audience looked into the ridiculous antics on the screen that played as a Rocky Horror session. Within 5 minutes we all knew that it was a real disaster: the tugboat scene where you can see the buckets of water thrown in from the offset. after that it was every protector for himself and the cinema advised, cheering for bad plays and oo-waah reactions. The war battle in the chamber between the boxes is particularly idiotic and gives drunk viewers with friends in changed states and also looks to contribute properly. I call these movies with Michael Caine his holiday movie, as I always think he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to use his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.
