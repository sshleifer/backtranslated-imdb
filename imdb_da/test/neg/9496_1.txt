I have never felt the need to add a review to this site so far, but right after I passed through the movie, I felt the need to warn parents who might be thinking of showing it to their children. Please don't! This is no Disney movie. This movie tells us that life is cruel, and if you show it to your children, you are, in my opinion, too. <br /> <br /> The video box describes the movie as a "joy for all ages" and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a "family movie". I had to find a definition of 'family movie' and came across the following: "These movies are usually based on comedies or adventures. These films are often based on children's literature and may involve a number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds. , all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination. Regardless of the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is taught on the road. and an ending that qualifies the movie as a "bad movie". The lesson learned? As I said, life is cruel. Family entertainment? I do not think. Unless you hate your family, it is. <br /> <br /> Another review, more revealing than this, but worth reading, can be found by following the "external reviews" link.
