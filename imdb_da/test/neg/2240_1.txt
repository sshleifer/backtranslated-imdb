Quentin, in my opinion, has only written and directed a really good movie, and that was the many award-winning Pulp Fiction. However, most of the movies, especially of recent times, have been real REAL turkeys. People still consider him and his stuff today and I really can't see why. There are many other directors and writers who today produce much better entertainment in every aspect of their movie. From this point on I will not believe in the hype that is a Tarantino movie. <br /> <br /> Inglorious was too long and worse still you felt. The humor was, yes, minimal and not so humorous. The violence was nothing new (minus the end scene). The dialogue was sometimes very much drawn. <br /> <br /> For some, they will love this movie; and for others they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought the subject of Nazis was finally put in bed with the amazing 2004 German film Der Untergang.
