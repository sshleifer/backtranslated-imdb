The only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available. This show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap. I tried to support this show in its decline because I like people's interests stories and Primetime used to have some very good ones. Unfortunately, April 21, has changed my mind about this show and the unethical news that is taking part in it. In fact, ABC recorded a brutal case of child abuse and refused to show it until the law of limitations had ceased and parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have made. What made it worse was how ABC swept the whole incident under the blanket; Instead of taking responsibility and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals, some popologists had sent strict warnings to the revelation of how they should not judge these poor angels too hard. I was really sick. I hope this review will stop someone from seeing this exploration waste in the future. If it does, I'll be happy. Today, everything you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good people from Primetime Live, is butt-kissing sessions with A-list celebrities and criminal acts covered and praised to the stars. Don't waste your life time; You'd rather see an old sitcom on Nick at Nite.
