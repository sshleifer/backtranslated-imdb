A couple are separated during a holiday. Early scenes lead us to believe that Barney's character, Jeff Bridges, has kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable but biased abduction. The film plays a few years later, when Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland), despite a new love interest, is determined to resolve her disappearance. The storylin is certainly exciting, but there have been some really bad decisions made during the production of this film, culminating in a beautifully scary work. <br /> <br /> OK here we go. The abduction scene - apart from two major continuity errors, is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are made to perform a small signed-pet-love ritual that has drowned in over-sentimentality to nausea. We know they are in love; "I solemnly swear never to leave you" talk only moments earlier was abundant thanks. Jeff Bridges' robot accent is another example. What is it for? Starman is back, and it works after a decade on the planet, he got lost. The whole plot can then be solved by the introduction of a superfluous character, which by quite a fortune has quite miraculous forces for observation. The climaxic sequence has been essentially performed before much, much better. It is riddled with additional irritations and another dazzling continuity blunder. I could go on, but something positive should be said. On a stretch, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one who saves face with a fairly decent performance. The 1988 original with the same name (changed from the Dutch title 'Spoorloos' to the English speaking audience) was recommended to me, only for an online rental company to send me this later Hollywood version by mistake. I was surprised to find that both were directed by George Sluizer and would be interested in knowing his motivation for remake. I am reliable and thankfully informed that it has a much higher quality in all areas, including plot. Horah for that, but it doesn't take much to do.
