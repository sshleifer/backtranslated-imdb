When George Sluizer was told he could lead an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei" / film "Spoorloos" (outside the Netherlands, this film also has the name "Vanishing"), he was told that this would only Go through if the end was changed - he was told that 'the US audience' would not approve the original termination. Of course, the original ending is much better and without it the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I will not give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. To know the original ending, see "Spoorloos" or read the book. This movie is absolutely rubbish and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I don't like. See the original Dutch film, which is one of the world's best thrillers.
