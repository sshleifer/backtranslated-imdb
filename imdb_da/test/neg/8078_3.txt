A bunch of teenage dirt cyclists are out in the woods who are circling. They have a little fun knowing that nature is being released by an emo refugee from a Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes movie. He is armed with fighting and fires accellerant. And he has an eye that is bleeding or something. Why burn a park? I do not know. Maybe he doesn't like Smokey the Bear or anything. But he carries army / navy great fatigue if it helps. <br /> <br /> Rangers send a single helicopter to fight the resulting fire; It's all you ever see except a bunch of people in a base somewhere that speaks a lot about the fire, but does nothing. Some police officers or ranger or militia or whatever he drops from the helicopter on a defective tether. <br /> <br /> Everyone now rides their dirt bikes as they audition for motocross. They forever pop wheelies, jump Evel Knievel, spin around etc. They argue incessantly. Shots of the fire are as false as a $ 3 bill; It is the same recording from a dozen different angles, and the bladder never grows or moves. And you still see no fire fighting equipment. <br /> <br /> SyFy channel films have about 0% science fiction attached to it. What to expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects and a story that goes nowhere (like the bikes and the fire goes nowhere). Laughable insomniac cure.
