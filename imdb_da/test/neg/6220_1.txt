Having watched this movie, I have decided that it is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. I knew the moment when I was exposed to three teenage girls screaming and passing when they (OMG!) Meet again and then look the same, only made by women who were old enough to be my mother. And it was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + ridiculous dance movements complete with hip guns and over top suits = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag. Nor could anyone else in this pile of explosion be practical. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, key, in the incredibly designed and STUPID plot. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I was either cringing or laughing at the movie. And I really like movie musicals. Of course, they are bound to be a little corny ... but that was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I think you have good actors and actresses in this movie ... I'm embarrassed by them that this is now part of their career. I'm sorry to waste my money and time on this piece of shit.
