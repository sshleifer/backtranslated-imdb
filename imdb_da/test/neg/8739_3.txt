To be honest I never read one of the comics and can't even remember parts 2 and 3. I can compare with the first part (Werner - Beinhart), and this one is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as in relation to the Most other movies I saw last weeks. The first minutes stitch to be just an excess clone of the first movie intro and then it gets even worse. There are a couple of good (funny) scenes, but in all, it's just another dull second rate of German film industry that can't succeed (almost as usual). A good thing: The movie is pretty short (75 min.) The bad thing: It only contains history and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Don't watch it
