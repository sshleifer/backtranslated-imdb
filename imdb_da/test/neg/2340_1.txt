If you are a pretentious person, it would sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality and say you really like this movie. Otherwise, don't bother and look better at something good. <Br /> <br /> This is the stereotypical movie for snobs. The baseline would be very silly if you could see it from the beginning to the end. It is just presented in a tremendous way as an attempt to make it difficult to understand and make the movie look intellectual. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not fun to see. You would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it. And if you do, you will most likely be disappointed because it's not a big deal.
