This movie does not even have the saving grace to be so bad that it is good. It is really terrible. It is closer to a parody in the tongue than a disaster movie, but unfortunately they were serious. Made for tv but not worth it though. It contains every clich√© and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. Oh does he want to save the city from the flood? Will his wife admit she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can't explain how bad this is. Terrible predictable plot that makes you wave it is so cheesy. Bad Effects (although I have become fair, I have seen worse supercharged bubbling water). Bad script. Creepy action. Hideous. So bad that you probably should be full and see it.
