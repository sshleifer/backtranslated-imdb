Most of the critics on this flick have been pretty damned. It is an hour and a half waste of time, after a bunch of very beautiful high school students gnaw and cry about life. There are about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or exciting moments. Our actress is treated as pieces and seems to be quite happy with their position. The main characters, these sons of ipsmith, go to poster boys for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate to them, hell, you can hardly understand them. The story goes all over itself, and when it finally reaches the final battle, it is no more than a volleyball game that does not last long enough to deal with this garbage rape from O.C.
