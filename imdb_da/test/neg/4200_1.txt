I couldn't even ... I mean ... see .... okay ... <br /> <br /> Wow. Not even a bunch of my full friends trying to make fun with the movie could enjoy themselves at least. <br /> <br /> I can only think ... how. How do independent filmmakers go anywhere this year without being noticed (or even their lives) and co-authors like the guy who made this get a DVD on a shelf? It looks like a guy with a home theater camera went out with some guys he met on the subway and made the worst he could think of. "Hey guys, give me some ideas. Start with a grain field and work backwards." "Now you have actors right out of high school, and some broken corn stalks with garments that are tied together. And breasts." Thanks, guy, I'm sure you and Windows Movie Maker will be next to your next unexpected project.
