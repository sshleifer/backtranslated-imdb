In essence, an unforgettable B-movie, mysteriously led by one of the Golden Age's great talents, Fritz Lang. Even with the star's names on Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, be prepared for a ridiculous story, bad acting, clever false set and miscasting. For the sake of transparency, I must admit that I am a glowing non-admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate to have found a niche at MGM's artificial dream factory and somehow worked in secondary roles and supported Greer Garson and others. He is wildly mistaken, appearing in a chipper, '30s Ray Milland Madcap comedy tone, in a role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is exaggerated, but her painted hair, perfect makeup and classic outfit illuminate a street-wise Cockney slum girl. George Sanders is unable to seem bad, but disappears after the prehistoric opening finds Pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler. Surprisingly, Fritz Lang's tone is uneven. I found the movie twisted uncomfortably between occasional moments of thrill thriller surrounded by light hearted comic interactions. Hitchcock revolved around the relationship, using comic bookloading to the occasional pace. There is a reason why this movie is unknown. It did not earn or evoke any career or reputation, and is forgotten because it is a surprisingly poor movie from such a pedigree group.
