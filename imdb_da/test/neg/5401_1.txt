I saw this on Sci Fi, and in retrospect I'm not sure how I actually got it to see it all the way through. This is a complete garbage can. It's not a B movie, it's at best a D movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this ugly reaper looks on a horse (and sometimes not on one) to kill everything in its path somewhere in the middle of the west of America. A lot of people are missing (infact murdered) and a lot of mismatched spec up soldier types are looking for them. The best part of this movie, I tell you now, are some really cute girls. Now let me pamper this by telling you that anything but the least sweet one gets the heads either chopped, cut to pieces or hit so hard with a mêlée weapon that the head explodes. There are no spoiler ... Gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque. Nor does it serve anything right. <br /> <br /> Here's what's good: The seats look OK, the actors sometimes work fine. The outfits and props, some of them, are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you can think of sucks. Much of the badness is in editing. Sometimes it just changes from a quick action scene to a really quiet and sleeping scene. Sometimes the characters do not understand things, and they always split up, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. It seems that they are being split without realizing it, but they also all know they are split all the time and are okay with themselves, they are in a really dangerous situation and there are bodies everywhere and people door right and left. Nothing in this movie is at least plausible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and I don't really understand how this immortal, indestructible bad guy could eventually be stopped, and honestly I don't care. Too much stupid, hilarious bad nonsense happens during this movie, and I'm not really interested in listing it all here. And they are all so serious throughout the trial when it is almost ridiculously bad ... just awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete waste of time. There is no excuse to see this unless the only channel you happen to receive is SciFi and you are tied to a chair in front of the TV. But if you're not tied up, you're better off making a crossword, throwing a frisbee, or just thinking. There are many much better B movies you can see. My senior year in high school my friend and I, in visual communication and deign class, made a long movie trailer-type agreement for our own movie (There was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we did a better job of film and edit the piece with premiere. It was better work than this movie. It really says something about this and I'm confused and worried why Sci Fi would show something like this when there are so many good low-frequency movies they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie I "I have always endured that was worse than this is Raptor Island (another brilliant Scifi work), although it had a smoother and more compliant stream than this movie - but it comes very close and is certainly 2nd on my list of worst movies I've ever seen.
