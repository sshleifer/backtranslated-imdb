This movie can't be serious because it has a nerdy-looking kid called Curtis killing people. The other two psycho-children are cute, but Curtis child is just as ugly because he wears these big, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably walked on the wrong set, and he should really go to NÃ¸rdens Revenge. Another thing I hate a lot about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. I held my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was nothing on it. <br /> <br /> Then they put that annoying child in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight in there. It made no sense, nor the music. The music does not fit any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch another movie on your birthday.
