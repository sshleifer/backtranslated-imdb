This movie is about a party composed of high school "scary girl." As per the illogical of these kinds of films, she is allowed to hold the party in a house that used to be a crematorium, a dubious place that is long closed and unlocked. Apparently the story of this piece of property is one of the city secrets best left without telling among the real people, even though the legend is whispering among the young. Why was this crematorium really shut down? What really happened earlier? <br /> <br /> I like these kill kill kill movies of supernatural character as long as there is something in them that is not copied from hundreds of other movies. The highlights of this movie are a small theft "7-11" robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view, the changing clothing scene of the "good girl" witnessing his younger brother, the final death of the ugly neighbor who hate the holiday, the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water is a barrier to the supernatural; the best part of this movie is when the Occupied Party's sponsor dances to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; The scene rocks.
