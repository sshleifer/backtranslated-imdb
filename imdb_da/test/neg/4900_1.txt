To start, I am not a person to judge movies that I have not seen, nor am I a person who judges film 1 when they do not deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The plot was extremely formal, and while it wasn't amazing, the plot deserved a 5. The part that really bothered me was something that refers to swimming in the movie. I have made a short list of things that are wrong with the swimming aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No sign development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Incorrect swimming scenes that include: a. A team of six swimmers going to something called both "Nationals" and "regional" without mentioning how they qualify. b. The same team goes to what the hell this met without swimming a real meeting at any point in the movie. c. The rival program goes from being a high school to a club team back to a high school and then a club team again. d. In the scene where Ellis interviews for a job, the banners show higher school status and rankings with nationals, but the team consists of anywhere from 5 to 12 swimmers depending on which of the three meetings is taking place. e. A team of 5 guys and a girl wins citizens / regions regardless. f. That girl wins a man's 100 butterfly event. g. In this race, the girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top 3 of the nation. h. The advertiser changes a race from 200 breasts to 100 breasts back to 200 again in the tension of about 45 seconds. I. In the last relay, 4X100, which swims in a 50-meter course pool, is a swimmer seen with two flip turns. j. In this same relay jumps the anchor teams swim out and pull out of the blocks, giving an inspiring pep talk that lasts about two and a half minutes, or approx. 3 times as long as the leg will take on a national caliber meeting. k. The film begins in July or August, provided that Ellis applied before the school year started and the pool should be closed in 3 months, so assuming that these things were both in order, the swimmers failed to swim to win citizens / regional No matter, in less than two, when the pool was to be cleaned and the kids didn't start practicing for a while. l. I'm sure there are a few hundred more, I'm just trying to block them out of my memory. 4. Throughout the movie there is not a single mention of a swim time. 5. If you want a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire extras that know how to swim well. 6. The scene where the child is kicked underwater is physically impossible. Having said that, all swimming scenes were too slow, swimmers had horrible techniques and the idea of ​​being able to qualify for national meetings within three months of learning to swim is just insulting to swimmers everywhere. <br /> <br /> OK, if you still don't believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and it comes from the guy who owns Gigli Soul Plane, Manos: The Event of Destiny, Skullduggery and any other total piece of crap that is put on film. Please don't go!
