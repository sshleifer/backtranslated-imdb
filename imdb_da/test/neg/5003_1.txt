This movie was horrible. It was so terrible. <br /> <br /> Most annoying was the way the experiment was conducted. The Defense Attorney is allowed to stumble over and over when questioning a witness without prosecution that raises objections. He attacks the children brought to testify of cruel greed and repeatedly calls on them to lie. These are just not things they expose children who have been sexually abused. The experiment is stupid and it destroys the whole movie ... (Law and order have spoiled me for the accuracy of legal certainty).
