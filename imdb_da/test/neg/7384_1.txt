This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, it was not fun at all, not sure why people say this movie is fun because it sucked so much !! Felix Bean protagonist sucked. Susanna sucked. This film was made in 1996 and it was really set in the 80s. What I never do, my friend chooses movies ever again. Hmm, the film cover said it was from the producers of super troops who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only minute that was fun was Freaky Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily ended up. It was fun. All in all it sucked, a waste of time and sleep. Wow, never thought a movie like this could be made, so stupid to look at it at the end.
