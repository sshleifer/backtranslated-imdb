Anatomy is not very unique in horror genres, it is not even scary. It reminds me of his American cousins, scarecrowers. It's just a copy of any other scary slasher, and as a German movie, it's just for American with nothing to add to it. In fact, the anatomy is predictable and boring, its plot is not intact and consistent. It has stupid scenes for what doesn't even fit into a horror movie genre. Entertaining sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why should they have it all in just a movie? They should have made a cheap German adult film instead. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring.
