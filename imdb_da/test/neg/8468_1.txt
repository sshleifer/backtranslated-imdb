It is utter nonsense. I have studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the "parallels" use most of the classic run-down apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete, detailed generalizations of what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It is designed for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency, costing heavily on vagina-born gibberish, terribly thought-out arguments, irrational conclusions, false ideas, and inhuman logic. Who made this hit peace? Easy. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done; Que Bono? That is who benefits in the long run? <br /> <br /> You don't. You sacrifice money and rights. Muslims don't, they get our bombs. Please try again. Answer this and you have locked up a large door.
