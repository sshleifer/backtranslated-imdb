Despite a small handful of nicely performed scenes, this post (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the amazing MERMAID LEGEND and the usual Japanese splatter movie, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows some excitement for the terrible premise. A miscreant is obsessed with an extrovert conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porn photography. Predictable stalking, harassment, assault and rape. <br /> <br /> The staple of Roman porn is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting topics, certainly, but not when little effort is made to make them fresh. A masturbation scene where a woman strengthens pencils in the opening (via condom) is too little kink to late. The series' rain motif continues and the film's last scene brings relief.
