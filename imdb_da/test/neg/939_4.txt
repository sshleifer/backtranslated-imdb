A fast and fun matinee body that attracts the underdog's aldolescent in all of us. It acts as a vehicle for Justin Long, which subsequently broke out on our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs Mac ads, Dodgeball and The Break Up. He is fun, serious and young - a great career ahead. <br /> <br /> A city's worth of college wannabes finds a fake website Bartelby (Long) has set up to deceive his judgmental parents and get down to college as it was a short notice Facebook party. Lewis Black summarizes the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in Dean - Long's criminal friends provide support to the subterranean and subsequent appeal to major traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his non-fluttering slapstick contribution). Well executed, emotionally and instantly forgettable. 4.10
