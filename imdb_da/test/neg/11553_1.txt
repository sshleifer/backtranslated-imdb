It is unthinkable for me how anyone could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie. I'd say it's the worst movie I've seen this year, and I see many of them. Maybe I forgot junior high? It is also very hard to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels who made such an excellent performance by George Washington in The Crossing. Looks like he's been doing Dumber, he's been thinking. Can you believe that he himself wrote and directed this unwanted?
