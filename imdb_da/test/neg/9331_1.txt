Tyrone Power was tossed as Salomon. However, he died halfway through the film unexpectedly. The studio chose to throw Yul Brynner in the lead and resume scenes that Power had done. Gradually, considering how horrible this movie was, Power was fortunate - as it would have been a terrible way to end his lovely movie career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epochs I have seen, this is by far the worst - and it says a lot because Hollywood has made many boring biblical stories - so many wonder if the creation of these movies was an atheist conspiracy !! In fact, the movie was so boring that it was profitably included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The Five-Year-Worst Movies of All Time". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst is how incredibly thoughtful it was! Sure to caste people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents to play Egyptians and Israelis was pretty bad - but at least it made the film strangely humorous. Having Mercy Gina Lollobrigida plays the role of a woman who has been thought to have come from somewhere around Ethiopia, was also just awful, but at least she was beautiful, even though she couldn't act. Having an overweight and post-middle aged George Sanders playing such a young role was also pretty poor, but at least he had a beautiful voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and revoltingly boring was pretty poor, but at least one had to look in the credits mentioning a person like the "orgy choreographer"! No, the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it looked like nine, it was so poorly paced and scary! Considering that the only mention of this queen of Saba and Solomon is only in a few fragile verses in the Old Testament, it is amazing that the film just went on and on again. The greatest story ever was a little longer, but that movie was based on four Gospels - not a dozen or so verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the film is miserable in virtually every way (except Gina's cleavage). Even for devout Christians and Jews, this is a must-avoid movie because it plays so fast and loses the truth as well as injects a great amount of sex into a biblical movie !!! Terrible in almost every way, it is really a blessing for Tyrone Power that he is not remembered to be at the forefront of this inflated turkey.
