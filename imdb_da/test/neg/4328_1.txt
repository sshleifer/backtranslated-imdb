Extremely boring .. I don't care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby sucks ... and don't go and see it because I mentioned it, save it for Warhol's "Empire", it's much more entertaining! ! I've seen other Duras movies that were far better so I'm surprised why this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I have had to consider radical works by Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and in these artists I can still see artistic intent, even quality and an entertaining aspect of performing their art. As for the "India Song" - it's not even soft porn - Anias Nin was almost here - G-rated slide show of sex and a voice-over that didn't relate to the slide show / movie ...... pure crap and not even campy ... unfortunately just a drilling and waste of 2 hours. To add insult to injury, it was printed, I looked, faded and scratched to hell !!! (Harvard Film Archive) If I want to see "entertaining boring", I see Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - keep your head high for late modernism and be boring !! Watch a 70's porn movie with all the good parts cut out and beat the sound, you get the "India Song" but with better filmography and none of the annoying music or screams from the vice consul !!!
