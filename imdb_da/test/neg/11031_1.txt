This movie is an example of a small budget, ineffective star goods, weak history and poor entertainment. This kind of movie is made for commercial breaks and not for entertainment by die-hard fans of Bollywood movies. I went to this movie because I thought the former gangster was tolerable, so it is too. The only thing I appreciate how a new actress sits in the movie in a very bold way, looks very much like bollywood actress nandita das. she is good, sexy and works well. She certainly goes up in her career. our mithunda was always good at his work. first he has something good with the film. I didn't like imran because his role has to advise him to improve now that he has made many films as a new actor and he has been seen as an established actor. This movie has nothing but the bold scene of a new actress. Never try this movie
