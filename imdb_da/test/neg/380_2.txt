This one kind is like a previous movie from the 1987 "Masters of the Universe" based on the "He-man" comic. Basically, you have a good old world, and for some reason they should have almost all of the film's actions on modern soil. Well, I suppose it is not so modern now, and that it is an old world now of oddity and a day of good times past. Now I think I can figure out why they actually put almost the whole movie in modern times in this and that movie. Saving money on costumes and sets. It is much easier to recreate what is happening in the present than a strange world like Eternia in He-man or an ancient world of cultures and strange pyramids, victims and strange creatures that hug you to death. This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining, your first clue that it's not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this one has to do for it is the animals that are not as prevalent in this as they were last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad to see him in this state, the guy was a relatively good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really didn't need one and even if it did, come It's five years late.
