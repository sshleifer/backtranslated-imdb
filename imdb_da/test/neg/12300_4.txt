'The 4th Floor' is a related mediocre movie with Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a wing of a neighbor. Jane (Lewis) recently inherited a fantastic 5th floor apartment from her grandmother and, in agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low rental rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy weatherman) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own room. So she enters and strange things begin to happen, and because this is a B-grade horror flick, there is a stupid, not-to-be-found-in fact the reason why. Since Jane doesn't try to tell anyone else too much - her boyfriend, police, colleagues - what is going on, everyone thinks she's losing it. So of course she has to face the problem - the capricious lives just below her alone. Neither scary nor interesting, the movie's single saving grace is Lewis. She is a very fine actress, but badly used here, which is not to say that she is not the best thing about this girl - because she is. She has feral charisma and keeps the screen better than a dozen silicone bimbos that routinely expand this type of film. However, this type of movie is not worth it for her - which is ironic, as she is probably the only reason why anyone would see it.
