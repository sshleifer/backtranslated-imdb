I'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am I disturbed by the cynical, self-righteous attitude of the creators of this crap. <br /> <br /> What I am disturbing is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if all the episodes were staged. Therefore, this is not a reality show, but something far worse than Oprah: garbage tv with zero come zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and struggle and less plot. The principle would have proved fantastic - if it had only been executed without cheating the viewer. If only this idea was free of all the legal complications / trappings that would surely follow due to what would happen to real people and what was eventually sent. Therefore, the only way to create this "" reality show on "" was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise (and what pitiful and inconsistent improvisation is most of the time!). High school graduates Most of the reviews I read here do not even mention that some of these are false, let alone that it can be: Want thinking or just boundless naivety? <br /> <br /> The actors, who are employed in this pathetic show are the kind of unemployed actors who are underground waiting for the tables and eagerly await a call from a talk show (or this crap) which is when they finally get a chance to make hundreds of bucks "I even recognized an actress (in the role of" cheat ") as I saw years earlier in" The Jerry Springer Show. "And I only saw 6-7 episodes of" Cheaters ". How many more of these losers actors are there who appeared in Springer and "Cheaters "which I don't even know? <br /> <br /> However, to compare "Cheaters" with Springer, it is not reasonable for the latter. The jumping show is not all fake; A large part of the episodes are unstaged - therefore often very entertaining. There is no value to be found in "Cheaters" unless you are a struggling actor and want to get tips on how NOT to shop in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers use different (very cheap, transparent) tricks to create the illusion of reality, to give their recordings the unpleasant documentary feeling. But that's all in the way. Finally, the more intelligent train-wreck-seeker is left with absolute squat. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.
