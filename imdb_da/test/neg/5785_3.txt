Note to myself. Never ever see a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, horrible seal. This movie makes the Navy SEALS look like a ruthless group of rangers when in reality they are the most elite kind of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy Navy SEAL Reputation. Thanks for making such an incredibly select group of people look awful in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is a great story that could turn into a great action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are opportunities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
