Mildly entertaining and self-conscious cheezy - but what could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often doubles. McClure is just for Cheezy to be believed, but who can blame him in the destruction of this movie whose plot of ancient dinosaur ruling people has 19th Century throwback "period charm" but not enough and unfortunately the script carries the racist connotations of literary genre in film. Nice action from the actors, but a poorly thought out production.
