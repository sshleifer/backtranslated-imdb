The plot of this movie is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is incest in saving her, the oath turns into a swan, the turtle / frog / puffin is first the "bad" magician as best they can and finally .... At least there is not much new here. With the exception of the lack of familiar talents. Sorry, no Palance or Cleese and thus Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
