I am so disappointed. After waiting three years for the repetition / DVD in the original masterpiece series "Darkplace" I couldn't wait for this series. The first episode has just ended and I am shocked. Everything that was good about Darkplace has been deleted here, pretty much. Worst introduction: canned laughter. This takes the original point away from it and makes it almost impossible. (A joke about Garth's eyes that fertilize the audience was good ... the rest I almost can't remember ...) It feels like a poor quality "Know me, know you." I hope this will improve as the series continues, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> "You are the most compassionate man I have ever known. And I know God ..."
