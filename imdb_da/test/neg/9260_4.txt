Seven pioneer children independently strive for many miles of Indian territory and severe weather to reach Oregon. <br /> <br /> According to history, young'uns who traveled themselves over long distances - as with 'Children's Crusade' - were manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery, but these children are right hard and they try their best to reach their goal of making a farm in the west. Movies are a bit too syrupy at times, but OK for fans of 'The Waltons' and 'Little House on the Prairie'. <br /> <br /> Dean Smith gives a cool performance like 'Kit Carson'.
