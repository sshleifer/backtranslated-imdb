I love beach boys and their music. So, I'm a movie maker, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys Movie sounds great. Well, wrong! I just actually switched off the HDNET, the channel the movie was playing because it was so bad. Someone above about editing ... yes, they should at least have looked at screens while they were filming. I do not know if anyone else has been chased to fall out of one of the guy's faces after he kissed his wife and then smoothed it with his hands again. Ever heard of taking a scene again! The deals were terrible. The direction was horrible. The make-up was AWFUL !!! Possibly the worst makeup I have ever seen. Brian Wilson's "cool" kid looks like pl-ado. <br /> <br /> This is honestly the first time I've ever commented on IMDb, and I really don't make a difference ... but come on, what the hell were the manufacturers thinking?!?! !?
