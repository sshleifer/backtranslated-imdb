I can't believe I even wasted a NetFlix rental on this complete piece of CRAP. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen bucks? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous lump of bile and it's even available on DVD!? !! A very sad thing to think of classics like The Stepfather has not been released on DVD, but this lump of steaming cloth makes it the format. Here, I hope my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE makes the overall (already) pathetic rating of 2.5 go down.
