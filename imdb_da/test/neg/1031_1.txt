Here's an outline of a typical Rachael Ray Show: <br /> 1. The horrible theme song begins to play, and Rachael puts down his Snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator. 2. She starts running around and screams and / or offends the audience, then shouts at them, sits down. 3. An inappropriate monologue. <br /> <br /> (The next one is in any order). 4. A segment tooting Rachael's own horn (ie "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's Recipes", Rachael Ray Saved my Life "Rachael's Fashion Tips.") 5. A completely useless DIY tip (ie how to engrave words in stews, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it.) 6. triggering a terrible recipe for the unsuspecting audience (reaction shot of the first bite is never shown). 7. A celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously written questions from the audience. 8. A person who gets help from one of Rachael's cronies (ie I say yes to all woman, I own nothing but overalls lady, and I can't find time to put makeup housewife). What would they do without you Rachael. * Gisp * <br /> <br /> Reasons why this show should be avoided as the plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray claims the whole show is uscripted. Many people who have participated in the tapings of the show have claimed that the whole show is scripted. Many of the same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Her show jumps too much: Wherever Oprah, who is the highest rated talk show of all time has a particular theme for her show, Rachael jumps around like an ADHD soda on crack. Her shows average maybe 10, short, worthless segments a show. Otherwise you will get fashion tips from Kojo, and the next Rachael will make brown stuffed "Spanish" peppers with manchego cheese, and the next will be a huge anaconda up the stage, and the next, well you get the picture. <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a bad host with bad ideas: Apart from his lattice personality, Rachael's hosting ability is at best horrible. Her questions to her celebrity guests are poor, and often not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are unpleasant and offer little educational or humorous value. Finally, do not waste your time with this schlock. It will soon be canceled.
