Salesman Lenny Brown (Woods) quickly loses his ability to sell the gloomy ice cream to Eskimos. Given a chance to shine in California by a philanthropic entrepreneur, Brown and his wife Linda (Young) live in high life outside of tax offices; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes tax laws. <br/> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in red, and a "boost" is needed, they begin without portraits to begin bending huge amounts of Colombian marching powders up their hooters until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on the back.
