Adventure in Dinosaur City, though a creative idea, was a nauseating horrible attempt at film making. Being sucked into a television and into a new world is interesting. Three teenagers obsessively thrilled with half-animated dinosaurs are not. Don't waste time or brain power to see this safe loser. I wouldn't even let my kids see it.
