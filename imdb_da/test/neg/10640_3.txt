*** SPOILERS! *** I sometimes wonder what makes followers believe they should explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries of iconic Horror movies. The original "Hellraiser" from 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The 1988 sequel "Hellbound" was also a fantastic Horror movie, although I personally did not like the viewer's background information on the cenobites, some of the all-time craziest horror villains in the original. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992) was already pretty clumsy if decision makers of course thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the previously incomparably scary lead-cenobite Pinhead (a typical 90's stupidity) and therefore destroyed most of it. his fragility. This fourth part, "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is a little more atmospheric than the third, but it lowers this quality by perceiving even more stupid and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell. <br /> <br /> Seriously - should we know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made? I do not believe, and that is not the only mystery of the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this movie. The setting of "Bloodline" goes back and forth for three different periods. The film begins in a 22nd century space station when researcher Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) is trying to close the gates to hell forever. When government soldiers disrupt their mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century, the merchant's ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle of an aristocrat occupying the occult. An evicted demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, cursing the bloodline of the tomaker, and his ancestors attacked by cenobites through the ages ... The film that takes place in the 18th century, present and The 22nd century is really a mess. I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a grim atmosphere and is by far the best part of the movie, but it is also the smallest part. The parts set in the present and in the future are rather weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. The movie's undoubtedly strong points are the amazing make-up and gore effects, the incredible Valentina Varagas as its demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite having lost some of his creepy, is still a threatening villain. It's an almost offensive idea for "Hellraiser" fans that Pinhead is supposed to be defeated by a ridiculous light show. In general, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is certainly an unworthy successor to a series that began so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed by it as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, this is only recommended for hardcore Pinhead fanatics, and most of them are likely to be angry at another diminution of their favorite demon's fragility. Everybody else is well-informed to hold onto the brilliant first and excellent second part of the "Hellraiser" franchise and skip all the others. The makeup effects in "Bloodline" are scary as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. My rating: 3.5 / 10
