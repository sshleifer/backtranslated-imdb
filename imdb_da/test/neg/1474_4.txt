Sorry, people, but all of you who say this is a great documentary ... and the price it won in Sundance ... Now you've all been duped. I've heard for a couple of years how I had to see this documentary and I finally saw it. Perhaps in 1999, when it came out, and reality TV had no such dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have been entertaining. But Mike and Mark then play themselves, Mike and Mark. At times they are funny, and some of the lines look like cuffs, but mostly they don't ring properly. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes the people are real, they are not actors, but it is on, it is exaggeration of itself, and it is so obvious that it is hard to believe so many believe it is the right deal. I was not fooled, so it was actually a bit boring. Mildly entertaining, but not much if you miss it.
