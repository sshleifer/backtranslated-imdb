Dear SciFi Channel: How have you been? How was your summer? I have been ok, but I feel that our relationship is not the same anymore and we are growing apart. I don't understand why you don't love me anymore. I just finished watching your SciFi Channel Original "Skeleton Man" and once again you have shown an obvious lack of respect for my feelings by killing every hot girl in this movie !!! I mean, I understand you are just here for instant gratification. All you care about is producing a movie where people get cut and threshed by a homicidal Indian spirit / creature / legend / whatever. So you really don't have time to put some thought and effort into something else - like finding a Skeleton Man costume that doesn't make him the gay lover of Skeletor from "He-Man". Seriously, his robe looks like a satin carpet, and his skull is smooth as a baby behind. He almost resembles a killer Halloween costume-for-a-6 year old as he marches through the desert on a homicidal rampage. So we throw you a leg because we are not looking for Oscar-winning performances, exciting plot or realistic character reactions to the current situations. Because we realize that although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls are to be trained Special Ops agents, they are all mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops, which cannot shoot or look right when Skeleton Man appears. And we also fully expect that nothing - bullets, explosions, electricity, nothing - can kill Skeleton Man until there is a minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up nicely. We expect to see blood and gut. But you have the ability to take the least attractive actress throughout the cast and make her the only female survivor. And honestly, I think you just do it to counteract me. Because this movie, as silly as it, has the potential to be a "so bad-it's-good" classic and just kill all those hotties destroys everything - and forces me to lower its rating. All I ask is that once, only once, you pay attention to my feelings and let the sexy girls survive the movie. Please.
