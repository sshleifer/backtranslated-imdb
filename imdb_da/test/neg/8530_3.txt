Special sneak previews are always a good time. Whatever movie you see, the theater will always be packed by people who have been waiting for the movie, like free stuff, thought it would be something to do, or just lost. No matter how good or bad the movie is, the audience alone will make it fun. Now that the movie is a PG-13 pseudo-horror movie (can you really stumble into horror when MPAA is on the back censoring everything?) You know there will be chatting, laughing and breathing. With messengers disappointed audiences not giving many outbreaks and warnings to the characters on the screen. As for the actual movie, I feel sorry for those involved because it could really have been much better if it had been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare / fade to black / show after progress these movies have . In the end, we show a boring, plodding story without surprises and moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> History is a common one. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try to rebuild their relationship with each other. Once they have come in, the house spirits come to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for parents to disbelieve everything they tell them. Of course, the baby does not cry wolf and those who come around find out when it is too late. I want to credit Pang Brothers (directors of the recognized The Eye, which I would like to see more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood interference supposedly reshoots on the Messengers was made by someone else, but the brothers kept credit It is a pity what our studio system does for foreigners, especially when it was creative independence, which made the movies that bring them in and not bottom line interference, to really have an appropriate style and to keep the tired plot line fresh. Unfortunately, I must also give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness. Like why I didn't like what is underneath, I couldn't keep the excitement that goes so far that it makes it ridiculous. When our heroine and her brother stand at once with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts approx. Eight minutes of just static, strange composite close-ups and depth of field focus changes to the culmination of absolutely nothing. To be only 84 minutes, I almost think it would have worked better even shorter. In addition to a very effective opening sequence with the amazing Jodelle Ferland (oddly playing a boy) and a great atmospheric credit sequence, the only thing that saves the movie from complete waste is the actor. Apart from Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what happened to her, and after a few scenes I got to understand why I never asked the question in the years she was absent and Dustin Milligan which lacked credibility, trades are very strong. Dyan McDermott does a good job as his father tries to keep his family together through all the difficult times. He has many small moments of comedy to counteract his serious, dramatic role. William B. Davis (everyone's favorite Cancerman) is used effectively as an almost fake character, unfortunately not exploited any more. Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotions very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and the Panic Room on her CV. Regarding Corbett, if he hadn't drawn his role, the whole movie would have swallowed up completely. I wish he would get more work, as I have had him since the implied series "The Visitor"? I still have to check out his first role in "Northern Exposure", a show I have not yet been able to catch. It is a pity that he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated My Big Fat Greek Wedding. <br /> <br /> If anything, Messengers gave me a good introduction to Pang Brothers' work and revived my desire to check out their Chinese horror catalog. The atmosphere and the performances were there; It was just the simple and vacant story that needed too much padding to make a feature film. If they did more into other characters, rather than just Stewart, it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten-minute scenes of nothing. If our protagonist is the only one being attacked, there is no excitement as to how far the creatures will go to harm her. Father's moments had no gravity for them, and until the end, there was really only a filler. However, I am excited about the free comic book released after the special screening, which hopefully the medium will allow for a faster story that skips before it tries to surprise.
