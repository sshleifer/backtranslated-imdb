You know the movies that are so unthinkable that you have to laugh? Half-cast was not one of them. Which sounds good, doesn't it? But no it is not. It's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that is fun to watch because it's lame or not well-acted, or has bad special effects or anything else. No, half-throw is simply boring. They do not even attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so. It's just kids running around in the African bush country and getting high by the elephant mill for the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even fun. However, the last 20 minutes are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was great fun to see the CGI leopard tearing in all the white guys I couldn't tell from each other. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, don't hire this one because you go to bed before they come to the fun stuff. If you randomly rent this movie, I recommend fast forwarding to the end and skip any scene in daylight. You won't miss anything. You won't have any idea what character is, what or what happens even if you see the whole back story.
