I can't see how anyone can say this was a really good entertaining movie. With a few well-known actors I found it hard to believe that it was only made in 2005. It's bad! The action is synonymous with amateur drama, bad amateur drama. Unless you want to laugh aloud in a fantastic 100 minute pure corn, don't bother downloading it or renting it, the worst I've seen this year. It is from the past days when cowboys shoot 8 bullets from the six shooters. The more known the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. I was extremely disappointed by Lee Majors, has he actually bent on this kind of garbage? It was bad enough when he played $ 6 million man.
