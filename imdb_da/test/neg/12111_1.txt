This thing, directed by the French sensation Patrick Sebastien, is worst than all the turkeys you might have seen. Forget about Independence Day, Kazaam, Patriot, etc. You get the picture, these are the mines. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in France (if you need a similar, let's say he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), it's his first movie, let's hope it's the last. I hope that Troma or anyone will distribute this movie in the states so that you out there can excel the French stench at worst. Let's cut it short, this is the Masterpiece of S ** t.
