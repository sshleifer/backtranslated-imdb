This is really one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It's not fun at all. It simply portrays a lower class Nordic British attitude. I find it a very sad movie on parts, while others are cuts where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me was the close-ups of meaningless objects that really slowed the pace of the movie. I only made it through the movie because I quickly forwarded certain sequences to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie completely loses public attention. The biggest problem is that it provides several reasons for an action which in turn tends to weaken the action. But if there is a reason for an action, it makes it more passionate. All in all, this movie is everywhere. I did not learn enough about the signs to worry about them because of the changing plot lines and stories where as I might have enjoyed exploring the life of a character. For example, in the beginning, when guy meets god in the bar, God seems like a cool guy. The movie could have deepened at that moment, and I think it would have been much more fun. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough if it is. See it if you want, but I warn you that this movie is bad. I respect the decision makers to try to remove it with such a low budget, but they could have done a much better job. I think it's all lies in the camera's movement and editing, the play was decent. But then it's just my opinion.
