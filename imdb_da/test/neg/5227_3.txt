I'm a fan of Ed Harris's work and I had really high expectations for this movie. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a great advantage for an instructor, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think Needful Things is the worst movie of Harris's filmography, and it was a big mistake to involve it. Anyway, I've seen much worse movies in my life, but Needful Things was a disappointment because of a waste of acting talent. The story as a whole seems too incredible and false. I don't know if it's because of the book, because I haven't read it. But if the script was so bad, I can't see the reason for filming it. Perhaps it was the commercial success of the king's books or the need for low-quality films for the VHS era in the 90s. Whatever the cause, this movie was a very bad choice for everyone involved.
