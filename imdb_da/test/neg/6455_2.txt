Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you want to thank me for it. This is the worst movie I've seen for some time. I came to this board, which expects to see the same answer I had, but inexplicably there are more people who love this movie and Spacey's performance in particular. <br /> <br /> Some will bitch me to say it, but I find Kevin Spacey to be quite limited despite the world admiration for him. I felt that I saw a worrying version of Kevin's role "American Beauty". His character in this movie is ridiculously exaggerated, right down to his ridiculous insults he throws at his assistant. There are worldwide tired and boring scenes that reach the Spacey river in Whaley to bring him straight instead of sweat and low. Somehow, I suspected that this scene should be fun, but at this point I was ready to hit the stop button (it's about 20 minutes in the movie). What about faux-homage for "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley proclaims, "I think I once saw a movie," as if he would cut off Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, he'll give him paper cuts! It must be one of Hollywood's highest scenes, and the fact that the actors and the director tried to do it with a straight face makes it even more terrible. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I did not see the end of this movie (my DVD mercifully locked up about half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say it could save me line that I missed a good twist, and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all the bad plays and relentless over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie as bad as I did.
