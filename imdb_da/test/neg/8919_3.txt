Today, you start dying as honored criminal Harlan banks (producer Steven Seagal) recruited by the scary businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a $ 20 million cash back vehicle from the 'A' Las Vegas casino back Point "B" he sounds quite right? Well, what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money is stolen and that he has just become a chauffeur in an armed robbery. Harlan managed to hide him in prison for a long time, but Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught and with a nice $ 20 million game and unclear that Harlan should see the back as the bad guys want it as government agents. stand up with Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison and they both manage to escape at what time Harlan is looking for some revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photographed and directed by Don E FauntLeRoy you have to say that the shot in Eastern Europe direct-to-video action movies, which Steven Seagal specializes in these days, do not get better and today You Die is a good example. This is a horrible movie, simple as it really is. The writer of producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore & Les Weldon, gives Seagal a new kind of character to get its no existing functional skills around, namely a criminal rather than a government agent / policeman / soldier / a man clich√© that he usually plays. In fact, if you were charitable, you could say Today, You Die is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998), where he also played a really unpleasant job for such a good effect. While Payback was an amazingly uncompromising hard edged movie noir type action thriller today, you won't die and become insignificant by comparison. Unfortunately, Seagal is terrible, he has no on-screen presence or threat either & the audience is never quite sure if he is meant to be a bad guy whom we hate or not. For example, his character is set up as a modern Robin Hood, which he steals from the rich drug dealers and scumbags to give the poor (as well as keeping a clean profit to himself) who is just ridiculous in himself, but then has The Seagal revolves around and m The story is full of holes, for example Agent Knowles being contacted by Harlan & then being reprimanded by his bowed superior to meet him and it turns out he found out to tap her phone. If so, did her boss not use the information he had to capture Harlan? The story is the usual boring predictable gentle fight over lots of money with the surprise surprise the investigative government agent is actually a bad guy! Wow, I didn't see that I should say ... Director FauntLeRoy lowers everything down to a snail's pace and today you feel Die as if it is going on forever, action scenes and set-pieces are also greatly lacking in entertainment value. The rare battle scenes are not great, most are either shot in shade, very quickly cut and edited or with the camera played behind Seagal's character to try to explain that most of the stunt work done here is double. Through Seagal, fat looks out of shape and uses long baggy overcoats to try and hide it, it doesn't. There is a pretty cool car through the Las Vegas streets in this at first, and I thought today you can die altogether, but it seems that the entire sequence was stolen from another action movie called Top of the World (1997), which is about a casino in Las Vegas, and using footage from this movie. Today, You Die also edits scenes from Charlie Sheen's action film No Code of Conduct (1998), Jean-Claude Van Damme's action movie The Order (2001) and Wesley Snipe's prison-based action film Undisputed (2002) as much of today as you are original recordings are no guesses. Technically, the movie is okay as it is edited together from four separate movies, as well as it's own footage it is just about competent and consistent enough. Of course, all the footage in the American places is lifted by the films already mentioned with all the original footage on the cheap in Bulgaria. The rap style music that litter today you kill is terribly by the way. The action is bad & Seagal just mumbles its way through his lines as usual. <br /> <br /> Today you are a really bad movie made by other bad action movies, Seagal looks old and cool, the action scenes are average at best and most of the story is pretty random and it doesn't come together at all at the end. One to avoid unless your a die hard Seagal fan, if such an animal even exists ...
