The film shows relationships between the dying mother and the son who are very attached to her and absolutely love her. What does it show? It shows their lives in very bad conditions. It shows how much they "go" (really he brings her). But what do we look forward to? After their promenade he goes alone in the same places where they walked together. It is not possible. Someone who loves and cares for another dying would do everything to make this life a better one. He did not want a free minute to consider being alone with himself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for it, he would run away from the places where he should normally be. Another thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see that he learned many Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's films they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. Someone compared this movie to "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing common except for these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great movie, and this is just bad imitation.
