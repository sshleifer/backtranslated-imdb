This movie baffled me. I couldn't get it. Thought I could lack something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my latest review of RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> To explain the error in this movie, it would be a wonderful waste of time ... so I want to. .. <br /> <br /> They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? None? I do not understand it ??? When I pick up the box I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! That's how it was presented. Haven't seen it yet. Hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> They didn't! They tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series. They didn't. <br /> <br /> They tried to make an Aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber (and maybe ride the fur shells) of the very well done "UNDEAD". They didn't. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe they would just make a confusing, heterogeneous mess of movie salad that could eventually be edited to something that could be seen. They didn't! This is the new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies ever. There is really only the two so far, "DAG OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM" is the first (not to be confused with "DAY OF DEAD", which is one of my favorite zombie films all the time). If you want to make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie movie producer, I'm just a knower) do a good one. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of decent recent zombie film. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you really give forgiveness, you may well think they haven't at least thrown something to make us feel like we don't want our money back? Guess what ... they didn't!
