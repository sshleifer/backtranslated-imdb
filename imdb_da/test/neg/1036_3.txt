Try as I might, I simply couldn't get into this. Maybe it was the washed out tones; maybe it was the drawn-out approach - I'm not really sure, but even though it wasn't a "bad" movie, I didn't find it very much to be an "effective" movie (words I understand so much more arbitrarily than Their General Applications.) So, essentially, the deal here is that a series of young boys die off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town that triggers a witch hunt. What does the boy's death have to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who has appeared in the city? Is that crazy hermit woman involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of crime drama and horror, as the various citizens are all suspected, and the bodies continue to appear while bloody violence occurs. <br /> <br /> Good enough, but for me most of it fell a little flat. Oh, it had those moments ... the one boy who went into a beautiful naked seductive was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers hit the hermit was a bitter comment (though the effects themselves failed when her skin seemed to peel off as if they whipped her with red-hot irons). My biggest problem was the end. I have already added spoiler tags to this review, but BE WARNING, THIS IS THE GREAT SPOILER: I don't believe it. I do not believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys to become sexually conscious without any hint of the psychosis that had previously occurred with other boys, with a story or other personal influence. The film didn't really get its end. END SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fulci is a big name and I am more than sure there is an audience out there for this. I absolutely need to check out that he is done because it may have been a bad introduction. Most Italian giallo is at least hit or miss, so I'm waiting to see what this guy can do before he writes him. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
