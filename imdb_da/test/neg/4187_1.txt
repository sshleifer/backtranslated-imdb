Well, push me sideways. I haven't seen a home video this bad since the unpleasant 13 SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take away this guy's Sony Handycam! This movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $ 20, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to. <br /> <br /> I remember one of the things Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a Crew", was that when you set out to make a no-budget feature, you need to Use the assets you have at your disposal. Rodriguez says you should create an overview of all the places and props you can ask, steal, and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was friends with the mayor of a city in Mexico, so the mayor let him shoot for free. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a movie that looked like it cost a lot more than the actual budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this movie has a copy of that book and he took the advice of the heart. In this case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a corn field, where they each year set a haunted house. Seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep a grain field interesting for 90 minutes. Not a single part of the kids in the CORN series spent more than a few minutes in the corn field. Hitchcock only used approx. ten minutes in one in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Take a tip, trap ... cornfields don't make for easier cinema. It would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more places because this thing gets pretty boring after the first 15 minutes. This movie seems to cost about $ 30 (or whatever it costs for accessing the corn market). He could not even find anyone to act in his movie, so he threw himself. Big mistake. Here's a thought if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. As far as assets are concerned, it appears that the corn market is the only thing the poor guy had. Maybe he thought it was enough. In fact, I go on a limb and say I knew it was enough, because before the capture of the coveted honor of being the successor to DARK HARVEST, the film was simply called THE MAIZE: THE MOVIE. Maybe he is already planning MAIZE: THE MUSICAL or even THE MAIZE: THE MINI-SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our Jack-of-All-Trades (and yes, the Master of Nothing part of that word is certainly appropriate here) plays a mental father who can tell when bad things will happen. Think of the character from DEAD ZONE, but not anywhere near as good an actor as Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. Mental father has a feeling that his two daughters who are in the maze's maze with mother will be killed. He hurries to save them. From that point on, the entire movie is spent watching Pyschic Dad run around in a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. He finds the two little girl ghosts from THE SHINING, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Shots of a $ 200 Handycam. The director threw himself. Edited on iMovie. Improvised history. If that's not enough to keep you away from this a-maize corny disaster, consider this as a last warning ... THE WHOLE MOVIA is in a cornfield, boiler and ghouls. Here's Ghoulie Guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel you've seen this movie. Next time you see a grain field, stop the car. Take a flashlight and walk around in there as for 90 minutes.
