The reason here is simple. The country's boy, Lem (Farrell) goes to town to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, Kate (Duncan), and marries her and brings her home to a hostile father and a group of women-haired farmers. There are shades of, they knew what they wanted and here and here. The courtship, which takes place in two long sequences set in the restaurant, is consumed the first half hour and is dull the pace. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to confuse his wife, made by Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the harvesters, to get away with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this boring pot boiler that lack the insight and the beautiful beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbone, so we run rooting for a "real man" (Mac) to take Kate away from it all. With the audience's sympathy crooked, the film loses its narrative progress. The father's conversion to the end of the movie is unrealistic and incredible, making it a sensible breakdown. This movie is for the stars of the stars and only the director - generally the audience doesn't have to bother.
