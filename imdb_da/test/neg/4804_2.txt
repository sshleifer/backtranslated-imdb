Virginal innocent Indri finds himself in a prostitution house run by ruthless pimp MG. Indri wins in prison in MG's private prison after she refuses to love him. Of course, Indri and the worldly top king are Helga together and plan to escape. Maman Firmansyah's soft, uninspired direction and Piet Burnama's dull, talked scripts thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality that this girl needs to qualify as a joyful piece of outbreak company. The sluggish pace pulls all the way through, there is no free female nudity at all (the girls do not even show skin under the mandatory group shower scene!), The expected torture and degradation are both extremely tame and lukewarm, the moderate crummy gore also fails to impress and even a ridiculous disaster sequence is nothing to be excited about. Thomas Susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the ridiculously twisted, the eerie overlapping 102 minutes of driving time, the juicy theme song and Gatot Sudarto's cornball score add even more eerie insult to already scary damage. Only some decent last-wheel-break-out action provides a slight relief from the otherwise overly abundant stultifying tedium. A complete gab-inducing dud.
