This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movies available and even better if not available. The Good: 2 Beautiful Lesbian Actress 1 True and Touching Story of Theresa Chan The Bad: The main story about the blind and dear woman, Theresa Chan does not have to be told in a movie format and more appropriately in a documentary format. No connection between the 3 lines. Minimum DIALOG in the movie, replaced by SMSs and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight into the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.
