The idea that someone might of such a pace, clich√©, but unconscious comic film, is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this movie are comic glory; with six men engraving enough ditches for 10 minutes to turn on the track with gasoline for a 747 while a presumably 'major' landing 747 in a 110mph crosswind - leading one to question the error of calling this movie CRASH LANDING ... part of the dialogue responded to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that rescued this movie for a 1 was the abundance of attractive women who fill the screen a great deal of time. Not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse for a movie, but my mute button finally received a training. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk! 2 out of 10
