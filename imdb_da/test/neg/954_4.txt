This chronic tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a mature role as the upper tongue. Jim Brown kicks ass effectively, Gloria Hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop who plays at the book. It is still boring and poorly constructed, and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated by its original James Brown score.
