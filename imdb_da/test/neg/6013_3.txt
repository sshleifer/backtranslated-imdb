This movie is called adventure in Cinemascope. It is as actor and director tooks Cliff's Notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a good vehicle for a movie about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue has no resemblance to Hemingway at all. This is a finished version of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. See the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. It is a fantastic cinema and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good in terms of his performance in For whom Bell Tolls, where he is stiff as a board and believes he is in a Western. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a Hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Your best bet is to get the unburned audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
