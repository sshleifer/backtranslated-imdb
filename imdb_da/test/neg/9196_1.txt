This is a bad, bad movie. Full of clich√©s, unrealistic moments: Punching the air in celebration after turning off, never remember someone has lost their homes and belongings !! announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your helpers before telling you privately first, go on the roof of a burning building without apparent reason, the stereotypical burials and strained conditions, the very risky cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion of the same occasion! ! Do they have a few tips on the ceiling or something !!? Anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke. It's a shame because firefighters do a great job, and they deserve to get a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
