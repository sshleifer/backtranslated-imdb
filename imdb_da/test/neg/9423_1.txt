I was told about this movie from a friend who saw it late in the week. He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went to an auction site and bought the movie. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. Terrible play and horrible story. Plus, he doesn't look like Michael Jackson? I still recommend buying this movie as one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can't bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say if the special effects are actually amazing ... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably right out when this movie came out, but if I had it, it would be a straight to VHS release yes people, it's so bad!
