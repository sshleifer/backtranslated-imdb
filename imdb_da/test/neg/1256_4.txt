Well, the movie wasn't horrible, but who created the play didn't do a good job of creating the essence of kids themselves. This film was slightly below average and does not properly tell the story on one of the most interesting people ever born. I suggest reading the book "One of a Kind" the real youth story. They released much of their life. They sometimes didn't understand the real caractor that he was. The actual facts of his life were sometimes out of order. And in the end they did not portray the actual personality he had. So please don't watch the movie; Read the book. By the way, I'm not just a dot that feels that you have to stay 100% in real history, but they didn't even come close !!!
