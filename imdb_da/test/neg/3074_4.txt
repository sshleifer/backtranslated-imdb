This TVM seems to have polarized opinions among the commentators on this page, so maybe I can settle everything by saying that this is a very stupid, not so well made TV movie. How bad is that? It's a tele-formula that can't even determine what the name is, because while everyone in America calls it LINDA, it's known in the UK as LUST FOR MURDER, and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name. And can I also point out that it is not a tongue in kindespoof as anyone else claimed. <br /> <br /> I want to be honest and say the plot is pretty sound. Linda and Paul Cowley meet with another couple called Jeffries, which they get very well with. They go so well that they go on vacation together (Make your own mind if there is any wife that offers), and Paul sees his wife kill Jeffries. After that the plot takes a shock twist. Writing the above paragraphs, I have suddenly realized the large amount of potential the story had, and I will not say anything to put you out of the premise. It's just that when history continues after the events I've described, things become more and more unlikely and bizarre. Not only that, but the production values ​​are quite unimpressive with the actor playing Paul Cowley and making a very wooden voice over what annoys, while most of the scenes - exterior and interior - look like they have been filmed on a foggy day
