There are many questions about making this movie. The first is: Why make a movie that plays like a little more than an awkward female fantasy? It's one thing to leave an audience with trouble to discuss the intent of a movie. It is quite different from going into the process of writing a script that does not address real human problems before they are performed on the screen. <br /> Why the monstrous melodramatic and often comic soundtrack? Why the exaggerated and often lumpy dialogue? Why is the protagonist's girlfriend one of hooded abductors? What purpose is there to reverse the main character's freedom from the abduction to a joke by getting him to complete his "mission"? (This is a classic Little Aussie movie moment. Resort for quirky comedy at the most inappropriate time.) Why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens? (This accounts for about 15 minutes of the movie, which is at least 30 minutes too long.) Why, if a man is imprisoned for so many days, does he not try to make a serious attempt to escape? <br /> The director, who wrote in the script, has in many cases failed to deliver a satisfactory story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
