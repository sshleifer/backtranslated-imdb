Although I tried to avoid German movies recently, positive reviews tricked me into hiring this one. There I am again fooled by German media who have hung domestic flicks again and again. It is no wonder to me that no one abroad wants to see this crap. The idea to make this movie is no idea at all (I think some fool read a women's magazine article about speed dating). In short: the characters (which are none), dialogue and content are so amazingly trivial, trite and clich√©-ridden. I continued to watch because I hardly could believe what I saw. BTW to call the flat papers delivered mechanically by the numbers (certainly from the aforementioned journals) will simply be wrong. Action is so over-the-top, I can't remember worse than that on the screen for a long time. You have to guess the manager had / has no clue at all. Astonishing distributors and producers around the country are still wondering why German films (with rare exceptions) do not give any interest worldwide. Why? Because it's a waste of time and money.
