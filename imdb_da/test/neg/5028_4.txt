Will there be an end to hyping movies dealing with social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay "Care" is about childbuse, "Care" is about perverts that abuse boys in a school, and how disgusting it can be if it is a movie with a bad script and made with bad player players, then it remains a bad movie . "Care" is a movie that could have been, but it is because it was a television I do not know, but everything seemed so limited that it comes across as some cheap movies that will be seen by some housewives and fathers who do not decide to go to bed. There are so many unanswered things in this movie ... the relationship with his mother, for example, or the death of an abused boy, from which we know nothing more. The "care" should have been much better.
