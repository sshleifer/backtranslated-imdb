This movie was horrible. The play was lame, but it's hard to know if anyone was working well, as writing was so poor. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst movies - I discourage anyone from seeing it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are going to see Cry-Baby, I recommend muffling it and simply ogling at Mr. Depp for and hour and a half.
