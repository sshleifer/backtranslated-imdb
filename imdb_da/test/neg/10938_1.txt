Oh my. Oh, this is a * really * bad movie. The action is absolutely horrible, the manuscript is godly, and photography is simply horrible. What makes this movie stand out is, however, that you never even care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead - for 87 minutes. "Oh, he / she died? Huh ... Got the wild" was the best response I could muster after every murder. Signs are so black or white that with the volume off, you can still figure out who was who. While the voices of the voices had a weird monotonous quality everywhere, their faces give the impression that you are looking at an old sound film with a lot of eyebrows, exaggerated fringe and "thoughtful look". Each character is a humorous, passionate, one-dimensional one-trick pony; When they meet what their particular role in this failure required their creation, they are summed up. <br /> <br /> It made me vague what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / writer of the "Shadow", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low budget version of "American Psycho" and was a little distracted along the way. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly cruel movie; The cold, passionless throw ensures it. It's not an offensive movie; The director plays so surely that no one can find it that way. It's simply and yet a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so lucky and actually paid to see this bomb on Pay-Per-View. As part of my fines, I write this review. <br /> <br /> Enough said.
