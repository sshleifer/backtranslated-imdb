This movie was horrible, clean and simple! Animation scenes had absolutely horrible graphics. It was very clear to see that this movie had about the budget for my merchant account !! The action was just as bad .. I have seen better performing in pornographic films. I would seriously like to return the hour and twenty minutes of my life. In fact, I registered on IMDb just so other people didn't get sucked into seeing what I did. Don't make me wrong, even though I love sci-fi movies! This one seemed more like an intro to a video game :( I'm glad I only spent one dollar to watch this! The storyline reminded me of the movie height, A prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes. Goodness .. what should we do ??? I would not even let this play in the background of my house while I was cleaning! At the bottom you can do better.
