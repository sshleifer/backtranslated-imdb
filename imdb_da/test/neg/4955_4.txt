If there's one thing I've learned from seeing George Romero's Creepshow, it's that if you stumble upon a mysterious old box that someone obviously made a lot of effort to hide, just leave you alone: ​​there is probably something ugly inside. /> <br /> Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, Robert Englund's character in Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer, is not a Romero fan because he breaks up with the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard because only to discover? surprise, an ancient demon who possesses his body (at first he makes him eat and vomit pretty much). When the demon finally breaks out of Crowley's body during chemistry class and begins to transform students into hell, swelling animals, it is up to the plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try to stop the wild creatures armed only with a tube length and driven of a lifelong hatred of all things monstrous! <br /> <br /> The DVD packaging for Jon Knautz's low-budget monster girl promises It's a fun trip that offers cheesy excitement and waste of the kind one might expect from your average 80's creature (toothy critters, rubber monster suits , cruel gore and absolutely no CGI!) and in the last 15 minutes, this is exactly what viewers get: non-stop splattery effects; a silly, tentacled Jabba-style demon tingy; and mucho macho monster mashing! It's a shame as the rest of the movie's running time? A massive 70 minutes or so? is mostly used by Jack as he goes about his tedious, everyday business: plumbing, visiting his shrink, going to chemistry class and disturbing his girlfriend. If you think you might like a movie that primarily focuses on managing childhood trauma and anger management, buying extra boiler valves from a hardware store and Sodium's chemical properties, then this is the movie for you; But if it's a massive dose of monster chaos you're after then I would advise looking elsewhere!
