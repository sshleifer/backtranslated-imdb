Most of the comments on this movie are positive so I thought I would try to correct the balance. I came out of this movie and wondered what was going on. I know now and still consider it a bad movie. I originally set up a dream sequence as it seemed too obvious. I was glad I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Movie auditors and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than to see how an audience can enjoy a movie. The 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. Within 20 years, this movie will not be compared to true greats like The Godfather. The film has fine performances from both leaders, but it is not enough to save the movie. (nor are they lesbian scenes!)
