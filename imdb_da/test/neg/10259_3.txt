I just finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Lurking Fear" shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, setting), this brief narrative follows point by point for the first 70 minutes, but then tries to inject its own "twist" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. Whatever it is, it is a much better fit than Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it's a horrible movie. Director David McCormick shoots the case with all the flair of an industrial card. I swear I might have counted two camera movements. The creature design is cheap (we speak the store bought masks here) but shot in a dark way (intentionally or not), where they are somewhat scary. The most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion, but McCormick fails to exploit it as well. File this under good adaptation, poor execution.
