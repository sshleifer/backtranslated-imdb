Roy Rogers (like Roy) and sidekick Raymond Hatton (as Rusty) join Teddy Roosevelt's "Rough Riders". Soon they will be suspended for the "Round-up" killer of partner Eddie Acuff (like Tommy) along the Mexican-US. limit; They discover scary gold runners in the process. Note how, even suspended, Mr. Rogers can get the Rough Riders to participate in his Round-up! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the better Roy Rogers westerns. The fighting looks like choreographed dances. Rogers sings / yodel's "Ridin 'Down the Trail", one of two fairly common songs; and a stand-out moment, overall. <br /> <br /> ** Rough Riders' Round-up (3/13/39) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, Raymond Hatton, Lynne Roberts
