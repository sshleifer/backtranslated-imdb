Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to see her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is a skipper on a boat and she keeps traveling with him. During this time she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris don't see the eye, and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a dull story. ..... it starts badly with George F Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunks in a bar. The scene continues forever and they are both terrible. It is also difficult to understand them. In fact, it is difficult to understand the whole cast. I missed entire sections of dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Of course, Garbo is something special when you are drawn to her every time she is on the screen and her presence gives this movie the 4 stars I have given it. But nothing happens - it's a boring story with awful accents. You do well to keep yourself awake.
