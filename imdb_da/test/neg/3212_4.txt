There are certain scenes in this movie (like the hero's first encounter with super-scoop Shirley Eaton), where it seems to be on the brink of breaking sexual taboos and making its premise (women want to rule the world by making men's slaves) justice , but it never dares. The result is a film without sexuality and a little tame violence. In spite of the chopped plot, the film is not too bad for its climax, where its amateurity runs tremendously (horrible editing, overuse of inventory). Worth seeing only as a curio. (* 1/2)
