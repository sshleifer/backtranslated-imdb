I would really love this movie, and not just because it had Aaron Eckhart in it, but I thought the premise would be cool because I enjoy movies and shows that are about cooks. The cinematography was good, but besides being turned into cooks, everything else is just very clich√©. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very annoying in this movie, although Abigail Breslin seems to be a little annoying in every movie she's in because she plays many roles where she is whinny. It has some decent flashes of cooking, but food doesn't really play a big part in the movie than I expected, which was a big disappointment to me. This film had some good potential, the molding was great, but they had just as little to work with. I like a good light heart romantic comedy, but it was just boring. And longer than that should be, because it felt much longer than it is. It's not a horrible movie, you just don't want to miss out on not watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
