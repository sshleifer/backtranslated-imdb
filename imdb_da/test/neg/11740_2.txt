* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was a fantastic movie, unlike anything in the past. Every shot, every camera angle, every shade was perfect. He didn't just break the rules, he made a whole new set. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler: There's absolutely nothing new, different or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant not only pays tribute to Hitch, he relieves any idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional way. I didn't mind Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and I thought My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question that is burning in my mind when it comes to restoring Psycho is: "Why did you do that, Gus?" In my mind there are only two reasons to make a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone has thought of a fresh, new approach to the material. None of these factors are present at all in the Gus Van Sant version of Psycho. Apart from the fact that it is in color and there is a scene where there is a mounting of disturbing images related to the possible inner dialogue of the title character (which I found unnecessary), there is nothing new here. <br /> In addition, I found the casting left something to be desired. Anne Heche was okay as Marion, but she lacked some vulnerability, as Janet Leigh portrayed in the original. I did not feel so sympathetic to her character because the choices she experienced seemed to be much less limited as a woman in today's society, unlike the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the beginning 1960. Vince Vaughn got a few laughs with his rendering of an incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I feel that Anthony Perkin's timing and nervous, haunted look was much more eerie. The only performance I enjoyed better than the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. She was excellent as usual and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character. To be fair, there is some beautiful camera work, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" where Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vivid shades of crimson. And yet, throughout the film, I had this annoying sense of deju vu. Haven't I seen this somewhere before? Oh wait, I've seen this somewhere before! Almost all scenes appear to have been copied shot for shot from the original. You almost get the feeling that the director made this film as a school project. "Look, I can also make a Hitchcock movie!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't already seen, see the original. It has stopped over the years and beats this bit of mediocrity, hands down. You will not be disappointed.
