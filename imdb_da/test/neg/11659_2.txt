All I can do is echo the feeling already expressed by some of the other commentators. This is God's city, meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless chew (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's became commercial) is quite convincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A gritty, realistic movie was sappy; or (2) a sappy, ABC afterschool special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Whatever it just flies, do you? Why has it received so much praise? As others have understood, it gets the "voice of conscience" from the west. Show us contrasting images of contrast to our fluffy, double-wide theater seats and 44 oz coke, and we will applaud in a heartbeat. But - oh do not forget that the candy coat it, because the real bitter pill of reality (as it is) is hard for us to swallow. I am terribly disappointed that this movie would receive so many awards and awards, especially when there are far more deserving film works out there. All I can say is: watch out for any movie that receives awards (Hollywood Oscars = sweeping, syrupy bar. Cannes Film Festival = beard, artless propaganda). To find the right gemstones you need to work hard on it.
