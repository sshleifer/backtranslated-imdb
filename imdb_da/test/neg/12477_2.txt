Back in 1994, Power Rangers had become a big franchise and t.v. US network leaders hoped to get into the action and came up with the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, where the evil Emporer Gorganus, resembling a homemade Darth Vader costume and his talking bird, looks like a rubber bid The fabric of toys comes to earth to invade it with giant monsters resembling rejections from a 1970s Godzilla movie. Fortunately, Nimbar a stranger resembling a huge piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth, Nimbar gives them all a tattoo of another star constellation that allows them to turn into buffering superheroes resembling dancers from a four-tech tech No music video, they could also be combined into a giant knight. Forty episodes were made. The US network obviously did not have the money to try to adapt a show from Japan as the Power Rangers did, and made this show on its own using the budget of a 1950's scifi movie. The battles are generic, the special effects are poor, and some of the sets seem to fall down. The actors pretty much understood how ridiculous the show was, and practically hammered it and overcame it. I can only imagine their shock when the show was canceled led.
