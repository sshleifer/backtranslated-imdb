Technically abhorrent (with sound "pops" between scenes) and awesomely amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit through and is likely to turn off most viewers; But the dialogue rings incredibly true, and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body to almost every scene, also gives a totally convincing performance. A curiosity, but the more polished "Trash" made two years later is a clear step forward. I suggest you see it instead. (* 1/2)
