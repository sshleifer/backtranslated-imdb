So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and silver lining was that the SciFi Channel had a marathon of dinosaur film that day - the "Carnosaur" trilogy, "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then I flicked forward on the remote to see which movie SciFi was placed in its glamorous Saturday early break. Some movies I had never heard of before called "Raptor". I was very excited. The movie begins with some teens running around in a jeep when disturbed and killed by a Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, it's weird, it almost looks like a scene in" Carnosaur "unless it was in the middle of that movie." Then I went through some really bad plays, and then a guy was sucked into entering an underground research laboratory where he was eaten by a cruel T-Rex. Now I'm like, "Wait a moment, it was also a scene in" Carnosaur. "Then, after I saw some scenes flatly skinned by" Carnosaur 2 ", I found out what hell was going on. So basically, Roger Corman & Co. scratched scenes from the "Carnosaur" trilogy to use as action scenes, woven into a basic "dinosaur-run-amok" plot, and attempted to transfer it as an original movie, ashamed, I don't know who I am more angry with Roger Corman or SciFi Channel to try to pass this on as worthy of prime-time slot, the only reason it was worth considering was to select the actors / actors resembling their "Carnosaur" counterparts The trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next .. As much as it hurts me to be a dinosaur lover, I have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating, because I feel completely ripped off.
