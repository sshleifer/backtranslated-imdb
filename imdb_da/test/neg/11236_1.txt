I had to watch this movie for a movie class, I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian but still got very offended by this movie. The film's foundation is racism, overall minority (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) Is depicted in a narrow way. The ban on the film in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and subjective design of Asians. In addition, there has been critical attention to the biography of Anna. Many critics claim that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good way. Some critics of the film and biography have even said that Anna has made the whole story. A horrible movie, but good for discussion of BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.
