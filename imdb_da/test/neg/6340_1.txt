It is sad to say that a movie is really awful and you are trying to find ways to say this. But it's a terrible movie. Gene Hackman is wasting time (and suspected many dollars) by replaying his most famous and often recreated role as "Gene Hackman". Otherwise, the TV actors get the chance to become movie stars and successfully resist the temptation. Patrick Swayze has a smaller portion and continued with bigger things that he must be forever grateful for. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a result of others reviewing, and I felt another view was deserved. You can't agree with my review, but at least you've been warned.
