Although I found it to be excellent and the beautiful cinematography, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. One of the essential parts of the novella is that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves, rather than continue. This is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledge accident. <br /> <br /> The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent. In the novella they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it seems that they are both invalid. Finally, Mattie and Ethan destroy their relationship almost to the destruction of the finals' power and poignancy. <br /> <br /> The change of the narrator as a preacher was an effective change. Neeson and Arquette are excellent in their depictions. Joan Allen was also wonderful, but her character was very much water from Wharton's novella. I don't expect movies to faithfully portray novels, but this one went a long way and in the process of almost destroyed the story. <br /> Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have read the book as you will get away confused and disappointed.
