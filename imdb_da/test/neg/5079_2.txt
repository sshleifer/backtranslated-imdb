I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with it - it shouldn't have been done. <br /> <br /> Don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers because I have to take a lot of plot holes here. <br /> <br /> First of all - the opening scene. It's the big big event that made the two semi-lead characters (Statham and Snipes) crooked. But it is boring and everyday. First, at the end, we will see what really happened, and the time you don't care anymore. Also - this whole event, where a bad guy and his hostage are killed, is hardly big enough news to fill in hundreds of newspaper articles, as featured in the film. <br /> <br /> So the banking job - it doesn't get out of the ground for a second. The bank robber makes some unnecessary references to chaos theory (which nothing has to do with the whole story, by the way). The way Statham is called on is very 'Die Hard With a Vengeance', but more boring. Then the things happening in the bank are strange and meaningless. - What's with the safety box. There seems to be some plot that unfolds there, but it doesn't. - Why go through the hassle of stretching two people when it leads to nothing? It involves a lot of preparation and it is not used at all! -Why doesn't the SWAT leader belong to the responsible officer when he tells them to stand down? <br /> <br /> It's only the first 10 minutes. It's getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> -The whole romantic / love interest story (with 'he was not just a better policeman, he was a better man's remark to finish it) is painful to see. It's just meaningless - why should Statham's character point to the change in the camera's position in the footage being reviewed by the bank. This essentially leads to finding the 'virus' that gets him all the money. -What's going through the hassle of forging some guys signature and killing him but then DO NOT kill the guy who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I could continue aged (really), but it's like this movie is ... meaningless. The whole script is a mess. The "clear" references to chaos theory are really ridiculous and quite pathetic. The reason "twists" can be seen from miles away, and the protagonists seem to be making mistakes all the time. It is really painful to watch a movie like this, where the audience is taken for granted as stupid popcorn crushing people, whose director hopes they will not see all the plot holes and the overall ridiculous script. The explanation scene at the end only adds to the insult. It's really, really not a good movie. In any way. <br /> <br /> People who see an action movie don't get what they come to. People who are going to see a cop friend's movie don't get it. People who are going to see a smart thriller don't get it. In essence, everyone gets the same - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
