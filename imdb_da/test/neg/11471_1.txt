Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the matter, which is mostly (and unfairly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even in its treatment of this Swoon over it does far. Worse, it twists, combines and straight out changes the details of the case, which will annoy anyone who knows much about it while managing those who are not familiar with it. While it's an interesting made movie, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 - horrible.
