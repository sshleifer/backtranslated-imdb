I don't want to comment much, what should I do? Stereotype characters, absolute ignorance of Colombia's reality, horrible mise a scene, poor color choices, not fun (it should be a comedy, and they expect you to laugh because some distant music is next to nonsense scenes), Very bad actors direction (if you see somewhere these people, I mean the interpreters, you know they are at least good, but see it so bad movies, it's impossible to guess it), you get tired of the music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it's rap song in the final credits .... pathetic, doesn't it? etc ... etc. It has been a long time, I haven't seen a movie so bad !!
