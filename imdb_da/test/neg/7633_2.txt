Rebecca De Mornay may be a fascinating beautiful actress, but for the parts she gets to play if you can't say anything good ... De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible trauma like a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she is an adult and has become a - of course, brilliant-shrink. She has an affair with Banderas that we suppose to be (once! Original!) A serial killer. Sometimes she remembers Bandera's mother-in-law Tippi Hedren's character in "Marnie". But I wouldn't count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and many governors desperately try to replace him. Here the director pulls all the stops to make an excitement with an unexpected end, but the end is so far out, it is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film contains the mandatory "serial killer conversations" in the "silence of the lamb" tradition, murder (people and cats), split personality and open end, if the crowds were to call more did not and they were right.
