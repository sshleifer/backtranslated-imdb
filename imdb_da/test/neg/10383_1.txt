Let me tell you something ... This movie crosses all the Troma laughs and makes the movies hands down, as it actually tries to come as a serious movie. From the horrible play ... "I knew I knew she was in possession!" ... until the priest accepts sexual favors and comes in showers with naked teens ... take this piece of cake the cake. I try to compare this with another movie just as bad. This can only be in a class entirely by itself. The kicker is apparently some cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was right for the actual situation. I did not know that people from Backwoods USA seem like full imbeciles. I'm not sure if I'm sorry to rent it or have stumbled upon a jewel of comedy. This was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I saw with my hand over my eyes half the time (while I didn't laugh so hard I was crying). The end simply didn't make any sense, and it took all the way together. If you want to see something so terrible, it's funny, here's your movie. If you want a scary movie on exorcism .... continue.
