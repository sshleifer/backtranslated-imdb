Today I had a real desire for a sci-fi movie and therefore I decided to check out Battlespace. Unfortunately, this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see the director, Neil Johnson, has directed over 500 music videos, and I suggest he goes back to it. Music videos are a perfect form of entertainment, and not everyone can cut it with making movies. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is probably the voice over. And that says a lot, as the special effects are often appalling. Voice over didn't work in Blade Runner, and it doesn't work here. The first hour or so is used to see the protagonist's walk through the desert, while her daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a good movie, but not that. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are simply bad, and they do not blend into the rest of the picture at all, so you simply do not believe in them. And absolutely all the frames in the film have been filtered, and not in a good way. Filtering used as an effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad. <br /> <br /> And what about all the gadgets that talk all the time and don't close!?!? If I had used technology as such, I would have become angry. I just waited for the guns to blur with: "I'm terribly sorry, but I seem to be out of ammunition." No, stay away. This movie is just not worth the time.
