Yes it is true. That movie is a terrible piece ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski's books in Poland seem the same. The truth is, Polish filmography cannot afford to produce fantasy films. It's a shame when you compare "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian" for example. I hope no one outside Poland will ever see this nightmare.
