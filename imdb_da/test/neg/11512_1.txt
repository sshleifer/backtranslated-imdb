For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this movie is quite ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen at that time was with the Ballet Theater, now the American Ballet Theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but apart from Dame Judith Anderson, the actor is amateurish and Checkov is all over the top .... embarrassingly so! I watched this movie at the age of 14 and at that time I had never seen a ballet, I was very impressed. But later in life, long after I had finished my own career as a dancer - I bought the videotape of it, curious about how it was after so many years. I couldn't believe how naive Hollywood could be about the ballet's world. But it was made in the mid-40s before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. The entire waste of Specter has now gone ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) who died at the age of 79 years. It was his only movie that was then held by a Chicago businessman ... so rumors go.
