Such a BS movie. It's just some stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a whole BS plot that is in no way related to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the production team has received more money from the people who ordered the movie than they could ever get from selling the movie. The movie's plot contains references to some of the right recent events in Russian and other parts of Eastern Europe, but puts them in such a way that they have nothing to do with reality. It seems that the film is a brainwashing agent that helps depict Russia as a place populated by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the USSR card instead of Russia when running news reports, showing a crowd of Ukrainian flags and commenting that there are Russian elections, etc. <br /> <br /> There are also many bizarre episodes (ie, a sign running around Red Square in Moscow, and for a second he is in the center of Sophia, Bulgaria).
