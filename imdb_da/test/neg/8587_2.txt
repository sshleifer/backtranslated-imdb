This noisy, dizzying football movie from director Oliver Stone seems to have all kicked in - all with William H. Macy, who could have tackled the role of Mr. Stone, team doctors or "fruit cake" sell grain. If you're a fan of foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden fallout, excerpts, phrases you can try out on two-faced friends and road-loving lovers. The movie is sometimes good as a lively background party atmosphere, especially in the first two hours; It even features some MTV-enabled music video scenes. <br /> <br /> ** Every Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
