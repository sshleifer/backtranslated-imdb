In the matrix of the matrix, this travesty of a loose-connect movie to VR has been released again with the tagline "The Matrix just got Deadler!", In a box with a very Matrix-inspired cover (still called "Expect to Die" though). Due to the choice of font, the roofline looks the whole world as it says "Beablier". Anyway. To complete the transformation to Matrix wannabe, they have spotted a VR battle scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character does not work in the movie. <br /> Overall, this movie is a travesty at all levels. Jalal Mehri is a horrible actor and does not impress with her martial arts. But his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this movie is simply the worst actor I've ever seen. It was clear that he was chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. Worst movie I've seen for a long time.
