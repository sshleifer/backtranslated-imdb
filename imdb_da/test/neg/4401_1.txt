<br /> <br /> Will not be long on this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring I have had to face since I started watching movies. The story was not advanced, nothing was explained about any of the characters. It felt like a non-movie. (Many people had already left the audience at this time). Many of the scene were totally unjustified and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The director should have studied movies a little more knowing that each sequence, every scene, must make history progress. He never did. <br /> <br /> The supposed fun moments were constructed, and few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor, I believe). <br /> <br /> The Jury in Cannes 2002 ..... does not know what the jury was thinking ... probably the "politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would have loved to love it, so the disappointment was even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
