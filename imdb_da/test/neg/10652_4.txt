I just bought this movie because I love donating to Operation Smile, the charity that the movie was based on ... but I found the film's writing to be very strange. It does not focus so much on Operation Smile or similar organizations such as The Smile Train and their herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, it concentrates on an American teenage volunteer, Katie, whose "overblown" life in Malibu, California, contains a mother who brings her to a doctor so she gets her pill before she sleeps with her boyfriend. What should this type of drug fight do, titles the audience? That is 2005. I would be more surprised if a malibu teen in 2005 was not disturbed and even though she is so and who cares? Contrast Katie is Lin's character in China, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one. Neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with, or even understand the motivation of, either the girl. On the other hand, the actors do an appropriate job of trying to play the bad hand they were treated by who wrote this ridiculous script. The best performance was that the gentleman played Lin's father, although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitle. Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!
