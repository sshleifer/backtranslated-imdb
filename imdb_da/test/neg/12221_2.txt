I didn't care about this, it also seemed confused for a documentary. The filmmakers also seemed to steer me towards certain signs, and yet I was completely unsympathetic to the protagonist because of what they chose to show me about him. <br /> <br /> This movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, but the movie fell flat because of snappy editing that didn't give the viewer enough time to understand each scene. The development of the story was dotted instead of showing the men in boxers or other things that were random with the story they told. <br /> <br /> I had recommended that you skip this one and just read this story.
