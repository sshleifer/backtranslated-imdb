First there was Tsui Harks Zu Warriors (2001), which is visually groundbreaking, but lacks much in acting and writing departments, now this film, which is visually almost as good as Zu (but no longer groundbreaking), but is even worse in the actors . It is really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the HK film industry. I think you should understand Cantonese to understand how badly and vulgar the dialogues in the movie really are. It's like some criminal children talking in the street, it's so bad. To make matters worse, the actors and actors see themselves as criminal children, and they cannot act even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this movie should be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HK, but has HK youth really become so brain-dead that they can't appreciate anything but such youth and vulgar play / writing? If so, it's ashamed to be from HK. I want HK filmmakers to learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a movie that is both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in actors and writings. And stop using young singers / idols / heartthrobs as actors because they can't trade many fans they may have in HK!
