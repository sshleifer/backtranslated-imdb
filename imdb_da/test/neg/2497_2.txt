Six stars for Paul Newman's portrayal of General Groves, negative four for the inclusion of a very fictional event where truth is well-documented. Michael Merriman didn't really exist. His character - or at least his fate - loosely builds on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He carried out his mortal "tail of the dragon" experiment in May 1946. This is a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts. If anyone died of radiation poisoning in Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it is quite possible that scientists would have abruptly stopped their work and history would have changed. Whether it is better or worse, we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added Merriman's character to dramatic effect or to deliver an anti-nuclear message. For a more consistent and accurate treatment of the events in Los Alamos during the Manhattan project, watch the TV movie "Day One" or even better, read the Peter Wyden book on which it is based.
