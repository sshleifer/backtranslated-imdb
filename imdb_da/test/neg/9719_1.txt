OK ... before I even begin the more or less constructive criticism of the movie, I'd like to say a few words that come from the heart ... THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!!! DO NOT GO TO SEE IT, DON'T HAVE, HOWEVER, LIKE SUCH BAND BANDS AND HIGH REACTIVES, KEY STORIES. So let's go to why I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is no story line. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery, that feeling was just not there. 2. It all looks like a big, one and a half hour for some kind of goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like "BSB" band ... All guys in school have perfect abs, no fat or ugly young people ... there is not a nice girl in the movie, not one. The main character is either wet in the pool or all sweaty in his bed ... poor guy. Must be terrible to go on a date sweat like that. 3. Can the guys do something good with their powers? Something good? Just like extinguishing the fire in the old barn or helping his friend who came into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing up in front of each other. 4. Wood effect. The protagonist has only two expressions on his face. Express the number one: sad. Expression number two: Try to look seductive, but still seem sad ... In the boy band there are 4 guys: The main character, his best friend who came into the accident, the blonde and the fourth ... what was the name of it fourth? I think he only spoke twice in the whole movie: Once in the beginning (he said that the jump from the rock using the "force" will not kill them) and the second at the end when he and the blonde lost the girl ... the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice ... Anyways, my judgment: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Guys - Don't go to see it. There is very little action, no excitement, no hot girls. Girls - at least the actors look good ... What I would advise you people is to get a soundtrack of this movie - that's all I liked about it.
