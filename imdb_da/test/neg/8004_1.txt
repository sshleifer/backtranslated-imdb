This movie could have been a hell of a lot better if they didn't use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they didn't start the movie with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were too many double crosses and plot phrases to make the movie credible. The movie deserves a 0, but since I'm not a 0, I gave a 1. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy, I'd rather point out my eyeballs with some rusty scissors than that watch this movie again. I tell you it was an hour and a half in my life, I will not come back. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a gangster movie, don't get it here. Instead, see "Great time" or "Lock, store and two smoking barrels".
