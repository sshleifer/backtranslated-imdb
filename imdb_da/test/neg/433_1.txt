Hello people, <br /> <br /> I can't believe that "Shades" from That Thing You Do took that role. I don't think Cory Feldman would have taken this role. This film was a fuming pile of fertilizer. Save your money and time and see all the top 250's. I swear I wanted to let go of the Blockbuster lady silly to allow me to rent this. Stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Mr. Hipp
