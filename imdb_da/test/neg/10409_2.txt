It's a beautiful little movie that is worth having time to find and see. It really speaks for all the earthly choices we all make every day, and (as an HG Welles story I can't quite remember) can live to want back. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly, but just as you begin to believe it has become boring = bang = it's over. And believe me, "punch line" is one you want to remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if manufacturers will make it available for purchase - or available online, but somehow "You're happy you took the time to grab a copy - I'm sure.
