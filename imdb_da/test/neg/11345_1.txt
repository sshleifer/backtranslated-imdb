Dude ... I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak ... but it's too much. The worst leading actress ever !! Not even David "Hot Pants" Boreanaz is able to save this crap. No wonder I never see Fox ?? it blows !! We gave it a try and it continued to suck. We saw four or five painful, disturbing episodes. I will kill the execs on the network so badly! Why is money spent on this drive?!?! I don't understand, and I don't support it, and you should never waste your time watching this show ... unless you like it when your eyes relax their socks! <br /> <br /> Crap. Crap. Crap.
