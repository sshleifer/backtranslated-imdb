<br /> <br /> Summary: Not worth the movie <br /> <br /> As an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to see the original movie and see that they had omitted many important characters. Fortunately, the film was a wonderful piece on its own. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in the hope of following two of my favorite literary characters further on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality, it's still a good story, and as long as I was able to separate it from the original, it was and still is fun. However, I consider the six hours I spent looking at the "Scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst tense hours of my life. Discrimination against some of the original features so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book also made this series of narrative history one of rape, mistrust, murder and malformed relationships that even the book Scarlett was away from. The cast for many of the characters refused to examine the features that were so well-formed in both the original novel and the film and even in the second book, and again leaving at least an incredibly decisive character. In the short story, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her alienated husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under cover to visit an extended family. Having come to an "agreement" with Rhett, she goes in to leave and continues to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Finally, she follows her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland to further explore the family's "deep roots", and eventually called "O'Hara", the family's leader. While her duties as O'Hara keep her involved in her city of Ballyhara, Scarlett goes out into the English landowner's world and instantly becomes a coveted guest with many of their parties. She, who, over and over again, has been despised by Rhett, finally joins Luke, the earl of the Fenton, until Rhett comes together in a clichéd "night-white horse" - a kind of rescue. "Scarlett" miniseries do not fail to do this justice themselves. The series of her fiancé and despised by her family show that Scarlett was thrown into jail after she was blamed for a murder of her cousin. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend someone who is considering spending their day looking at this to reconsider this decision. <br /> <br />
