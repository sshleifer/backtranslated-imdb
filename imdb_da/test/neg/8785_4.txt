Whoa. I mean, who. I mean, whoa. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, waaay back when I was eight, in 1996. CGI movie was then a rarity; and good even more. Also, when we listened to things called CD players. But I go down. I used to like this movie a lot, far back then, and until I looked at it again, I had real good memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All dogs go to heaven" is obviously a robot. But again I go down. <br /> <br /> Then I saw it again. This really isn't one of his best, I can say now eleven years later. I've seen many more movies, and I've got a little more knowledge. Now it is clear that the voice is good, I give it to them. Story's ... okay. I mean, we see it all the time. A LOT. But it works. The musical numbers are what annoying me. This would have been more at home in the eighties with these kinds of music tracks. In '96, most children had epic tracks, like the Lion King (which came out a year or so earlier, but anything) or things like that. You get showtours here, vaudeville style. <br /> <br /> The animation kind of hurt too. At times rude, and with others who completely change style and format with the shift of a shot, it is really hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like "All dogs go to heaven, but it could have been waking up better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
