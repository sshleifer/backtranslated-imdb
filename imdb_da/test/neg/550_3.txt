The final rate of the Karate Kid series is predictable, badly acted, and so bad it borders on the comfort. But not quite, it's just bad. At this rate, Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent, already in one of many episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage child of one of Mr. Miyogi's WWII friends. Her parents are recently deceased, and her grandmother successfully attempts to raise this young hellion. In step, Mr Miyogi will put things right. True to formula, a group of neo-fascist bullies, called Alpha Troopers, must be put in their place and a new carat movement, called Praying Mantis. As I said before, this movie is a mess and should be avoided.
