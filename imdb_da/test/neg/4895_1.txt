How do you make an incredible movie out of a story by one of America's most famous authors? Watch this movie and find out. Perhaps I will surpass author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed by "The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter" and also hoped for something memorable here too. Forget it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with her short hairstyles and clothes. I've never found her much to be excited about almost any movie, anyway. Rod Steiger preaching? How insulting is it? Unlikable characters, one after another. Well, maybe it's also the book, and I'm unfair to this movie. I'm not familiar with the story other than what I saw on the screen and it was so uncomfortable a movie that I could never recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> It's just a backward person after another in a backyard. Outside some good movie pictures here and there, there is nothing to recommend. How anyone could sit through 100 minutes of this is fantastic. <br /> <br /> I didn't even go into how badly this is done. There is good news: It was the only movie directed by Simon Cowell.
