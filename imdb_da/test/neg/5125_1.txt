I am a dance teacher and am looking forward to some good dance routines in this movie. How sad to have been exposed to such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had big problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repulsive. Beal's face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this is very inconsistent with Alex's very disturbing obscenity, especially in the obnoxious restaurant scene. She also has a tantrum temperament of a young child. It is very hard to believe that Nick would continue to come back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after opening the door to a moving car and chucking a stylet on him and choosing to go home - in middle of the road - with only one shoe !!!. And what about her idiotic behavior after night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30-year-old man goes for a girl who looks around 16. Yuck. <br /> <br /> As for the dance, I fear that this 80's style is completely dated. What on earth was the TV dance sequence around the club? Who would dance? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in a row! And even the famous final order is rather disappointing, especially in the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera's shot of her jump actually destroys it because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth did she do when she passed each panel and pointed to them? And, as many other comments have pointed out, she would never enter a ballet company on the basis of that audition - perhaps that is why they do not actually say at the end whether or not she succeeded, the closure being the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of 'Flashdancers' I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her awful costume and makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good pieces in this movie - ballet dancers stretch when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classic, and at least that helps emphasize the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was pause dancing on the street. I also liked skating parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old who lived in a remodeled warehouse alone? How did she afford the lovely bar and all the furniture? Where was her family? Was the scene in the "naked" club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney movie needs their head examined. And what happened to the skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said the movie was bad, but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep trying, and your dreams come true. See "The Little Mermaid" instead.
