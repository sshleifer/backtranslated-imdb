It is difficult to write 10 lines of copy about this so-called film noir. There just isn't much to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection and I have a large number of noirs. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid plays a hard guy in here. He's not one, I'd like to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. Still, he is a fine actor. Everything, including the film cabinet, is okay-but-not memorable. One thing that stood out: the sudden end. It was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see this under the heading "Hollow Triumph". I've never seen the movie called it. It has always been called "Scar." <br /> <br /> If you read about a "tense movie noir", etc., don't believe it. "Excited" is not an exact adjective for this movie.
