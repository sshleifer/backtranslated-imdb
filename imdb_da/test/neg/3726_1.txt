Waste of time, talent and shelf space, this is a truly immense movie. What are great leaguers like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd wasting their time in such waste? Criminals Reeves turns to his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) wedding and ends up leaving with the bride. A comedy, thriller, romance? I honestly don't know! Reeves is the head of the wood and casts Dan Aykroyd as a policeman so terrible that it must be seen to be believed! The only bright spot from a dark dark tunnel is Diaz and herself is not so good. Rent something else. Anyone involved in this mess should keep their head in shame and offer it to be lost in oblivion in the years to come.
