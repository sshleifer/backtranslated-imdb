A very hyped-up, slick, angular reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> They have fallen into "because it is modern, it must be hyped-up, lick, etc." trap. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" brought this idea far more successfully, but I really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece against edgy movie). <br /> <Just because this is a "modern" story, it doesn't mean the movie should look like a magazine ad or have anything to do with drugs or weapons. <br /> <br /> If the stairs were like subtle as the honeyed words, Macbeth would be a much more powerful movie. As it is, read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary some questions. Skip movie over. Or not, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the super long review. IMDb made me do it.
