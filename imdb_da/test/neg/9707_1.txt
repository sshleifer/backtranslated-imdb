If you've never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the BBC adaptation from 1995 or even seen a pop-up version of the book, then this far-fetched attempt to show this classic love story can be considered vaguely sustainable. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, this movie is to be remembered for its horrible acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic humor of Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who has clearly never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and grins through all the scenes and came across as being so pitiful that no one wanted to marry her! Darcy looked as if he were trying to remember his lines throughout the film, and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written. <br /> <br /> This version couldn't show the right pride and sermon that both Darcy and Elizabeth were suffering from, and at the end of the longest two hours in my life, who worried that they were coming together or not! Absolutely uncomfortable - even the few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this nonsense. I can't think of anything good to say about this movie except that it eventually ended!
