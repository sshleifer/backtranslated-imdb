A hard seller: The British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical scene drama to high-sounding WWII Shakespeare theatrical troupe, sitting with an old, blistering, brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his tether. The actor's exhibition assistant works diligently to get his master cut and cost for a production of "King Lear" (under an Air Raid!), But both men lose their grip on their upsetting situation. Based on the late years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this renowned production seems to be a wealthy haven for natural-minded thespians. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this time in his career, not at all older) seems too robust and quick to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sir's moods and clashes in a way that makes sense to us, so in a scene he stops a train with his governing echo, and in the next he is curiously falling apart . With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of lack of health and fitness, one would assume that a dedicated assistant would go a long way to protecting his boss (and his future), but serving Tom Courtenay confuses and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest. Courtenay, who played this role on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar along with Finney for Best Actor), is much more aligned with his role, and eventually his bleeding commands and confusion get the only real feeling in the movie. These two, fortunately, do not tick each other's heads, and scenario artist Harwood is cautious not to fall into a love-hat pattern (which might be perceived in the film's first act); but unparalleled by servants vs celebrity there is not much to see in this portrait except for the aggravation of narcissism hinted at what once was. * 1/2 from ****
