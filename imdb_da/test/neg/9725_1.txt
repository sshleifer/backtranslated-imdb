From the beginning of this movie, with the "The Lost Boys" ripping off the opening sequence, the bad thread of work and even worse dialogue ends, this movie slimmed down at a snail's pace. The "covenant" was highly recommended by some of my colleagues whom I am convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope it was meant and their taste is not that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, but still felt much longer. The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. They could at least have filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or battle scenes, but some decided (perhaps the director, but I don't know if anyone really "instructed" this movie) that it should be filled with some badly executed " artsy "camera shots and invisible scenes of" boys "swimming and getting into bar fighting. About halfway through this movie, I thought it might be more entertaining to base my head against a wall, and to free myself with this awful dirty feeling I had to continue to see it. . So I bash my head against a wall and I enjoyed it more than the movie! I saw it all the way to the bitter end and hoped it would eventually give me more enjoyment. No, my efforts were rewarded with "What about I make you my Whee aytch!" I vomited, and then I just felt embarrassed by the screenwriter and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drive. The actress was really not as bad as other reviewers seemed to think, but even the most talented thespian couldn't save this work and work it on my nerves! I give movies a chance, even bad, because they usually offer some kind of enjoyment, and that was actually not the worst movie I've ever seen. After it was over, I felt like watching the movie "Stealth" again and WOW it was so much better this time! Oh yeah Case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't. See a few episodes of "Charmed" and see "The Lost Boys" after having a lot of alcohol and you will be a much better person. If you fall into the same trap as I did and looked at the "Pact", be sure to keep all sharp objects far away from yourself, you will thank me for it.
