Gotta add a comment on this! <br /> <br /> Firstly, one must ironically add "spoil alert" to comply with IMDb's parameters, but there is absolutely nothing here to be "spoiled." <br /> <br /> There are six characters: the great gal whose A-list mountain guide in the "climb" area and apparently among all the guides (including Mt. Everest Sherpas) on the planet; her lost love, which disappeared from the title, passes two years earlier, as the party reportedly seeks, but never finds; her shop owner friend, also a guide who may be better than a Sherpa but no fight for her; the strange lead actor who engages her services and says they will find her long-standing love in the bargain; his one union, a computer hacker with allegedly unlimited expertise, of a level sufficient to allow Gates to seek advice from him; and his second colleague, a bodyguard, who apparently has an IQ, not even close to three digits. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, scary goings-on, and the leading actor's secret mission is to recover a satellite that has fallen into "Pass" and has world-wide and unique data to bring them countless riches . Exactly what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> Overactive abounds, the script looks like something that can get a C in a freshman writing class (but a F if posted on a higher level), and thespians gnaw each a piece of scenery as a horde of beaver. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspects of this movie for me were joining portions with three other flicks or roles I've seen. <br /> <br /> First, the mysterious, unresolved secret data makes a recall "The Spanish Prisoner", an A-list / Mamet movie that surrounds a valuable business "process", never specifically clarified but better for it . Finally, not here. <br/> Secondly, the lead cake might have been even more resourceful as "Rambo" traded quickly when it was threatened later in the presentation. Third I remember a Steven Seagal flick (not remember the title) where he was semi-conscious and was for approx. 1/3 of the time and full comatose for another 1/3. Although I have not tried to see much of his work, I have seen enough to have noticed that he came up with the best work he ever has, and most in line with his laconic persona. In this opus, the young hacker may have become the most engaging personality on the screen while he was motionless and incapacitated in the latter part and unable to radiate, he gave the best acting during this seemingly endless two hours. /> <br /> Take the thin, silly basis for a plot here. Imagine it being compressed to, for example, a lbit on SNL, with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in the four roles. They could get record laughs with few changes in the dialogue here. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of the last analysis is considering what information might have been in the spy satellite to be "even billions" to any of many nations, yet worthless (according to guru hacker) if They are simply placed on the internet without any significant consequences then? Even a turkey like this should have somewhere a little trace of logic. This one is completely bare.
