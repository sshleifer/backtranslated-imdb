See this movie in examples I thought it would be witty and in good spirit. Unfortunately, it was a standard case of "the funny bits were in the prevewe", not to say that it was all bad. But "the good bits were in the preview." <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a youth movie that puts you in bed, watch this movie.
