Why was this movie made? What were the creators of this thinking?!?! The first 8MM movie had at least a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first movie was about the snus movie industry. This sequel is about ... keep on ... the porn industry !! Yes, as if the snus movie industry, an industry where people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment, was even in the same league with the adult film industry, an industry where people are filming other people who engage in unstopped sex acts and erotic situations. The idea alone should warn you about how badly the idea for this movie alone is. It is not helped by lack of plot, character, action, direction, script, logic, theme or even sound design. This is a remarkably boring movie that never once kept my attention. Literally nothing works. Why would a mysterious thriller about the porn industry involve murder and fraud work anyway? I don't have much interest in adult movies, but I've probably seen them before. Why would anyone make a film about the evil in it and that they would do it in a sequel to a snus movie? I don't even know if there is an industry involved in snus film production, but I don't hope so. The idea of ​​a snus movie alone is horrible, and only people who are really sick and bad will be part of it. I don't think the adult film industry is about murder and torture. I am pretty sure many people make pornographic films good intentions rather than hurting and killing people. It is never okay to hurt another person. The adult film industry is not about hurting people. It's about creating movies that are for me, a diversion and a waste of time. What is this movie trying to say? It does not work.
