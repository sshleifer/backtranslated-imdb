Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, not so grieving widow of the manor on the hill, telling her story to a television rep in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the well-heeled horse sets of society, she is suspected of being involved in the death of her elderly man. It is James Brolin who trusts as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Regardless, it is far more romance than mystery, and a very well-known tale. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a gold digging hospice nurse? It could happen, I think. And it's good to see Brolin in a significant role after his titchy trip in Antwone Fisher, though he doesn't make it to the end of the picture. The end of the picture?
