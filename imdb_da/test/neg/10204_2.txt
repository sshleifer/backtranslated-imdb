Hulk Hogan plays Rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend (Joan Severence) is kidnapped by bullies who force him to take over another wrestler (Tiny Lister Jr.). The bottom of the barrel action is such a mistake that even Hogan is ashamed to be in it, and with the evidence portrayed, he should be.
