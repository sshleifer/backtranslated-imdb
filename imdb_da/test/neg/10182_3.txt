Wow ... just ... wow. There are many reviews on this movie already, but I would like to add some own comments. I agree with most reviewers who have said that this movie has horrible acts, writes and manages - which boy ever does. However, I think there are some other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does Christian faith and the addendum to extraterrestrial life exclude one another? The movie seems like you just can't be a Christian and also allow the opportunity? Why? They so briefly touch so much in the film (ie, "The Bible does not say there are foreigners." "Now the Bible does not say that there is.) But the true re-affirmation is never answered. The Bible really does not say that So what about dealing with the question rather than dismissing it? Or better yet, recognizing that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God who is the possibility that he made another life a place and have their own plans for them. <br /> <br /> 2. How come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid, demons and hoax? What about sleep paralysis and night values ​​that have been associated with abduction experiences? What if it's totally different? Too bad, the filmmaker has already got their thoughts up. <br /> <br /> 3. The filmmakers claim that everyone who has had abduction experiences has ties to the occult. requirement to make without any actual proof to pre I do not need shelter argue that they do not, but if you want to say something so asinine, you would better have the facts to back it up. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy, the other) always have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take anyone seriously when they constantly play pocket pool. <br /> <br /> I wish it had been an exploration of Christian beliefs and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately, the filmmakers were worried about their "beliefs" to make a thought-provoking film. As a Christian myself, this takes care of me.
