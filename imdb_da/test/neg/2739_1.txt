Ordinary horrible movies ... I don't want to bother you about synopsis, just put together The Core, Armageddon, an evil plan Military Officer and one or two Solve-All Nukes, and you will get the movie if I can call that way . <br /> <br /> Seriously, Nukes in this kind of movie is more useful than the Swiss Army knives: The Great is approaching? Nuke in some places and it's over ... A tornado wants to destroy "Insert important city names here"? Nuke "Insert another important city here" ... A volcano is outbreak? Nuke it! A key is about to go off? Nuke it! The coffee is cold? Nuke it! You didn't like Transformers? Nuke yourself, but I cannot assure you that this will fix things ... <br /> <br /> Finally, how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying each other? I doubt there are many things to blow up with a key ...
