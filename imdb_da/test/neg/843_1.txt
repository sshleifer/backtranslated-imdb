This should be based on Wilkie Collins '_The_Woman_In_White_, but the only similarity to that story was the characters' names, the time period, and the settings. If they were to change the story so thoroughly, I do not understand why they needed to keep up the estimate it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. That is much better.
