Walt was especially fond of quality. So how come the Disney producers to release such a horrible edited, roughly acted (even for family prizes!) Rod on a movie? The big green had a good concept. And since it's Disney, you know how the movie will turn out of course. But the big green is horrible. The wit is paralyzed. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, draws on another horrible performance on his resume. <br /> <br /> Children with too much time on their hands in the small town of Elma are offered an opportunity for their new teacher to play football. The kids don't know anything about themselves. And gracious to us, we see that Steve Guttenburg is trying to turn on the teacher from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The fast camera work doesn't work. The big green is full of faster pace to move the movie together. Children are not idiots. They will catch if you give them enough hint without showing all that waste. Guttenburg, once in his life, should have offered an offer to participate in this film. Also the beautiful Olivia d'Abo should have called this one too. The big green can be called 'The Big Bomb'.
