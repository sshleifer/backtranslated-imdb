Though it would be easy and precise to go into why 'Reba' is at the center of indicating many 'family-oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms, the real truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes from more fun and more groundbreaking shows, and the star is completely out of her element. Although I'm sure Mrs McIntire can sing and have a fan base that supports it, being in a sitcom shooting out singers and calling her, the next Lucille Ball is far removed from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba herself has no presence needed here to determine the fact that she is cast as the intended woman, of which all her family is centered. But after seeing a few episodes, there is no real connection to the sign. I could do less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence and to make a show around her it seems very short-sighted and indicates most "family-oriented" programming: pushing a sitcom full of men's stupid / female stereotypes that appeal to none but those who cannot afford for cable. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it has at least better production values ​​than your standard PAX ripoff .... just.
