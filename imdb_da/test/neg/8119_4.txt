Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the newly-deceased Japanese businessman's beautiful adoptive daughter, inherits control over her father's business; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), mistrusted that he was not left to run, orders a hit on his niece. When the jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks into his mouth Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is wrong for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls for the beautiful heirs and ends up defending himself to protect her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo's men, while Kensuke is busy playing an arcade game with cop Daniel (Sam Lee). Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the company, but runs to a spot of disturbing himself when his gangster threatens to reveal his illegal activities unless he gives them complete control. Meanwhile, Kensuke, along with two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo), are hunting. He teaches Kung Fu and tries to release Yumiko. <br /> <br /> A blend of broad slapstick humor, spoofery and battle scenes, No Problem 2 is a disappointing movie considering the talent involved: 80s Kung Fu Superstar Yuen Baio manages a few battle scenes, but today becomes a little old for acrobatics; director kar lok chin delivers the kind of stupid parody schtick i would expect from a scary movie movie; Jung Yuen resorts to mocking his character in Operation Scorpio; and sam lee ?? Well, Sam Lee is as annoying as ever! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, like gangster Ben, impressed me; He has a distinctly strong screen presence that has not been unnoticed by Hollywood? He has since starred in two of the Matrix films and will soon appear in D.O.A., directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed with Wakana Sakai, but for a very different reason: this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film industry. There is something fun to have from training which movies are being parodyed, but in 104 minutes I found this movie a real task to sit through. If people draw funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects, you make your pages laugh, so no problem 2 can appeal to you. Otherwise I would go well alone.
