This movie is a shame, especially considering Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but professional director. But this movie fails to deliver everything you could expect. First of all - I'm Polish so I can tell the whole background story because I read books. But how do you know that there is even a war from this movie - a lot of people go back and forth, some soldiers are shouting ... This is really second world war or soldiers are on holiday? <br /> <br /> Action and dialogues - poor, miserably poor. A.Å»mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest of the (Polish) cast is out of place (especially M.Ostaszewska, one of the leading figures what an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogues are not spoken, they are just put there, the actors had a hard time performing, and it is not surprising to consider what odd things they might say. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the most disappointing problem - you can't feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling in it. There are a lot of original World War II recordings, and guess what the material is much more powerful, dramatic than what A.Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I can only see a positive - despite historical errors (like acronym ZSRR; it was made after propaganda after 1945, to please Polish, that ZSRS was gone and now there was ZSRR, but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!) fortunately it has undoubtedly been shown that killing in Katyn was made by Soviet (yes, it is a fact, not a controversial gossip). Great, two hours in a 5-10 minute scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway - time and potential wasted. This is a tragedy of epic proportions that will fight in 1939 (barely shown), not to declare war on the Soviet Union by Polish authorities (see here not shown), imprisonment of soldiers shortly after, living under the monstrous conditions ( not shown here), hope and fear what comes next (barely shown), and then ... extinction. Hand to hand with Germans - Soviets exterminate Polish nation, targeting people who made up Poland's backbone. Unfortunately, they succeed and the results are still visible for this day.
