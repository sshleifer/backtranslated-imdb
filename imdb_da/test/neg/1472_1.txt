I usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes, but it's a bad joke. I wonder how this can be called a movie. All these people are looser, and the filmmaker fails to make them interesting. They are not funny, not tragic just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> May I be missing something, but I won't see it again to find out what. Anyone with a camcorder can do better than that ... I give it a 1 for the originality. The whole rest is crap.
