I really wanted to like this movie, especially after all the buzz I had heard about it. But unfortunately it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did - If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on slow motion close-ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will come so deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this movie is constructed. I was not impressed that "writing it all down" confessional is the way the protagonist deals with the accident - so what should we believe in? He grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences, thus becoming righteous for the horrible event? What I suppose to be a movie that evokes empathy for a young man who is pointless and confronted with an impossible moral quandary, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him, and at the end of the movie has no real sense of what is right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit that simply throws through life as he weaves his way along his skateboard. I don't feel like him at all, and I honestly want him caught. The whole film does not necessarily center on his feelings of guilt, but on how he will avoid punishment and / or responsibility for a bad decision. He doesn't just get away with what he finds a way to subtly rationalize it. Quite frightening, negative message, the proposal is that so many of our young people are so disconnected from the right and left that they simply make up the rules when they go together and make good or sick. I find it an abusive treats of today's youth, and the filmmate's pretentious arrogance kills heavily with every plodding, overthrow and changing eye. <br /> <br /> (He killed the guard, but if you blink your eyes you miss it. Whether it was an act of mercy or not, it's hard to say - it might be that he was so met, he beat with the skateboard. When he runs to the security guard car, one of his skateboards is colored with blood.)
