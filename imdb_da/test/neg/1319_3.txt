A truly wonderful cast and highly talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time and our equally valuable leisure time, generating support for this completely predictable and clearly formal part of commercial junk. The film is based on a really good and very current idea, but both the producers and the director simply used the standard Hollywood 'disaster film' formula and thus destroyed any potential value from the production. <br /> <br /> An exceptionally high tides and very strong storm springs combine to produce a record-high storm wave that overwhelms London and overflows most of the Thames. The priest is centered around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who warns the authorities about the danger and ultimately saves the day, a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an ambassador president (David Suchet) who tries to look important. <br /> <br /> But it is so unreal that you feel like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes. The young glamorous female police officer demands full authority over the army during a declared emergency and gets it (as if!). The experienced General just pushed aside as a perfect moron to lick his boots because of his obvious superior capability. The problem is that our female supremo, now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters who have taken a trip to South West London and have not called that they were okay. So our mighty woman sets her staff to look for them and decides that the only priority for the whole army and rescue service should be South West London and not the second quarter of the city. Of course, ministers, the army and the whole entourage accept her priority without question. One can only assume that they all had property there. When her children are eventually found after infinite reports and efforts by her staff, she is told by our male hero, "God God, they are sure, that's the most important thing". Never mind the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she had to control as long as her own children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This film is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist clapper that women are the clever, attentive, caring and clearly clear leaders, while men are good for nothing except physical courage mindless strength and a lot of specialist knowledge. And yet the one simple instruction she could have given the population; namely to go to the nearest tall building and quietly walk up to the 4th floor or above and await instructions when the waters were not given by this female superhero - or anyone else. The whole problem was so easy to solve and yet millions of people didn't just think about going upstairs! Pathetic waste.
