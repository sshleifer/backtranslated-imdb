I find it hard to understand what makes the viewer feel this is a powerful movie. I would guess that the primary purpose of this movie would be a character study and the effects of racism in a British society. It is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional, and the play is on par with a college-performing arts course. I'm always skeptical of "improvisation", another word to be too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience that laughed as they probably had to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think a subtle approach in the cinema seems far better than putting it on with trowel.
