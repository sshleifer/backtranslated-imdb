Now I have to admit that this movie occasionally laughs in my face. OK, but it doesn't make a good movie. Most of the characters are horrible stereotypes and really convincing. Not everyone gives good plays, but some really try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: She changes her eating habits from one talk to the other. On a talk she does not drink alcohol on the next, she is allergic to champagne, she feels too beautiful for most (in fact she is) but finally ends with the "perfect" fit in appearance and refuses to give any more " realistic "fire a chance, etc. The end is very cheesy, although I like one of the last scenes when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again. The shop is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughter (mostly because it's about sex and relationships I suppose) and maybe a short entertainment. Yet the whole picture is a great stereotype, and nothing really is special about it.
