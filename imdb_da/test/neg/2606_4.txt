When Family Guy first premiered, I was not in a discriminating mood. With the 1990s containing a wealth of wise, surrealistic cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Clean and Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life among other fine cartoons (Yes, this includes Spongebob). Everyone had quirky, dreamy animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogue. The Simpsons became a direct phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its greatest defenders claim to be, but a very fine investment of your time and certainly rejects the false axiom that all television is undesirable. South Park started out as a raw but fun attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath. It evolved to become a Monty Python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally fast and sharp community criticism (like their defense of the noble underpants) and finally, to be completely self-explanatory and "meta" as the Simpsons did and have jumped unfortunately the shark. Family Guy is superficial like The Simpsons and South Park. It pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. But what it has in loquacity is lacking in true wit. <br /> <br /> The show is known for the use of gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or advertisements. Some are fun (especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are references inherently fun? I'm not sure, but they are mostly what the show is on, as its signs are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has an artillery of self-consciousness and sheer monstrosity to back up his horrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a tall, uncomfortable pig. Some fun that comes from his character is only because the authors forget how to be unfunny that day. Lois is also very low and dull; Me is an attempt to be abused; Chris is cross-border and only occasionally fun, and the show's two biggest stars (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that the whole thing is really pointless. <br /> <br /> Other gimmicks I can't stand are when a sign points to something of course and lingers on it for an unpleasantly long time. This happens a lot lately, and I can no longer hold it. Not only the often mentioned chicken who likes to beat Peter up, I am talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are foreign spectators. It is not white or even ironic humor, it is completely boring and lifeless. Not that the show can't be fun, in fact some of the previous episodes had me rolling. Highlights include the pilot episode where Peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious TV; when Peter's religious enemies are discovering and breaking up chaos; When Peter gets fooled at Meg's school and "pancake" episode. I suppose it is those episodes that accidentally incorporated the actual human traits of its characters, or just times the authors actually had comical inspiration. One last thing is the show is not offensive. It is only offensive to those who would not see the show in the first place, so it is almost like a circle scramble to the hipster.
