Sure, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We'll get it. Over ... and again. What stood out was that the filmmakers focused almost entirely on the more "extreme" characters in these small town gay bars; the dragon drones, the seedy sleaze of a bar long closed and on a guy who was brutally murdered to be gay, but had nothing to do with any of the pillars that were the focus of this movie. <br /> <br /> There were excerpts of interviews from other people, perhaps viewers would be better able to relate to. But they were glossy, virtually skipped, perhaps in a glimpse of the background. It would have been more interesting for me to at least hear the experiences of the more ordinary gay men and women who were either enriched or otherwise enriched by the experience of a small town gay bar and / or the absence of that community.
