This movie is not at all like God's city, you can get the same feeling, but it is not, there are no intense shots or intense drug scenes you get the idea. If you ask me, I think this movie was a waste of time, there are many other movies that give 100 times better meaning and education than "Wooden Camera". Yes, I may be the only one to make a negative comment on this movie, but it is only in my opinion. It's one of those movies where I can get the feeling that I'm going to blow away, but when the credits start to play, my friends and I all returned, and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. was. So to conclude this question, I do not recommend seeing it. Personal Note - Making Africans speak English was a big mistake. In the city of God they used their mother tongue, which gave the film much more power and reality.
