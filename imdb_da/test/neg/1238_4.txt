I'm not sure this review contains spoilers, but I play it safely by stating that there may be. Regardless, it is unlikely that anyone will see this movie, which is not familiar with the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old wisecrack about working heavily and producing a mouse. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. The novel focuses more on Indians than the Americans. By adapting it to television, McMurtry and Osanna justified that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel that we do not already know about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. So the movie mostly gives us a gigantic prehash of what will happen in "Lonesome Dove". The Indians - who have their own story to tell - are very much referring to the background - so much so that one who has not read the novel will rightly wonder why it is called "Comanche Moon". <br /> <br /> The novel has no overall story line, or much of a "point". This could have been aimed at the movie by drawing more strongly the contrast between the Indians who lose their land and lifestyle to the appealing Americans who bring "civilzation". This option was missed. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Lonesome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has extended scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. The extended scenes with the Indians have been removed or shortened largely. And for a (net) four-hour movie, it is remarkably episodic and choppy. You get the feeling that the manuscript was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs. The manuscript mostly consists of clich√© dialogue, theories and platitudes. Coming from the author of "The Last Picture Show", it's an incredibly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna were able to solve problems with the story and characterization, but it did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogues from the novel are missing or changed, for no apparent reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred of Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) to always run off with his "pair". The tiny little revelation of Clar's sexual jealousy is gone. Then there is the scene where the clogged Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon "compromise" her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and harder; the film tones it down and does not show Woodrow as the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (When I read that scene in the novel, I would turn Woodrow into the stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of which are understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut; Doing so would have required expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! (It might be unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to change such a large prosthesis.) And Buffalo Hump's character is "kindler and gentler". He is almost not as cruel as he was in novels. The only good thing about this turkey is Steve Zahn's remarkable achievement - not as much as Gus McCrae, but as Robert Duvall plays Gus McCrae. It is scary. He perfectly duplicates Duval's ways and means of speaking without ever having "consciously" or self-consciously. As Duvall, he is completely "within" the character. And he actually shows that Gus becomes "more Gus" in the third part. The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it will not spoil our love for "Lonesome Dove", not just a great Western but a great American movie. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who think Rachel Griffiths was over the top - that's how she was in the book.
