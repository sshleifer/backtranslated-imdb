I can't figure out what Jon Voight might have thought when he became involved in this tenth rate, incoherent, pretentious, indifferent slop. He helped write the alleged "script" himself, and he should be cursed and ashamed of it. The movie (I can't call it a "movie" because it hardly moves) is a rattling, embarrassing pretentious drive - like a really bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. It winds its way back and forth from the Middle Ages to today's Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the magic of his evil brother and somehow transfer it to modern times when Voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil business executive. If the bizarre casting (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) is not enough to kill it, the stupefyingly inept direction, the leached photograph (it seems that it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera), the almost complete lack of editing (scenes continue either infinitely or chopped in the middle of a sentence), and Voight's embarrassing, seemingly power-conscious "acting" is enough to bury it, which is exactly what should have been done with it. A downhill experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
