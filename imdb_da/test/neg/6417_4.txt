This is the worst work ever in Daniel Day Lewis ..... I can't believe that in the same year he made this horrible movie and my left foot ..... Stay away from this movie .... this is a film only for Argentinean people as a curiosity ... The reason is impossible to understand ...... The author thinks that in argentine all the people speak in english ... Of course, patagonia provides a very good framework for photographing the movie, but is not enough reason to watch this movie .... I repeat, only if you are a fan of Daniel Day Lewis or if you want to see the south of Argentina, part of Patagonia and you have not enough money to raise yourself .......
