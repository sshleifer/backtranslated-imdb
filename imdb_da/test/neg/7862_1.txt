Wolf's curse starts as restrained. Werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) manages to escape from her package and into the city, where she works 6 months later in a veterinarian. The rest of Dakota's package is miserable and wants her back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says she will come back to them, but obese Werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up her scent and the package decides to force the problem and Get her back using her feelings for her human friends, including her boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of his Werewolf pursuers? I doubt you would like to ... Executive produced, written and directed by Len Kabasinski, who also had a big role in the movie as Stick, I was horrible and looked at Curse of the Wolf since Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fear was confirmed, and it must be said that Curse of the Wolf is a truly horrible movie in every way, both conceptually and technically. The fake of the wolf is the kind of movie where the low budget dictates what happens and the script rather than the script dictates the budget. You get the impression that everything was written and conceived to exploit the few sets and actors they had. You can almost imagine that the decision makers say we've got some actors, some basic equipment and a few places so we can make a horror movie around them. The story is horrible (Michael finds Dakota's location by looking at a big dog, two women taking a trip), the character is horrible (a great fat Werewolf guy who runs a lot), the dialogue is horrible (almost every line of things) and there is never any motivation for something happening (why is the package so desperate to get Dakota back?), people just seemingly do random things, and since director Kabasinskis background is in martial arts he insists on inserting lots of random martial arts combat sequences in the plot. No offense, but it's supposed to be a horror movie, not a martial art, isn't it? In fact, apart from the presence of a few werewolves, you would be hard pressed to describe Warning the Wolf as something approaching a horror movie. In almost two hours in length, it feels like it is going forever and is so slow and unintentional, it's just not fun. Director Kabasinski of course worked on a low budget, but film making this bad must be a crime. There is no continuity between shots, the battle scenes look awful and are so poorly staged that it is false and it is sometimes impossible to follow what is happening, it is because of the choppy editing and bad camera angles or the fact that sometimes it's so dark that you literally can't see anything. Seriously there are times during the wolf's curse, where the screen is completely black and you can't see anything I would hate to have to sit through this watch it on a fuzzy low-resolution VHS. The sound is also terrible, you can hear the wind and the wind against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and undesirable environmental sounds under almost every scene. Does the production actually have any lighting equipment while it is being done? It doesn't feel like that. The special effects consist mainly of werewolf masks that look like the kind of business selling for Halloween for the kids, basically they look awful. <br /> <br /> The technical curse of the wolf is just as bad as they come, sorry because I know this had a low budget, but it's really awful to sit through and try to get some entertainment from. This is high school movie student quality, I'm sorry if it sounds unsuitable, but it is a fact. The action is good, you can guess so I stop myself here before I say anything else negative, I think I've done enough of it already, and I really have no pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> The curse of the wolf is terrible, both conceptually and technically this is a real task to sit through. The fake of the wolf is that type of film, whereas while you see the time seeming to stand still, it is the type of film that lasts for almost two hours, but feels like two years. One of the worst movies you or I will ever see, definitely one to avoid.
