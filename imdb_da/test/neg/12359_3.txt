So I caught this one afternoon as "What Lies Above" and actually looked at it because the beginning was something promising. Heroine Diana Pennington is a mountaineering expert ... but it doesn't help her when her fiance Brian gets injured on a climb. When she goes out to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she's not close to the Snowman's Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her he can find the body of his lost fianc√© with a new satellite program. She agrees, and they take up the mountain with Curts two assistants: his "bodyguard" Hugo and the computer wizard Tyler. From the start, you know that there is some ulterior motif going on, but unfortunately the twists are not good and leads to a ridiculously bad chase sequence that constitutes the last 20 or 30 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The major disappointments are the red herring, most of which have supernatural undertones that will never benefit. The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), is the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable of them all: the dream sequence of Diana halfway through the movie. But what disappointed me most is where they lost the ball. The majority of the film is about the search for Brian, therefore I cannot begin to understand why my mystery about what has just happened to him and where he was, is never solved through the course of the film. This was the big plot. How to start the movie STARTED! How do you not break it up? <br /> <br /> I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one ...
