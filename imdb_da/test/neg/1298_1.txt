This may be the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave it a star simply because it is the lowest score possible. Whoever thought Flood would ever be a good movie? The director and the cast were ashamed, and then it began to me that this could all be part of a shambolic scare tactic. Only propaganda can be so bad. <br /> <br /> The redeeming feature of Flood is that it's ghastliness and shameless formula history makes it fun. If only the signs had the same depth as created by the flood itself, they still gallop from sound bite to sound bites without any emotional response at all. The sad thing about this movie is that it could have been so much better, informative, imaginative and tense. Flood has found the amateur strip in many recent British films, where a more focused use of funds would have made for better entertainment. Where was Smithee?
