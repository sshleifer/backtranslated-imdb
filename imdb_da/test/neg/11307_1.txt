Horrible Horrible movie, I still can't believe my friend talked me about seeing this! No plot, bad acting, unfunny scenes and very very stupid dialogue. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst movie I've seen, and it's worse than Halloween III, which I also gave 0 stars. So I give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well here a 1, but you get points.
