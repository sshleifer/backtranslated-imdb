I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he is the most delicious original comedian who comes in times. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines that run the topic of topics from how much Bush sucks to the dizziness that 1970's Robert Evans has done. I am a long-standing fan of Maria Bamford and her broad eyes innocent / schizophrenic routine. When she effortlessly changes her naturally tall voice to someone who is cut and necked, I can't help but giggle. I liked Brian Posehn long before I even knew he was "Just Shoot Me" and there is something so indifferent about his aging nerd persona. All three of these talented, unique comedians "The Comedians of Comedy", a Netflix documentary about their American tour. They really deserve to be stars, and this trip gave them the recognition they really deserve. I thought no, I knew I liked this movie ... But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics, each of which gets their own routine segments, "Comedians of Comedy", they are put down by decaying and boring documentary scenes that do not contain humor, no insight, nothing of real interest. In total, I think there are 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines in a total of 109 minutes of movies. What a rip-off! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars crazy in their RV? Where is humor in seeing Posehn in an arcade and a comic book store? Find any random diner scenes especially fun? If this movie couldn't have shown our comics strutting their stuff, at least do it about what life is like on the road. It's not even about it. Worst of all, the series never seem to be really fun. Oswalt admits how boring he has a radio interview, Posehn admits as much as he sucks by giving a tour of his home, and Bamford improvises nervously whenever the camera points to her, and her humor is only sporadic. /> Sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, incredibly crafted humor that is a refreshing change in the pace of mindless entertainment of mainstream comics such as Dane Cook. Instead, we have to sit through their everyday routines on the road in a subordinate drilling of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film. If you can find any of Oswalt's, Posehn's or Bamford's DVDs, do it in every way. Their talent should be a joy to see, not a task as it is here.
