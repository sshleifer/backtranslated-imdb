This was such a horrible movie, almost a comedy sketch of a noir movie. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still higher than most. But where they have decided to reduce costs that are quite weird. Some players are at least competent, while others seem to have just been pulled out of the street. One of them is the lead star, he is so very bad that I cringed when he ever said anything (he speaks through the ENTIRE movie). Then there are the weird costume choices. In the beginning of the film, all figures carry 1930 clothes. They run a classic car, but the background is a modern windmill that is blatantly state-of-the-art. And costumes and some options continue to follow this 30's movie noir theme. Then BAM runs in a brand new escalator with 24 inch rims .... WTF.Together again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle, you get a shot down the sight. She is aiming for a guy with an mp5 and tactical gear. In an even stranger contrast, the location is brilliant and seems that h ave costs more than the rest of the whole movie. The camera shot / angled very well and shows these places brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a huge eye for a good looking single shot, but no idea how to do much else. <br /> <br /> People who play this movie nails on chalk board voice. <br /> <br /> Anton Pardoe - starring, author, producer If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I wish it would happen to this guy, but he doesn't escape.
