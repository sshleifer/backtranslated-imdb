This movie is really really bad, it's not very well done and is a lack of gloss on anything, but I'm not sure what. I saw it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but did not deliver at all. The characters are superficial and wood, and the music, if you can call it that, is horrible. There are, of course, all creatures and animated creatures, but they are so poorly finished that it does not come across anything other than a third-rate movie. It is a real shame that more attention could not have been used for the special effects, not the whole thing and ending a whole movie I agree with, but in a movie based around them, it is a very important factor. For me, a very boring experiment and should be avoided.
