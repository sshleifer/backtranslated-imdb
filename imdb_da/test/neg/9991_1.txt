It is rare to watch movies that turn out in every aspect, but "Caligula" must surely hold this title. I'm not sure what is more terrible; violence, sexual perversion, play or plot (or serious lack thereof). The two and a half hours follow the basic ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" to the throne of 37AD and show the atrocities and perverseness he allegedly committed in power. The action is lifeless and boring - but it is just the tip of the iceberg. Of course, knowing that this movie was very lacking in anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to set as much nudity and orgy scenes as it was possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't make it easier or focus away from the hideous of this movie. The camera's work is lukewarm, dialogue is ridiculous, in fact you must congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) to hold a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there is the violence. <br /> <br /> If you are watching the movie be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing), but through vile acts that do not have a small point or purpose than to reject the viewer. This is only objective this film achieved. One has to wonder how decision makers in this movie believed that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it delays after two and a half hours, you do not take anything from this movie beyond some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have experienced the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> You have been warned
