An Asian winger assaulted in victims of Niagara Falls and New York City before being driven over by a car. Sheila Morris (formerly Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious "Southern Belle" dub to show that she is from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets to examine. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman ie American porn star R. Bolla) $ 80,000 to help find her sister. After almost no jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally find Diana, who is under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical guru-style things like passing LSD, initiated suicide, and threatens to kill anyone who doesn't comply with him and rapes Agren with a huge dong dipped in copper blood. Each time for a while, a sign looks right or left and sees a gory scene lifted directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both were also directed by Lenzi). I'm sure they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST as well. Here we get the expected animal stroke scenes (gutting a street, native eating live snakes), plus a little extra nudity and castration. Me Me Lai shows off to give her breast implants another workout that plays widowed, the band knocked off three of her brother's laws on top of the ashes of his freaky man. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a professor and does not get much to do. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! You get virtually a promise met with all nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you are a sleaze dog, then see it all. Personally, I was sad about halfway through and just wanted to end it. The original (heavily cut) American edition in 1985 is called THE EMERALD JUNGLE to fool people into believing they actually rented John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. It was also called DOMED TO DIE and EATEN LIVED BY CANNIBALS!
