If you were wondering if Disney could send a show of a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more weapons than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE Girls Next Door, no more wonder. The great thing is that Selena Gomez seems to be the heroine. She must also be excluded from the spoiled, shallow, narcissistic "popular" girls at school, which is no more credible here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from reused BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to "parody" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between being a magic genius and unable to master the complexity of his own laces. The younger boy is just one of the wise mouth "wisecracking" brats who have been watching TV as cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). Dad is the stereotypical stupid TV father, and his mother ... Now she's not really horrible. But everyone blurs beside the hideous, noisy and yet terribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) a play by Mrs Lopez's alley, self-satisfied, snug performance. And again, she is HERINEN.
