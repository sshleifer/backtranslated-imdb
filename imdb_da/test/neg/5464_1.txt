Well, it certainly stunned me - I can't believe anyone made another Australian movie that is even more boring than Somersault. The story is incredible, the characters, with the exception of Friels' and Mailman's characters, are odd and wood, Tom Long possesses a great variety of facial expressions: happy and not happy and "sex scenes" that could have been very confrontational and disruptive erotic would have been at home in a low budget pin pin. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen for 30 years with a movie theater that has had me on the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.
