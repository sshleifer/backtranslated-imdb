After a humiliating experience on a plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sucks the airline and spends the money he wins to start his own full-service airline. What is different is that it has sexy flies, an on-board dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy unless it's just fun fun. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of the Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane doesn't even get close to getting the plane's grin. The insults in Soul Pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. I would lie if I said I didn't laugh as there were some fun moments. However, I expect more and I left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was just a rehash of the first movie, while the former is just a rehash of obsolete, raw jokes. There is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. But I don't think Soul Plane is "bottom 100" bad. Right now the movie is ranked at number 82, and it's a bit hard. I'm not saying it's a good movie, but it's not terrible either. Driving time is only 86 minutes long, so it's not too much of a pain to see. For stupid comedies you can do much worse. No one in the cast is very good, but they all seem to have fun and it helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had some fun lines, but he is a very poor leader. Snoop Dogg, who was mild fun in Starsky and Hutch, flunks completely here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerable and it was the movie's biggest surprise. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not fun at all and he will never be fun. The funniest cast members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they made me laugh most. Eventually, Soul Plane can fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy, but it would be better if you just skip the movie. Rating 4/10
