I don't even know where to start. I didn't like it. It did not invent as a story and so much was injected into the movie (pot brownies, the son was gay (?) The murder was justified, the possible cause could be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) it was never explained. It was all liquid spilled on a table and left to drip off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor. Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five-second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her balls over Broadway character without camp fun? Why was Jane Birkin in the beginning to begin with. The list is endless. The movie ended and we all looked at each other - like - did you understand any of this? <br /> <br /> I tell you one thing if I saw my long lost father being murdered, I would certainly not hug my killer. Tell you another thing if "Bob" broke up with "Bob" which purpose hid his son in the closet? Was Bob having sex with Bob in front of his son? How has the killer contacted his son so easily? <br /> <br /> If this review sounds confused, it is because it was a waste of film, talent and time. What has knocked, the dead shrink has to do with something !! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen because it should have / could have been better, stronger and it should have made some sense. Any sense. Instead, we get an emigrated "Diva" (movie from the 70's complete with a murder) and tired performances that read boring words from a script that is totally crazy. <br /> <br /> By passing it on to the people. Or maybe I and the rest of the people who have gone through this movie are too stupid to understand everything - I mean, it's a French movie.
