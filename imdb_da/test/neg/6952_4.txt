Not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trash / cool genre is great. Unfortunately, this movie shutter of originality and the performances does not reach the trash. See the creator's intention to make it cool, it failed. Waste film is paper trash film because it happens. You cannot create this kind of movie for that purpose. I do not know if Mr Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name) BUT if he is I wonder why the reason ... Horrible. Even the lesbian scenes are pathetic, so all fans of erotic x-ploitation movies are not satisfied, as there are thousands of movies better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
