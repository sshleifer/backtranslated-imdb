This film is about a mysterious love letter that made 4 people's love lives upside down. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is interesting and the movie could have been fun. But this movie is simply what a romantic comedy shouldn't be. The signs are insufficiently introduced first so that it becomes so confusing. The supporting characters come and go without sufficient reasons as if they exist only for a particular scene and then disappear into thin air. Pacing is terribly slow, so it does 90 minutes more than 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and fun, but neither did this movie.
