Mickey Rourke chases Diane Lane in Elmore Leonards Killshot It's not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. He has had a steady style of appearances before he jumps back on stage. He was memorable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on fire, once in Mexico, and getting Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008) we see a full blown presentation of the character, which is only stated in Get Carter. When we get to know him, Rourke remains a cool but clever, muscular slim ball. <br /> <br /> This is an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such remarkable films as Aunt Western Thriller 3:10 to Yuma, Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. That means we get tough guys, some good, some not so good. It also means that we get tight, realistic plot with signs that do the best for them in every situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough, slender ball killer Rourke stalks unhappy married witness Lane. Think about the history of violence not meeting any country for old men. It's not as intense, bloody or gory as the two, but it's almost as good. If you like these two, including David Croneberg's just wonderful eastern promises, you also like Killshot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden hasn't made a lot of movies. His last couple were fun if they failed: Evidence, Captain Corelli Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. <br /> <br /> Diana Lane has not had a strong movie role when she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in unfaithful. Lately, she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as. Night in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs, and Under The Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on the mark and balances her sexual appeal with reserved excitement. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. But Dawson does a good job with it. You see much more of Lane, including an underwear scene for rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. While in the crime drama section, you also need to download Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang and Gone Baby Gone, and before the devil knows your dead. The latter has fantastic performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. It is definitely worth renting 3-4 dollars if you like this genre. 06/20/2009
