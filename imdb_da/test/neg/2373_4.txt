Danny De Vito shows us here, he is definite, infinite, a better on-screen performer than off. He plays that part of Owen, a miserable, writer with a stingy old mother (pleasantly played by Anne Ramsey) he wants to see death. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated scribe who has a foreign wife he feels the same way. So, after seeing Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train", Owen suggests that they switch murders. <br /> <br /> As a director, De Vito's control is inconsistent as he releases this clever idea while his film lurches from the very humorous to the very bland. He and Crystal are all in the lead, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as the cantankerous Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
