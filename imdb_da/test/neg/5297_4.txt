Despite John Travert's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role in his career, "Be Cool" turns out to be a disappointing sequel to 1995's witty and clever "Get Shorty." <br /> <br /> Travolta delivers a comfortable enough performance in this mildly entertaining movie, but ultimately the movie becomes flat due to an underdeveloped plot, odd characters and a surprising lack of chemistry between the leaders Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there is a little laugh, this scary example (which often appeared in the trailers) is a bit of the whole thing: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The movie suggests that everyone in the entertainment industry is a gangster or strives to be one that resembles that of organized crime. In "Get Shorty" is a gangster's "prerequisite basis" by getting into movies a smart fish out of the water idea, but in "Be cool" it seems that biz has gone completely wrong since then. /> <br /> The film is interesting cast and the absolute highlight is a "monolgue" provided by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a goon, where he resumes a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst from "Come with the." Vince Vaughan's character seems to be black and he is often seen dressed as a pimp - it was quite fun in the first scene that introduces him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Be Cold" may be worth renting for John Travolta die-hards (of which I am one), but you may want to keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through it without feeling you wasted too much time. In fact, fans of "Get Shorty" may want to avoid this, as the successor is devoid of most things that made one one a winner. I judge this movie a admittedly tough 4/10.
