When I think of Gift for Fairies, I realize I may not be fair with the movie. My 3/10 rating may have more to do with my disappointment over the movie than the actual quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot description, reviews on the IMDb and 7.6 IMDb rating, I would make sure I had stumbled upon a little known gem. Unfortunately, it just didn't do much for me. For some reason, married to fairies anything but put me to bed. <br /> <br /> Gift for Fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965 Mexico City. One of the girls Veronica is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so credible that she believes and is afraid of everything her friend tells her. It's really about it. In fact, not much is happening and the film draws again and again when Veronica tries to terrorize and dominate Flavia. A commentator on IMDb described it as "the scariest movie in the 80's Mexican cinema". My comment ?? If so, there should not be many horror films made in Mexico in the 80s. Another commentary wrote: "Look at it if you want to be scared." My comment ?? Are you sure we are talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples I have given. For me, it was boring, uninspired and badly acted. The scene collection is particularly annoying as director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of any of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia carry out long, drawn-out conversations with members of their families and their teacher, but we never actually see the faces of those people. It's an annoying gimmick.
