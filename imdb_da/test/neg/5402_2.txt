A lot of the people who have seen this are confused, of course. The original title "Cottonmouth Joe" would have put things in a better perspective for many of the audiences. I have personally experienced the state of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend leg) and it is actually much like the movie Skeleton Man - a dry, scummy movie that provokes regret for recent elections and begging for a hot shower. It is unfortunate that the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title was completed by the distributor (probably working on some counterfeiting of Hollywood, no studio exec who just didn't get it) and not "Cottonmouth Joe." Those of us who have seen the movie know that Skeleton Man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeleton-manic perception, not a true Skeleton Man). The amount of people's marketing this movie is unforgivable, and alone I can't give this movie a high rating. Imagine this: When future filmmakers meet to create the true final Skeleton Man movie and need a title, they are completely screwed up and we are all serious fans of the genre diminished for it. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe could have become a horror movie icon right up here with Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, "Nature Boy" Billy Conners, Morty Tree Doll, Boogen, Eegah, The Moon Beast, Bloody Bill, The Driller Killer, Mickey Rooney and so on, but he will always be remembered as a sword-covering cape-tackle dummy skull face-bound to a horse skeleton man wannabe. It's too bad.
