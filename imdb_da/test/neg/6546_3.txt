This movie has some good ideas that go for it - and that's all that goes for it. The wires, especially Pauley Perrette, are appealing. (Although some of the bit players seem to work from a teleprompter.) The material - that's the problem. I feel as if the scriptwriter / instructor saw the whole of Felicity's run in a meeting, then sat down to write a script without getting any sleep. It really reminded me of Felicity - a thought-provoking young woman who found herself, found love, with a shake-up-and-see-what approach to the characters and their relationships. Apart from that, while I usually see Felicity, this movie left me cold. Scripture is just awful. It is amazing that the cast could come out as well as they did, as the dialogue is boring at best. In the worst case, it becomes thin, stalked and amateurish. There is nothing original here, with plate elements reused from gimmicks that were not so brilliant at first. (Angels and fortune counters? Come on.) In the first half of the movie, I have the clutter of the actors and hope to be rewarded for my patience. In the second half I just wanted it to end already. My sympathies with the cast, which deserved a better vehicle for their talents.
