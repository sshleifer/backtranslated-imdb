The great war breaks out and Dad is a brave pilot who goes out to do some scary work to put Jerry in his place. The mummy makes her a little like a nurse, so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country, where a secret passage takes them to a mischievous sandfe and the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written the best part of a century ago, they no longer make stories about it. And there's a reason. The men fly airplanes and author books; the women change dressings and clean houses. The boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime furloughs; the girls do what they are told and play the violin - bad. Obese children who carry specs are ugly. All the children speak in the clipped, vocal fluttering accents that are mushroomed and primed, but as a particular economic class of English people cultivate. At the top of the snobbery and yearning for Imperial Albion, there are plot holes, a five-year-old would not tolerate. I mean it literally - my son asked why the father disappeared before sunset, so the compass didn't just fall off his hand when he disappeared. The film tries at least to strive strictly for the kids until a completely inappropriate and scary monologue by Eddie Izzard (what a waste of real cartoon) plays over the final credits. <br /> <br /> No doubt the five percent of British schoolmates going to expensive public schools in the UK will find it all such a smooth whim. For the other 95 percent of British families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are all out on DVD.
