Where to start with 'Speck' the true story of Richard Speck, a murderer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on a couple of the extremely low Budget Full Moon Releasing movies (eg Birth Rite), and here it works from a script of (then) Full Moon regular Don Adams. Unfortunately, while the movie seems like an accurate portrayal of the horrible crime, the script is not amazing, perhaps because the real Speck's ramblings were not very interesting! In spite of the care taken to make this authentic, it spreads a cheap deposit of the acclaimed serial serial killer movies from the same period (eg 'Ed Gein'). Filmed in a dirty brown, not quite sepia, mostly and told by star Doug Cole, the film fails to present the offense of the crime because the narrative is annoying, the color distracting from the story and the crime, even though it is cruel and disturbing to see , just that, and there seems to be no editorial work on what is basically a very poor quality camcorder display on the events. There is no investigation into the motivation or Speck's life really, just a cheap shot at a cruel crime. Published by Full Moon, there are few signs of Full Moon's better production here, Charles Band ignores his own rule that his film has fantasy killings (eg, dolls, monsters, etc.) and not quite know what to do with this new reality. In addition, Band introduced a special label for these films called 'Shadow Entertainment'. Band has said he regrets the period of full moon exits along with Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly about Charles Band). The Tempe era has a uniform Apple Mac editing and brutal handheld movie, much like a home video. Speck preserves these qualities and while Witchouse 3 has managed to use these well, for example, Speck is just boring and rough.
