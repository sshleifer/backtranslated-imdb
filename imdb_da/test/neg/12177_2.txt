If this movie would have been in English, all critics would have wasted it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are terribly correct and it is not fun at all. After the movie, I thought that this movie could be written by an 8th degree, at least if you are considering the lack of credible signs and fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, too, on dogs ...) The story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature wings of glass that premiere at the same time. Of course, the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while wings of glass got some attention. <br /> <br /> What really disrupted me was that the movie looked really bad. It was probably because first-time director Josef Fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play with it, for fun I assume. The result, however, is a movie that can easily be divided into 12 short films with a new director style in each of them. This was very frustrating. Perhaps Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films, as it seems to be the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another worrying fact is that history does not coincide. On several occasions in the middle of the film, the story must continue very quickly, and the characters then run into each other in a way that is just too incredible. <br /> <br /> And I haven't mentioned the 2-dimensional characters, especially those in the supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Although I consider this one of the worst Swedish films from the 90s and one of the most overrated, it is a little understandable that the public liked it. I mean, bad taste has always been the mass label ... <br /> <br /> I am more surprised that the critics enjoyed it. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
