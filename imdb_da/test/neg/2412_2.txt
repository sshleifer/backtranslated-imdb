The only good thing about this movie is the artwork on the promotional poster by H. R. Geiger. Anti-nuke protesters, who all looked like punk rockers from the late 1970s and somehow became non-violent (except for their leader, "Splatter") occupy the cities. Fraternity boys go down to the punk to do some violence on them and make them victims. Bad play and bad plot then down on the real victim, you, the seer. I gave this a "2" because a few sexual scenes at least give it the MST3K potential. <br /> <br />
