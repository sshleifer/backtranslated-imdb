How can you go wrong with a movie that mixes sophisticated Peter Cushing, the determination of Donald Pleasence and the bust of Luan Peters? Easy, you give them a terrible script to work with. <br /> <br /> In a vicious role, Peter Cushing leads a satanic cult who has captured a few friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a certain but secluded priest who wants to find his friends, but needs Fred from Scooby-Doo to find them. He calls for help from a New York blood dog who dress like the hero of the cartoon in his mission. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing people, Luan Peters, goes along with the search. If all this sounds interesting, you were like me wanted. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long for the trio to cheat the evil ones, but their methods of bringing the evil to justice are foolish. Also women will find this a crapfest. Each time they go on the evil track, our two male heroes tell Luan to stay at the hotel, even though she can do better than the squeamish priest played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Scripture really lets us down No excitement is built No valuable dialogue is given to the stars and you have to use both hands to count the number of times. Luan Peters is told to stay behind and Let men work men, if you are interested in watching a minotaur on movies do not bother, we get a statue of a minotaur spitting flames). <br /> <br /> VALUE: $$ (There are some attacks and a few victims, but those of you throwing gore will be shut down). <br /> <br /> ACTIVITIES: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite actors in this movie, there is nothing redeemable here. Peter Cushing doesn't have much screen time, Donald Pleasence is clearly aware that he's on a stink and Luan Peters is badly used, it should have been much better considering the talent involved, but then again, Ya nkees loses a game here and there too). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath but you see almost nothing. She's not as obliging here as she was in The Flesh and Blood Show).
