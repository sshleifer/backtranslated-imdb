If you liked the Grinch movie ... you have to see it again, because it wasn't so close to a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying sign to "grace" the screen in recent times. His voice / accent is terrible, and he laughs at his own jokes with a horrifying sound of sound that is about the only laugh I heard in the theater. Not even the kids liked this one people and kids are laughing at something now. Save your money and watch Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday movie.
