A group of friends receive words from a friend who has found gold in an old think tank near an old abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings from the local sheriff, Murphy (John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard (Richard Lynch) a cheated hick that fights tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters and cooked superstitious Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay out of the mine because of it's infamous legend (.. that an evil coalminer who sold his soul to the devil and murdered a priest's (Jeff Conaway) daughter comes back from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these People see only the green, not the blood red, which could potentially ooze from their killed bodies. To find the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that seem to be ahead. But when you don't take warnings from those you consider backwoods, the obvious result will be cruel death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is just a skeleton near an altar containing juxtaposed skulls, while the lights on top of them shine, the humpback waits for the master and dust particles turn him back to a grotesque body with demonic exhibition, his eyes excited with anger. This rude group, hoping for some fun around the campfire of gold, giving them warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the avid ghoul and his medieval pickax. Another victim will meet the crooked end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her car and steer the path straight into the neck. Another unsuccessful attempt to retreat, Stone has caused a frightened victim to drive his car in a tree, his body flaming, as he does not escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, is worried about their well-being, the pickax is buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those who are still alive about the forty-ninjas and the curse of those who raid his eternal stash .. and pay the price for connecting such information. Will anyone survive? Or is the whole group stunned to perish in the hands of the Zombi mine? <br /> <br /> Make-up effects artist and monster create, John Carl Buechler leads this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong storytelling choosing instead to allow his zombie mineral to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his way. He gives just enough back story, and at best it is weak, because the killer allows special guest star, Karen Black (oh, how her career has sunk into the abyss) to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner who holds a priest's daughter-in-law, and threatens to do her, as the Suttersville authorities warn against such action. Brilliant enough, Seedlings that fall right into the back with the opposition relieve their weapons with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. When he retires to his domain, Stone Stone beam sends a warning to everyone, even trying to take what is his, loot. Typically, most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty somethings are your sea ottoman victims, with little development except for some scratches and word exchanges as a filler until the dead man enters the scene to be slaughtered. They are the usual group, from the city, violating to unknown territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, much of the violence is off-screen. What is on the screen, the minimal gore, is fairly presented and proceeds quite quickly. Ghoul make-up for the killer is only occasionally shown; He is mostly encased in the dark, the victim's horrified faces, when he catches or chases them, gets more credibility than the method of destruction. One thing is for sure, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times a sign is burned by either a lantern or a flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a smaller cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and dense honey. Vernon Wells (.. of Road Warrior and Commando Fame) has Jeremiah Stone's story as a person still playing the same form of threat he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to enjoy himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, they welcome outsiders to his neck of the forest. Buechler has a pretty attractive play by actresses, all wearing tight pants and small jerseys, and showing their sleek and athletic characters, especially Elina Madison as a lying Roxann, who is always willing to remove her clothes for greedy shakes, Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather lumpy foil used as a bunch of many jokes, including his "dump in the woods" scene and current vacancy.
