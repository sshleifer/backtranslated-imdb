I just happened to stumble upon this movie and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6.7, yes ... not so bad. Genre: scifi ... well i like scifi. So I got the movie, and I was looking forward to having a relaxing Sunday night watch it. But but ... NO. As in summary, there is no movie at all. It's a religious ad, including: Preatching about Jesus, God, the Devil, the End of the World, etc. Movies start with an epic abduction story: Night driving, car stop, light, and so on ... Now it was actually the movie. Last of this ... um ... honestly I don't know what to call it ... was dialogue about the end of the world and the last judgment. The very same thing these TV preachers tell you, but they are "good" for it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you want to watch a scifi movie or something with UFOs, stay away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear something the cuckoo head's mind what the Bible has to say and what to do. So go ahead and see this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> This is a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda that other users said = Well ... I should have red commented another user's comments before I got the movie. (27% of voters rated this "thing" as 10. Yes, right. Please. go somewhere else to do your propaganda)
