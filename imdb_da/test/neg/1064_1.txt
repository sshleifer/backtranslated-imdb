There is nothing original, human or insight into this movie. The action is average, the pictures are amateurish, the writing lacks ease and the scenes are very basic ... something close to a soap. In 2:37, a suicide is used to turn the film into a tension drama. We look partly because we want to know who is dying. The different characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is to them, but only as a way to get them to a place where you think they might kill themselves. Despite the various views the camera offers on the most important events, there is NEVER another way to see the events themselves. So in 2:37 the assholes are assholes, the angels are angels. These are simple things. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence. You hardly learn the children as much as the breasts, bodies and limps, as the filmmaker passes as characterization. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you know anything about movies in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature rip off of elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. But while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive positions on IMDb strangely avoid something about this or simply do not appreciate originality. If you want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation. I was surprised by the age of the filmmakers when I found out after watching this movie - I had assumed that a 13-year-old had made it. The Twenty Somethings I have always known are too busy trying to express something right in them to lift an old man's work.
