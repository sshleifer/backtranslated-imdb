I really wanted to like this movie. A movie with zombie children coming out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a good idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film in the bottom 3 of movies played on horror party. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters are trying to move on after her husband / father has gone from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They must adapt to their new environment. They end up fighting because of all the surroundings for various reasons. (Crazy Zombie kids go into this category) The movie never gives any sentimental attachment to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not scare or jumps worthy moments, the film hardly shows the kids doing what to do ... kill! With a bigger budget and a better cast, this film can have hope. Until then, send it on. <br /> <br /> In fact.
