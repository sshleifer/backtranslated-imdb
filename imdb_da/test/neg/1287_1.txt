This is a really bad waste of your time. I'd rather see some documentaries than this; It's really that bad. The play is really awful and you can say that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality. It is far on the low end of the scale; Don't waste your money on it. <br /> <br /> I have a really hard time believing in the person who made this movie that it would go well. I had to see it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids. Even the kids (3, 4, 6 and 8) all thought it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other commenting that Spongebob would be much better to see than this. <br /> <br /> All in all: Don't just see it. Do not do. Do not do.
