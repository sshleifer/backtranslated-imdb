When I flew through the canal, I came to a channel 124. It is a city canal. I watched this movie and decided to try. I was almost mass murderer because of this movie. I made home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge lot of Dookie. The lighting was awful and the actor was absolutely unbelievable. I'd rather see Star Crystal ....... Holy cow maybe it's not a good example. The most important question I have about this movie is ... Was it a moral movie? The reason I ask is because there was a line where this lady in a wheelchair says "I would have been another gang statistics" Oh my head is beginning to hurt. After hearing that line, I went into the kitchen and pulled a knife ready to throw someone who dared to watch this movie. But some sensation kicked in, and I just changed the channel to see the man with afro paint. That's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, continue but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes
