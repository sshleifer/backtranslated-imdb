The only reason I myself give this movie a 4 is because it was made into an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. The dreadful direction is slightly overshadowed by the characters' complete inability to act. The management is an actor, I have never seen anything else, and it shows. No chemistry with the interest of love and so bland, you almost don't care what happens to him. Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was supposed to be super evil ... he was more annoying than anything. Peter Graves was the only person the movie was not horrible, his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent. In 2004, someone tried to make this mess again, it was called The Island ... I personally didn't watch the movie, but from what I understand the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie, the MST3k episode gets its really fun ... full of enchanted and biographical references that make this movie finally visible
