Thought I could just grab a few laughs from this long drawn-out movie, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This movie is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passed grade without trying to open a book or do something. The film also portrayed teachers and principal, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), "Labor Pains", 2000 as complete idiots. I know this was supposed to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh, and I thought the whole movie was a complete waste! However, all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining movie! Just studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!
