There are really no redeeming factors about this show. To put it simply, it's just awful. Absolutely terrible. It's just a horrible "reality" show. It's not just that, it's terrible fiction. Imagine this: A bunch of fanciful teens meet one night and go "Hi! Let's make a paranormal show like" Ghost Hunters "and whatnot!" So they grab a camera, harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painful "trying to be dramatic, yet unsuccessful" monologue. This show is basically a bunch of teens running around with a home camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and authors. A wasted budget and horrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the problems, how do I count you? Well, first of all, let's talk about this from a personal level. I'm not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. I am willing to believe what is paranormal and what not and I am sure there are many people who feel the same. So if you are going to make a paranormal show, do a good job convincing the viewer that what they see is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. I hate to compare, but I can't see why not at this time. Take "Ghost Hunters" for example. In "Ghost Hunters" you can see that the cast is leveled with the audience. They are not entirely skeptical, but they are still willing to keep in mind the possibility of any paranormal anomalies. They should look at something and be willing to say "it's possible, it's simply nothing". And with that in mind, they set out to try to prove themselves wrong. They use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal in bearing the fact that what they can monitor could not be in mind. Not only do they try to convince themselves what is genuine and what is not trying to convince you. The element of doubt is not present in "paranormal state". Strike one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State" the casting simply says "there is this scary place and it is HAUNTED, so we have to find some SPIRITS!" And immediately you know and say to yourself "Okay, convince me otherwise". The cast is not professional in their interviews. In fact, it sometimes seems like they only harass local residents in these so-called "haunted" areas. They have no real evidence to back up their claims beyond assumptions and theories, and the best they can be must be someone who "claims" they can contact the dead without anyone ever supporting who that person is. and how valid they really are. They could have easily picked some random people out of the street and said "pretend you can contact the drinks for our show" and went on it. In the "Mothman" section, it just happens. Without convincing evidence towards the end of the show, they bring out this kind of individual, making a random, painfully "read" of an assumed area of ​​how something is "haunted" to convince his audience. Very, very poor effort. I feel that one of the biggest problems with the show is that it feels written. During one of the episodes, the attack is attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" at times in an attempt to be dramatic. These kinds of dramatic sequences would make something skeptical laugh, and even those on the fence realize what they see is just a bunch of tabloid-esquire trash. If the show's goal was to try to convince their audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they are doing a terrible job doing so. Turn two. <br /> <br /> But there is always the counter. Just a last point of view to see if the show is actually worth anything. What if the show doesn't try to convince you that these paranormal events are genuine and simply try to entertain you with good fiction? It even fails at that level. If the creators of the show were trying to make fiction to entertain their audience, writing too poor and even fictitious, fails to convince the public that its well-known members are truly experiencing the unknown in all its full, terrible honor. Scripture is simply not convincing and even dare I say boring. Strike three. So what's left of this show is simply a bunch of teens who are too willing or too happy to believe in the paranormal simply because it is simply far more amazing than reality that sets itself off with a camera, a bad script and bad actors generally just make a really bad horror documentary. It's the whole show at this time. There is no need to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no need to worry about it. To be blunt is its lame. There are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show.
