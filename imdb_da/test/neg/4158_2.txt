There is nothing worse than science fiction designed by people who don't have a feel for it. Grab a concept that would not be so terrible by itself (a future where cloning is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you genetically) suitable imagination to run wild. When Tim Robbins' characters were able to guess a security guard computer password just by telling her one thing about himself, I knew I was in trouble. This ability was later revealed that due to Robbins having taken an "empathy virus", viruses are used to provide immediate (or almost immediate) skill upgrades to their users. Robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus - a Mandarin Chinese language virus that allowed her to speak Chinese, but when she complained, "she couldn't understand what she was saying." Okay, first time, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without incorporating some sort of true mind-reading aspect (like an empathy virus that actively releases virions nearby, infects nearby people, fetches bits of their memory, then they go to the original host - which is what you can probably say, a smidgeon on the impractical side) you cannot justify being able to determine a particular detail as a person's password just by "listening to the things you did not say". You also cannot acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you say - the virus cannot infect your voice cables and translate to you on the run because a virus cannot * think *. To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a learning virus would change your brain. It has to be coded for knowledge among neurons, and when it is in, it's * your * - you probably understand what you're saying because you need to. To use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand the task (mostly). Unless, of course, they indicate that the virus is deliberately designed to introduce some bizarre mental skeletons with multiple personalities, some of your sub-subjects act as a built-in one-way translator. <br /> <br /> The amount of language spoken by the characters is decent enough, though nowhere near remarkable enough to justify all the love that other reviewers have given. In addition, all the multicultural introductions in the world cannot make up for a simple and frustrating fact: the dialogue stinks! It's slow, it's plodding, and it's unnatural. Again, I am confident that followers have convinced themselves that the boring alien is simply the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic (and therefore subject to linguistic operation) form of speech. I disagree. Good dialogue is a good dialogue at all times - and the same goes for tripe. Finally, I want to see the film's central concept - the ban on sex with yourself. Widespread cloning is a beautiful, classic sci-fi item. Thus, global warming leads to ecological destruction (which code 46 also incorporates). Unfortunately, the two do not go together! If you have an ecological disaster that cuts hard on the available living space, you don't run around cloning people! You have population problems enough, as it is - you don't add them by switching re-releases. Regular, old-fashioned sex-and-birth gives all the people you need and cloning of any kind would be stubbornly repressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the movie wasn't that bad. It had some good movie pictures. Maybe if I had seen it subdued, I could have had it.
