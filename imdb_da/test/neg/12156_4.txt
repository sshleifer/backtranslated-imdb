The story was clear and concise, but in general the film never hit my interest scenes flat and uninspired. Ghengis Khan historically had a very interesting / epic life, but the film failed to capture it - instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a lot of other movies. I never felt sympathy or empathy for the management - yes, he had to overcome slavery, but then seemed to have an easy walk to khan-pillaging, killing and crossing the way to the top. The one redeeming quality was the photograph - the landscapes certainly helped the movie's grim atmosphere, unfortunately combined with the gloom of history - I left untouched and disappointed ..
