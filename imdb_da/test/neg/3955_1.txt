Except that Frankie Muniz speaks too quickly to understand (Malcolm in Middle flashbacks?) Can this movie still not create a scare. The idea of ​​the "Countess" and the story of her placed in the story was fun, but the plot and many side plows did not coincide. Plot synopsis: Murder ghost lures victims through video games. Toss in some blood spatters and a special effect and you've got yourself another bombed out would be horror flick. The ghosts resemble the ghost of "The Ring Two" too much. The acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is incredible. Save your money.
