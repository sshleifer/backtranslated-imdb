It's hard to imagine two actors of such a class and experience that Michael Caine and Michael Gambon become involved in such an embarrassingly unfortunate movie. Responsibility for this poorly condemned production should be down to the author, Neil Jordan and Director Conor McPherson. I doubt I have seen such a bad movie with such good credits for a long time. The comedian Dylan Moran, who made his mark as the annoying and incompetent bookshop holder in television sitcom, Blackbooks, turns a lot to the same routine here, except with such a surplus and lack of comic control, leaving a squirming. It is easy to see how history could have been made to work, because the situation is interesting and loaded with comic potential. A classic actor (Caine) tries to tear off the mob (Gambon and co) with the help of a bumbling wannabe colleague (Moran) with predictable results. It could have and should have been good. Unfortunately, it was not.
