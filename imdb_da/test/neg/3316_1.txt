This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is not only that, it is a comedy that is not fun, but it is also very poorly made with one over the top direction that is filled with unnecessary split screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying, and it confused me quite a lot that they touched each other's genitals all the time. But the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give the film some appeal by referring to German history and showing sensitive aspects of the "heroes" who find their highlight in showing how Erkan and Stefan heal a mentally ill woman with their "happy" lifestyle (!). But I did not expect anything better from director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also made two non-fun TV shows, a not fun western movie and an almost non-fun SF comedy film. But Erkan and Stefan had been - just a little better in some of their stand-up programs. For me, the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful to me.
