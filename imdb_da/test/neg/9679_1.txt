I've seen some bible-based garbage can. This tops it all. To make matters worse, it lasts approx. three hours. A horrible waste of time unless you want to match your child's biblical knowledge against the myriad deviations. Do yourself a favor - take a trip in the Sahara instead. Since I am obliged to give you a ten line statement on why not to watch this movie, let me just say that there is absolutely no redeemable quality for it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. It all has a stench of "let's have the Biblical account look delayed." The basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film, why not make it worthwhile? Since the basic logic is not met, something is wrong. The movie starts with a disclaimer for poetic licenses taken ... that is the understatement of the century. Poetic rape. But then poetic would be an unnoticed advantage.
