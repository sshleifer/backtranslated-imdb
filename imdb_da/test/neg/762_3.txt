C.H.O.M.P.S. is much like any number of cheesy late 70s Disney family comedys-The Cat from Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball, for example. Outside of anything creative, they killed the same clichés, but vaguely entertaining in a thoughtless way. The actors will not win any awards, nor will the director, the author or the FX crew, but in its unofficial nose and incredible predictability, there is some vague entertainment to have. The idea of ​​the robot dog as a security system is so full of holes that you can use it as a collar. The incredibly repeating disco soundtrack keeps you in the head, so beware.
