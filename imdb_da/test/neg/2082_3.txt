The Greek site for parts of the movie was very beautiful and the photo gets all my voices, and it's about the extent of my raves to this movie. I found out that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in American culture and were low and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to look at, but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party, I was wondering how this woman could think of herself as a competent star on stage. I was tempted to hit the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia's character was so lecherous that he was downright scary. The movie was too long for my taste, and I couldn't put it through again, even in a gun.
