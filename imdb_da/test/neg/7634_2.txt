Man, this is miserable. It does not deserve much in the way of commenting, so Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police officer who falls for Latin lovers Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, ponytail and prison tats. When she cuts loose, she really cuts loose. Apart from this horrible affair she has (and we must admit that the affair has its pace of speed), she is a pretty cold fish. Her broken father rushes out for the first time this year and she supports him. She is also good at keeping her coat on top of neighbor (Dennis Miller) in the bay. And there's prisoner Harry Dean Stanton trying to maneuver her to give him a diagnosis of several personality disorders so he won't get his private nails on the wall for the serial killer he has committed. <br /> <br /> All these people, and perhaps more, immediately suspect when strange things come to her. Someone sends their dead flowers. Someone makes invisible things to her cats. (The next time I see a domestic animal livestock show up in a packet or strapped up in the closet or cooked in a pot, I will puke.) So who does it? Guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the end, but perhaps a tip would help: child abuse. <br /> <br /> The abuse insurance is an interesting business in itself, far more interesting than the film. What does "childhood abuse" mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about whacking a child over the back with a wood cooking done, hard enough to break it? That was what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just as similar things happened to all the other killing boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? It has never happened to any of us, as far as I know, though I am not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village I was studying for two years, there was a case that a teenage girl appeared to play sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family put hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. When he returned, the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (By the way, the little girl we are seeing here under five, so it is unlikely that she will remember Father's night visits in any case, since the long-term memory is not really established until around that time.) DeMornay's experience of her mental illness being called "the social construction of trauma." It's not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric lecture. It will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> You want trauma? I'll give you trauma. The movie absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character right from the start. So when she has her first try together with Antonio Banderas, and Pio Donnagio's score conquers the eroticism in our heads, the camera gets a shot from above her shoulder by the harsh torso Antonio crawling over us with his hard chest. Now it is traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel as though he is on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Don't make me wrong. I don't like Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There are not enough nude pictures of Rebecca DeMornay's elephant throughout the universe to compensate for such anxiety. Here is an engaging way to survive this movie. Instead of just sitting there pulsing, try picking the scenes filmed in Toronto and separating them from them shot in Budapest. It is a challenge, really, and can, for all we know, preserve your beauty.
