Usually when the BBC broadcasts a TV series, one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. Usually, the TV series is excellent, although the story is boring, you can count on the play to make it worth it. When I came over, persuasion, here at the local library, I looked forward to a nice evening because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I read the story first, otherwise I wouldn't think strongly about it. In addition, I was relieved to know that this TV show's production date was from 1971 when I believed until the BBC had lost it. It's really bad, and should be used for acting as scary movies. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought I have about this series is that the people of this movie are unlikely to appear or be involved in any BBC or other product of this century except the sisters of the young music groves who apparently took their Fist steps in acting and did remarkably well under the other direction.
