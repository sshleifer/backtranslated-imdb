As bad as good - not only the script is obvious, but the play is not only poor but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of the characters: unrealistic ingenuity, affected reactions, the camera forces to see superficial aspects introduced as keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> Cannot stop laughing when the end, the protagonist says something else like 'your daughter doesn't play football and doesn't know cooking'. Such an offense to female intelligence defines the level of this film. Is the movie about the second character's psychological behavior, about its influence on the protagonist, or just a series of events set in order to warm up to the obvious end? <br /> <br /> Pls, make more of them - I was happy to guess what next would go wrong ...
