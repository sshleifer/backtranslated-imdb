Almost certainly staged assembly of women reads lines (very short) and becomes naked (not very short) in front of an anonymous (and uncredited) panel - almost certainly including producer Charles Band. The throw-in is random scenes of Surrender Cinema's many films (primarily lesbian scenes). Most women like "riding horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition; a secret; camera as movie actresses gets naked behind the screen ... Jacqueline Lovell (also made but still beautiful) introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and speaks in a 'sexy' way to the camera (If you enjoy lesbian scenes, it is with Lovell and Vanesa Taylor from Femalian included and they are probably the best looking lesbian "couple" ever). Strange excuse for a movie and apart from the obvious drawing of naked women, an honest stupid and uninspiring experience.
