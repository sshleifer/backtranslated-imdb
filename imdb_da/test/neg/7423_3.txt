Lance used to get quality support from James Cameron. Heck, he even had his own TV show (Millenium) for a switching season. Why is he doing this? Couldn't he find a better way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I love a good low budget movie. Some of them you can just laugh because of their ridiculous premises, their textbook stereotypical characters, or often times, because the actors are related to the instructor / producers. But this movie has no redeeming value. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I only had this sick feeling in my stomach. That feeling was quickly identified as shame. At one point, Lance Henriksen was an A-list support actor. He has been in Terminator (he was supposed to be a terminator before Arnold appeared), Aliens, AliensIII, classic B-movie Pumpkinhead, among so many others! I wanted to send him money after this. Maybe we should start a support Lance fund or something. <br /> <br /> Again, to do this ... maybe not.
