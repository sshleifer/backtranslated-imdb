I was told that Jon was for a while on spiritual experiences. I guessed that the movie will be interesting. In fact, it is not at all. Not so much for such a subject. "eternity" endless life. Experience after death and "dejavu". The movie is not like a comedy, but is not at all fun, at least not explicitly yet. It's so naive. Charming movie but naive movie. A must to avoid. The medieval sequences seem to come directly from adventure and it is nothing at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight does his best. Normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie. The film was launched directly on video so I discovered it on a video store. It's a shame, because I know that Voight was seriously involved in spirituality, and the film isn't so much about it.
