I got the movie from the library and so it had many actors I like in it (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I got it and saw it. I expected Cleese to have a big role since he had first billing, I was surprised to find that he had about five minutes of screen time with everyone else I liked. This movie is incredibly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the end is one of the worst conclusions I have ever seen. There were some fun parts, but it's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going "What?" and "Huh?" And if you don't want to waste your time. Ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie ... it's not. Just stay away from it at all costs ... thank you.
