Mind-numbingly boring, totally predictable and ultimately just ridiculous. It sums up the disaster that is innocent proposal. Beginning with a decent premise, whole things simply wander off and become a complete mess. Basically, the story boils down to the question: "Will you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Of course, the answer is yes, because otherwise we would not have a movie. Frankly, we would have been better off if we didn't have a movie. <br /> <br /> Our married (and financially troubled) couples are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yes, it will work. A billionaire, played by Robert Redford, still resembles the wife and makes the million dollar offer. For one night with the wife, he gives them financial security. The aftermath of one night is what the film really is about. Unfortunately, nothing in that demand is at least entertaining. Scripture is so predictable that you can say the lines of the sign before they do it. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off comedies, as this attempt at serious action completely lacks the brand. Anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. And it is certainly to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear space in her home for any Academy Awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that must be full of emotions, she conveys none. Only Redford escapes mostly unharmed. He is suitably slimy but suave and clearly the best actor of the pile. But he can't save this movie. Horrible script, lousy plays, plodding pace, zero entertainment ... Complete suggestion is actually terrible.
