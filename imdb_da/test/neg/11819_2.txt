And you would be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as 'Women in Chains,' is precisely the kind of fragile and crazy b-movie that the premise suggests. Pam Grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with many other women, and this place is seriously camping, where Martha Stewart is unlocked, right now as a maximum security prison. It is not five minutes in the movie that one of the hottie guards broadcasts the 'Strip' line and gets them wet ', and then we are introduced to a prison life that looks like some college freshman's imagination of what the inside of a sorority house is like. <br /> <br /> Catching soap and rubbing and fighting each other in the shower, as if it were a Girls Gone Wild shoot, so they all hang out in their dorm room, openly smoking pot and discussing in a large group what would be the best ways to escape. I have never been to prison myself, but I have the feeling that escape plans are the kind of things that you want as few people as possible to know about, prisoners or guards or otherwise. The biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy-oriented life is that the women in this movie all have orange cardigans (and no pants) who say PRISON at the back. Must be the generic prison garments for prisons that cannot afford expensive accessories such as their prison names or prison numbers for their uniforms. And, as can be expected, a prison that cannot afford to capture Capture identification on the uniforms of the uniforms cannot, of course, expect to find guards interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other. <br /> <br /> The conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends much of the time handcuffing a blonde prisoner named Karen as they flee the police after they have escaped from prison. I will not go into details of how they escape to say that you might have seen something like that in The Fugitive if they could not afford to create a train wreck, and that leads to the confused story of conflicting interests also chasing these two women for various reasons. Karen and Lee both have their own gangs of people, each hoping to save their respective escaped prisoner and the police are after both of them constantly. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) So Karen is involved in a bunch of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen will just get out of the island, something she's been trying to do for years, and it's not just perfect that each of them should go to completely opposite sides of the island to meet their goals. So we get this unequal pair pairing, and since they are a strange couple, it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the movie, but will be happy at the end. <br /> <br /> In a movie with so many conflicting interests, especially when these conflicting interests not only drive the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be climax moment, involving the rival gangs of some points in the movie. Not to leave anyone unhappy, they throw in a stupid team at the end of the movie, where everyone shoots machine guns on each other and kills each other massively, while the two women paddle safely and quietly across the river in a small boat. On a. <br /> <br /> Better yet, at the end of the movie, after a huge massacre where many people are shot and sprayed light red paint everywhere, police captain over the masses of dead criminals is covered by horrible, terrible special effects and we learn that he will be a major before dinner. Not a bad way to finish the movie, the criminals kill everyone and the police get the whole credit, but here's the last line of the movie ?? "It's better to win, isn't it?" <br /> <br /> IS THERE, why the captain is going to be promoted to Major? Because he figured it out ??
