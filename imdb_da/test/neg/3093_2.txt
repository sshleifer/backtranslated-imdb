I was suckered by the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds, and the fact that it was an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two boring songs and a botched rip off. I didn't care about the signs, and the plot never tempted me to pretend it could be realistic. I can't believe that's what makes it the screen. I loved watching this movie because it felt so good when it was over.
