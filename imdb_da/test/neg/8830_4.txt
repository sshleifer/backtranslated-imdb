This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and dichotomoy between the necessary public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been influenced by company leader Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the company. He sends him to England to negotiate an agreement where Taylor is both amazed at the ethics and morals of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he is. He comes back and he has made his duty, but has told the truth to English about his motives. He tries to marry the refugee instead of the boss's niece, and then Ive's attempt to discredit the refugee as an appropriate wife for a business leader. It could have been laughing, nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on romance separates the film from the points it is trying to make about corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> In a way, the costume design was nominated (undeserved) for an Oscar - all business cleats and the two women in the movie dress conservatively - studio policy at work once again, no doubt. What is stiking, however, is the black and white CinemaScope filmography that is excellent - this if something deserved Oscar nom. (It was MGM's first 'Scope movie in B&W'). <br /> <br /> Not as good as it could have been, but not terrible.
