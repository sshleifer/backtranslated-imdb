This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi! <br /> <br /> I have noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and yet, <br /> <br /> ironically we have a protagonist played by Andy Garcia <br /> <br /> who is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy, "The many of the many needs exceed the needs of the few or the one". <br /> <br /> Let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer, he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk. Michael Keaton's character is almost as unrealistic. He fails to kill by many opportunities and yet is angry when Garcia folks his <br /> <br /> attempt to kill a bunch of police at once. The child's doctor remains responsible for her faculties even after being held hostage several times in a short time, but <br /> <br /> puts her on a wide walkway 5 stories and she loses it. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia's children are some of the anathema in this <br /> <br /> movie. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the film's bright spots. He also emits a line that must have been the result of serendipity in combating cancer that is parallel to Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the movie was not a complete waste (see From Foam to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> <br /> for that) but disappointingly considering the talent at hand.
