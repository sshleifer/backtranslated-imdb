Brainless movie about two girls and some guys they meet at an airport, arrives on the wrong night bus and ends in a whole world of trouble. Big twists are quite, and I mean totally wasted in a movie with a plot so incredibly stupid as to believe in the description. What is going on in the general sense is okay, I mean the idea that a guy kidnapping unattended girls for jailed purposes is a good one. The problem is that the details are so incredible that I would be shocked if you didn't turn off the movie in complete disbelief. Gee, a guy who supposes to take you home doesn't go into any of the ways you know and stay on the bus? It gets worse from there, think of any bad choice, and this movie has the signs do it, even to the point where they could just go away but never do. What is annoying is that some of the twists may have worked if there was something intelligent before that, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this movie. Okay, maybe there is the end, the end is clever. The end is the kind of thing that should freak you out. it should be "oh # $ * @ !!!!" moment and become a classic of horror cinema. Instead, it's just among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless films of the year.
