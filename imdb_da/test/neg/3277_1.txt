Although I agree that this was the most horrible movie ever made, I am proud to say that I own a copy simply because me and a lot of friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scene, but also a few others. had the potential of Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon, who was signed, but as one that was most viewed every day, I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused person, at least during the movie. that he could find his way to the set every day, I would also like to think that this could have been a better movie if a lot of it hadn't been destroyed in a fire in Morning Calm Studios. would have been safe, but it would be great to think about it, I was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. to pro wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven n was a breaker in Portland at the time ... lovely guy, very smart.
