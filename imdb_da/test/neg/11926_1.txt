Right up (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and Phantom Menace. The premise sounded cool, some of the advertisements looked semi-promising, but unfortunately the whole movie had approx. 30 seconds of nice shots, and it was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, second rate effects, ridiculous costumes and an all-round snooze test in every way look. The reason is recycled sci-fi foot. Too bad also because I came in, I thought it would be bad, but kept hoping. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Don't look at it. <br /> <br /> Of course, unless you like any of the above 3 movies.
