I loved the first Grudge, I saw it in an empty theater, and in honesty I was freaked out. Never before had I heard the unique sound of chilling sounds, it was really poignant. Grudge 2, however, had a few good jumps, but the story was really nice, and not entirely credible, and everywhere, with a few scenes (like a woman urinating out of fear, or another of a young woman drinking a pitcher of milk and then vomit it all over again), which really didn't make any sense and didn't help improve the film's crawl factor. During these scenes and a few others, people in the sold out audience were actually loud. It was a good indicator to show how this movie lacked the excitement, chills or creeps. The play was decent, the emotions that were portrayed were credible, so hats to the actors, but the rat story and its lack of direction was something I could not shake throughout the movie. I was annoyed more than anything, the same old grudge gagging sounds, a few quick unexpected scenes to make me jump, but overall I was very disappointed.
