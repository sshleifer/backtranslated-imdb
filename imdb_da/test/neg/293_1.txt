As a horrible cancer raining out of the sky, I walked into this crock on some movie channels the other night. Being a fan of bad movies and actively engaging in the buying and displaying of the bad movie, was fascinated by the idea of ​​a truly horrible watching action movie from modern times. After that, I beat my hands inexplicably in the way to me and grabbed something within reach and stuck about head and neck. Something scary was in that band ... er ... where was I ... yet this is among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of movies I've run over. William Forsythe cannot play more than one character, and that sign is always a walking joke. Even when put into a cartoon and given things to do and say it should be fun (ala Deuce Bigalo), he is ridiculous in the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is very much the same, having played in her fair share of terrible movies and doing terrible jobs in all of them, she fails to help scum up this. Classic b-movie villain Andrew Divoff does a respectable job, but hardly has any scenery to chew on. Even reliable standby for b-movie action Daniel Bernhardt fails to deliver anything that borders on entertainment. Regarding the film's own benefits, the plot is lama, the manuscript, as well as the plot and plot movement, is both boring and ... well stupid, because a better adjective is lacking (lord knows they didn't put anyone Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen Some bad ones, and anyone who has seen enough bad can learn how to appreciate them, but there is simply nothing here to enjoy unless you are among the poorest movie tolerants and just feel so inclined to test your mettle. do it, take it from me, this is not even horrible enough to be enjoyed (as opposed to saying ... some of the more ridiculous Italian zombie films). A fan of b-movie action would be much better to check out Most of Bernhardt's other films, or just about anything else that has ever been set to film for that matter, America is simply not the place to go for action, it seems, especially not now.If you have a desire, check out everything from the sea, movies like Heroic Duo or the slightly less common Hakaider (along with everything else in the amazing Keita Amemiya's cannon) will give much more fun and better action than your ability to find elsewhere, especially here.
