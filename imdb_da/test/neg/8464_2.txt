Boring film. Bad plot. Bad actors. The film takes place in a room that was supposed to be in Morocco, but actually in some American cities! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> There is something good about this movie, but that's why the score is 2 out of 10. The director becomes the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the right thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film relates to the Dutchman traveling (15 seconds), while the other part is about staying in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something). The Dutch guy will deliver money in Morocco to some "charities", get out of the plain, take the bus and end up being kidnapped in a dark brown room. He's kidnapped with another guy who's shot after telling "They won't shoot at us". The Dutch survivor has to play chess with a Morpheus-like Arab guy so long that you learn to play chess too! In the end, the Dutch guy reveals his plot, not because they cut off four fingers, but because he is fooled by such a lamb game, you have to watch the movie! Good when you're so tired you can't sleep
