Warner Brothers Corporate Social Responsibility at its most hammered, preaching every five minutes or more about how we are Americans, does not run from problems we face our responsibilities. It also suggests that if you are willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly mobsters, you are un-American. Walter Huston looks bored, is the frustrated DA, and the "average American family" includes as familiar faces as Sally Blane (resembling her sister Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore as a supposedly sweet mop. Both are regularly squeezed out of the Chic Sale frame, only 47 then, but playing an octogenic civil war veteran, frugal jumping, and "entertaining" sipping on the ban and moralizing on how we're Americans, day nabbit. His St. Vitus Dance's old-fashioned performance is tiring schtick; It's like Walter Brennan based his entire career on it. William Wellman directs effectively and quickly, like his former "Public Enemy", but he and the writer neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fade out - that is, they will probably be sparked by the mob.
