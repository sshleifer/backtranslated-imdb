I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar at the big dept store. It is probably the best and best comment I have to offer on it. At least I have not cheated on the cost of lunch. The problem with "Chiller" is Craven's problem as an instructor. The man has his apologies claiming his travel papers, proving that he is a really smart guy and all-round sharp concept man. But it is no secret that he, as a director, has never had a single iota of a Hitchcock's visual and historical sensation. As strongly confirmed by "Chiller", he is much closer to the legendary flat foot Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven lacks as an instructor is the most important ingredient that would lift him from instructor to rental to a higher filmmaking level. <br /> <br /> Let us be specific. The transition moments in this movie are slim. The established shots give it the feeling of a quality production. The film looks professional together, in the way a movie picture from a television commercial director would. (One thought: the films only visual distinction, these transitions that at least look professional, may well be the work of some other unit directors.) It is the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions - the drama - that falls flat. <br /> <br /> The core of the case is always treated perfectly. The critical shots (after saying that the outgoing car enters the well-positioned camera, we cut to an exterior hospital exterior, then to the waiting area and hallway, and then to the telephone booth in the corner that will find out the next action ) is quickly dispensed so we can hurry and get to the next part. Craven never comes anywhere to explode the immediate dramatic or visual possibilities. The net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts and the fumbling hurry to keep things moving is a film that feels like the work of artificial art student cutting all his pencils, adjusting his crowd and brightness, laughing all his pigments, stretch and prime his canvas ... and then have nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never comes to the meat of the tree. <br /> <br /> For Craven apologists who want to point out that this movie was made for television, I would point to Spielberg's "Duel" and say no more.
