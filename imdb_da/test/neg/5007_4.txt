What's wrong with CURACAO (Also known as BAD CURRENTS, although what the reason for the name change is, I have no idea) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover: "Keep it down baby, I'm trying to sleep" < br /> <br /> It's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered, it's the fact that the actress has a central European accent. Nothing wrong with that before it is revealed her character is from Philidelphia in the United States! This what struck me about this thriller while you watched it - The way accents do not match their characters. Apart from the Philly woman with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who sounds like he is an Irishman who publishes a Gestapo officer and worst of all George C Scott plays someone who is either Dutch or British with an accent it sounds like it could be American thin with South African. You quickly find out what is on the screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a sign might be due to the strange way they speak. It is interesting to note that this site has not given this movie a country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel that this was produced by the United Nations <br /> <br /> Although you are not curious about accents or dialects, you probably have to give up the following action anyway because CURACAO is plot less. Things happen like a boat exploding, and a hostage situation and hero are recruited as an agent of South African intelligence, but you are scratching your head and wondering what it is all about.
