If you want to waste a small portion of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. It fails at first post by not being scary or fun. It's a dull gray movie that I guess went straight to the video. Hammy and the tongue in the cheek seem to leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to see a bad but still available, recent zombie movie, see Diary of the Dead. Bad special effects, school level script. Zombie movies work if they have a moral point or even a political point. This movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification is emphasized. This is as exciting and convincing as a Republican convention, not sorry to see the Republican convention would be a better example of a zombie movie.
