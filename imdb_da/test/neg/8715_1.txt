It is amazing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaking handheld camera and all), (generally) poorly behaved, indescribable mess that seemed more like a high school movie project with the kids experimenting in black and white film making. Injection of poetry poetry instead of a story does not make an art film. When we saw this in the theater, people began to grab the giggles (we included) by the infinite stupidity of this self-abandoned, wobbly mess. And believe me, it seems endless. Had we finished our candy and popcorn, we would also have gone out of the theater with the other two dozen people packing up and leaving to look for something more interesting to do!
