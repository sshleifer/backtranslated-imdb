This show started okay, but it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the participants. Most of them were weird. They did stupid things alive and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, a guy said he was talking to his pants. It's sick and repulsive. Also, no one worried about winning money. All they would ever do was make alliances as if it were "survivors" or something. The men were always afraid that the women should go together. The women were the same too. I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to stop seeing it. It was truly one of the worst shows ever.
