This movie is by far the worst movie ever. The story is weak and never shows what happens to the people after 20 had left their hands. This really mistake me. It draws on and off without meaning, very boring. The only good thing was the cast, WOW, lots of big time actors and actress in it. But besides that, it was terrible, terrible and abominable, doing yourself a favor, not seeing it. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 out of 10
