Wow ... This movie really sucks really ... 'Nuff said. The story: A psychopathic internet predator rods and lures young men and women into torture traps ... It goes like that, kidnap people, they find him, he becomes a changed man and released again on the world again, returns to his old ways and starts The torture again .... The story is stupid, it's impossible. The characters are stupid, they are incredible ... or at least over the top. It has some very violent pictures, and if you have a stomach, you can just be gone ... But once again, even if you don't have a stomach, you might stay away ... It's stupid. <br/> <br /> Cast: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage ... If you're a dead hard fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, you might find this interesting as he is the author and star of this movie. His plays are ridiculously bad, and you can tell he is the one who wrote the God-fearing script. Kevin Gage ... Now they say he's been to many other movies I've seen, but I can't remember him from any of them ... And you can't remember him from here ... These two unfortunately, do the movie ... they do not do well for you ... they just do it ... one to five scales: 1 it is bad ... it is very very bad. .. In fact, it's so bad that this movie should come with a clip that puts a gun to play Russian rolled with ...
