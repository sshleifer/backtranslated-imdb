There was nothing far-fetched about this movie. It's fun with various sports movies and clich√©s, but nothing about it is extremely fun. Most of the movies they parody don't even fit into the movie and are really only theirs so they can be in it. Not the main actor was well thrown in it, but it's really the only good thing about this movie. Also, the various comos in it were sweet to see, but I have no idea why they would waste their time in this piece of waste. Thank God I spent only $ 4 on it, as it's not worth spending money. Just see if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.
