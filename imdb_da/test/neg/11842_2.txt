We all know that the world is full of risky, rip-off horror movies. Some of these can be fun to watch because of their stupidity, horrible effects and even dialogue. But Raptor, who could have been in the same league as the equally meaningless Carnosaur series, does not even seem to enjoy it. It is so badly done, it is really unbearable, even if you just see it with the intention of having a home day at home. Where do we start Well ... the sets are pretty boring. My old drama group created more realistic phases. The genetic laboratories look as if they are from a university, and it looks just as incredibly extroverted (even to cover up, why should you place yourself near civilization where people can easily hear the dinosaur) while doctors do not the? I don't even have to believe it. Next in the flap list are the creation effects; Well, what can I say? Absolutely pitiful. I also think it is worth mentioning that the woman's breasts should be mentioned as an effect. Both of the greatest female characters have apparently had boob jobs, and that brings the characters down, as a woman is a respected policeman, while the other is the sweet "innocent" daughter of the city's sheriff. However, the action is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused for at least trying a little to give his role something. That's where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer to make his sharp performance look even more pathetic, while the female leader looks so boring. (Even though with this movie you can leave her off). The other character I want to point out is the daughter who lets her boobs do all that works in the "healthy" sex scene (ten minutes of endless resumes of her jumps on top of some blocks). <br /> <br /> All in all and summed up as one. Don't bother, just don't.
