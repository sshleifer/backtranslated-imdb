Just read through the other comments here, and was a little surprised to find out that no one had said anything about the play or plot. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can both deliver a fantastic stand-up comedy show. They are not the great actors. Enough about that. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? Oh man. Every time the movie tries to "trick you" into believing that the good will lose, you know these scenes: "What? The good guys are losing? Oh ... I see, it was just a trick", so done terribly bad you can see it a mile away. <br /> <br /> It had 2 or 3 fun moments, but not enough to save the day. It's a little stupid that these comments should be 10 lines now. A lot of people will fill it with crap, for it to be justified. Being short is an art.
