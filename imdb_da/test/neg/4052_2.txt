My friends and I just finished seeing an example of this new Australian movie. Anyone who was in the cinema agreed what was the meaning of this movie? There was no good story to follow, the signs were undeveloped, and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it bizarre that this movie, which probably costs in the high millions, was funded and made. It does not serve any purpose for the drama community, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema. It was really a waste of time to create this droll unemotional job, and more time should really be spent working-shopping scripts and creating good stories, not creating a mess like this. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were OK, but severely hampered by a bad script. Pia Miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were at best average. A true waste of talent. The saving grace was Geoffrey Simpson's ACS filmography, which, like most Aussie films, was amazing. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about it next time, be so welcome. <br /> <br /> 4/10
