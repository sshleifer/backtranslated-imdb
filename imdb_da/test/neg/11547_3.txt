This movie actually begins to be quite interesting, but for my taste it degenerated too quickly into a boring and predictable melodrama. None of the shows are particularly interesting, and the camera's work is just standard TV movie stuff, so there's really no reason for anyone to watch this movie unless they're just as big of a Jeff Bridges fan as I think I am. <br /> <br /> Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he stops college to go. His parents believe that he is "just acting" and talking about how "he has no plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he must discover his true self and his place in the world. So much in fact, he invites them to go with him and buy an antique bus to go in, as he and his father are repairing in true television movie father-son bonding fashion. Up until about this point in the movie, I was a little interested in the plot and the characters, and I wanted to see how his mother-in-law (Vera Miles) responded to life on the road. There is a fun scene early where the father and son must convince her to take the trip with them. They show her the inside of the bus, and she is gradually becoming more and more interested, eventually leaving in a huff with some kind of talk about curtains against blinds on the windows. Bridges tells her father (Carl Betz, equipped with radio announcer voice) that she has changed her thoughts. Father assures him "electric oven ... works every time!". <br /> <br /> But the film goes downhill almost as soon as they hit the road. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some "friends" of his who turn out to be random people they meet at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a little disappointed ... especially since it became obvious that the rest of the film would take place at the festival site and not actually on the road. But at least I thought there might be a decent band as well, if they couldn't afford Hendrix or Stones maybe they would at least have Canned Heat or Little Feat or something. No dice - apparently, the only music at this festival is a horrible grain group with orchestra that sounded like a bad imitation of the fifth dimension, along with an annoying announcer who was supposed to be humorous. <br /> <br /> We are also introduced to a set of hippy festival goers and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a beautiful blonde girl with existentialism and nature on her mind who falls in love with Mike before revealing that she needs kidney dialysis to live and has run to the festival to die. And 2 other campers are determined to have a baby in their raw tent, introducing the battle between modern medicine and hippy ignorance (or something like that). All in all, the longer this becomes the more painful, the movie becomes someone who hopes for an element of surprise or real drama. In principle, this movie is a waste of time, although it would probably entertain anyone who is really in the late 60s, early 70s and movies of that time. I would be just as happy if I never see it again though.
