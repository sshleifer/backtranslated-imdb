Fellow noir devotees, don't be deceived, this is a stinker ... badly busy, badly acted and there is nothing ... nothing here for the movie buff looking for another solid B movie from the gold mine in the 40's and 50's era's era of classics. I gave it a sample based on the relatively high rating on IMDb. There is no account for taste, but I found nothing in this movie to recommend to other IMDb members. This is a classic example of watching a movie and feeling as though you have been cheated out of x minutes that it took the movie to come to its grateful death. Having Alan Ladd on the DVD / Band cover is almost fraud, he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue! This is not this gun for the gentlemen's people ... it's a classic in the lice feel of the studios that wrap out feed without budget ... We're looking for all the great ... save your time at Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets ... it's miserable!
