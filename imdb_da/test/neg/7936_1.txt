You expect it to be young, but at least you expect a complete and coherent film. What a waste. I am extremely disappointed, not just by having seen a bad movie, but having such a good concept will be the trouble of a common movie that we have all seen before. If this crud makes $ 1 over its budget, the studio would be wise to declare victory, clean up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste under Yucca Mountain, and never make another movie like that again. Most of this movie will keep you in mind: "This is not what I wanted to see." This movie appeals to the unintentional and perhaps to teenagers. It's a real shame because most movies are made for the demographic. I had much higher hopes on this movie.
