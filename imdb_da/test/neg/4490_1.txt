The movie starts in the spring of 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college students Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) in pause. Within the two weeks they fall in love with each other (!). But he has to go to war and she has to go to college. They do, but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to re-register - she wants him to stay home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Hysterically bad romantic drama. Leathers are attractive - Tatum is definitely a beautiful man with beautiful green eyes and a warm body (he has introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfing) ... but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it, it was me and my friend who struggled hard not to laugh out loud at some of the "romantic" dialogues in the beginning. It was just awful. For the first hour or so, I was either upset by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrible "romance". Then, after the first hour, tragedies kick in, and I must admit, had me in tears. But the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure you cry with death, funerals and encounters with people who break into tears. How can you not cry? This would have worked if the action was better. Tatum's face never changes expression - not even! He always had a look at his face. Seyfried was a little better but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on the screen at all! They hardly looked like they liked each other, let alone love each other. There were some beautiful photographs of the Carolinas, but this is a boring and silly romantic "drama". A 1 all the way ... and I usually love stupid romantic dramas like this!
