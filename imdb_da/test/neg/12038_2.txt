A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are mistakenly accused of killing their daughter. People start to wonder if they did. The police are investigating and finding suspicious evidence. The couple are malignant by the public and accused in the press. The police wonder that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are charged and brought to court. They are represented by publicity lawyers who give them bad advice and count them $ 100,000. The evidence presented to them is angry or hidden by the police. Produced intimidation of sexual abuse is presented. Their second child is taken away from them and placed in foster care. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to finding her baby removed. Judging, she didn't, but he did. He goes to the slam with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> In the final third of the film, with Dillon in prison and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly come to the couple's defense. Witnesses admit to having lied. Other facts are highlighted, which ultimately result in Dillon's release. The killer has never been found, even though the film gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp. <br /> <br /> This is a weeper from start to finish. Nothing seems to go right for the couple. Oh, there are a few happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and tear up with joy, or some evidence of evidence has been discovered to their advantage and people are hugging each other. But it is never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news, and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (It's usually not something that is due to moving tragedies, although I can't imagine what pleasure we get from watching people. There are also plenty of tragedies in Shakespeare. I suspect what we find interesting about tragic stories are in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm Fortune's fool!" Romeo cries after killing Julie's brother. Here we have Dougherty running in her cloak through a hospital corridor and shouting: "Where's my baby ?? ? "There is no ambiguity or irony in the story - as I am sure there must have been in the real life events on which it is based. People are either good or bad here. Otherwise, they are bad, so they become good. <br /> <br /> The movie is not aimed at exploring the human quirkiness or how things work, it is tearing tears from the audience, the actors providing first-rate role models, I can't remember the last movie where I so many toes There are tears. Showers of them. Cascades by them. A true Niagara of them. A Lake Lacrymose of them. <br /> <br /> Well, I will give an example of the effectiveness of the movie. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago cop working on the site as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner is sympathetic to them, but he does not really do much. He seems to be in the movie, not because of his importance to the case, but because he can give the sacrificed couple some kind of philosophy - "Learn to live with it", which is okay - and because he suffers from colorectal cancer, so we can see him take his medication, double over with pain and finally go away. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating about the movie is that it focuses so intensely on the couple's suffering that it equates to one of the more important issues it raises - the function of the gossip in regulating privacy. Gossip is a strange thing really. If we call it "gossip" it is bad, but if we call it "public opinion" it sounds at least acceptable. Of course, we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is again brought to court accused of pursuing a young boy, and I wonder how many of us excited about the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) But gossip is also not too bad . It's like water. When properly controlled, it is a community activity. We need gossip to keep each other in line. It helps us maintain public order. But as water in a river or tsunami it is devastating to a village when it rages out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that's okay if you're not looking too much in the way of insight into human nature. It has been made so wise that, given its objectives, it is difficult to argue with it.
