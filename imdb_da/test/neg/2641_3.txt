This "horror" movie lacks any horror or even mild tension. Even doing is not good. The reason wanted some promise if it was done by someone who was worried about what they were writing / filming, but the people who made this movie obviously did not. Basically, the film goes into a series of passports and starts as follows: <br /> <br /> The protagonist insists that she is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" lurks in his yellow raincoat or rides in front of a car on his bike. The protagonist insists that she is not crazy and ramps about her passion as a schoolteacher. Everyone is killed in an unsatisfactory manner. <br /> <br /> The protagonist insists that she is not crazy and measures a few false cords. <br /> <br /> Do we see a pattern here? If you don't, enjoy this movie. Otherwise, see something else. The budget is low, low and low, and it shows (unlike, The Evil Dead, who forgets about its crap budget), and the play is bad, bad, bad (with the exception of the caretaker). Generally, the movie is boring, boring, boring. I can't think of a single scene that is actually well done. In fact, I didn't like the movie so much that I actually turned it off ten minutes before the end, something I rarely do ... heck, I saw the unrelated MANOS, CLONES and WILD WILD WEST all the way through. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save yourself and see PHANTASM again.
