The third and final big screen spins from the very popular ITV sitcom in the early 1970s. HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is as resilient and raw as the two previous stakes, and observing a point of view three and a half decades later is what constitutes the plot surrounds Stan Butler's (Reg Varney) adventure, his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and their bumblingly autocratic Inspector Blake (Reg Varney). Stephen Lewis) after their orders from their regular jobs at the bus depot. They all find work in similar positions at a vacation camp with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins) as a result. <br /> <br /> British cinema had a deserved and substantial reputation for high quality in the 1960s, but much of this was due to US financial support and guidance, which unfortunately joined as the 1970s. Then, remarkable homegrown titles (GET CARTER are among these very few excitations) became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and the British cinema went down the road for cheap budgets, sleazy and priceless sex comedies (The CONFESSIONS series , COME PLAY WITH ME) and flabby, elongated celluloid versions of various TV shows, mostly sitcoms (this is one of many hideous examples). Only DAD's ARMY and PORRIDGE came quite respectfully in this respect, the quirky success of the first ON THE BUSES movie (it was the biggest box-office hit of the year in 1971, sensible to think now!) Led to two more successors. To be fair, the TV series even had a cheerful, mature, non-PC vulgarity about what was reasonably tolerated in half hour sitcom form, but stretched to three times as long, it taxed patience out of faith. It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS produced this effort as it almost resembles a horror movie in the literal sense, with old puns, hackneyed, bad timed slapstick and horrible, seedy production values. <br /> <br /> A chance to send the cheeses such as the British holiday season is completely wasted here in favor of the above elements and it is most bizarre, if not cruel, to see it of course 50 something Varney and the beaky -nosed, long-toothed Grant who manages to instantly charm young women hardly in their early twenties while constantly laughing at their own bravado and paralyzing jokes. The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (from STEPTOE AND SON), which holds the old Miss Hare, also does not help, and although the film lasts approx. 1 and a half hours, it draws in an interminably depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this was the last movie in this most obscure movie trilogy, and the TV series itself came to an end around the same time with a sequel (NOT drinking the water, which was critically savaged by the critics and ignored by the audience) after 1975. Most of the leading players involved were not seen much afterwards, but the worst hit was Bob Grant.Afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years, he commi suicide in 2003. A sad coda to a sitcom that was The most popular in its era (nor has it been too good for the age) and should have remained that way rather than the three economically successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids that diluted the good memories and occasional profits are the TV counterpart. <br /> <br /> RATING: 2 and a half out of 10.
