This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger as stars as the ornery grandfather, Charlie, is in full exaggerated fashion, hoping the more flashy he is, the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last true movie legends and to see him in this movie (although End of Days is the 2nd worst movie I've ever seen) is truly heartbreaking. From the bad story to the non-existent direction, it becomes immensely clear that the only reason this movie was made was that the producer's surname ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad, it's really hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod is a Jor-El wig from Superman and a big black porn mustache. One only hopes that his follow-up film, I Believe in America, from Uber producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
