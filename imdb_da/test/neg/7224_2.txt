The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it shows bands and their music when it switched to NY during '81. With regard to the film itself, it has at least three major errors. First of all, there is narration throughout the film, which is not required at all. In the few places where there is an explanation, it is necessary to add a small dialogue that would have gone a long way. Second, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the sound. In fact, it is quite clear that most of the dialogue was recorded later without attempting to match the movie. The third mistake was at the end. I will not give the end to the brave souls who would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting. Not worth the money or time it takes to see this unless you are the fan of one of the bands represented.
