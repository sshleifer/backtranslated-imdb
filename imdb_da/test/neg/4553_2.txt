It may well be the worst movie I've seen in my life. Usually I don't see movies like this, but I was forced to watch this at school. What a bother! The story is as average and boring as it can be: Boy meets girl at the Spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love. At the end of the film, the film becomes a kind of strange kung-fu movie, where the guys in white fight the guys in black. Terrible! The action is so bad that it makes you laugh. The dances in the movie, which I think are cool, are so simple and ridiculous that even I can do them! And Georgina Verbaan may be the most annoying person I've ever seen on the screen. Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming the Dutch Ed Wood. His movie is so bad that they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> However, Victor LÃ¶w gives a surprisingly good performance, and Daan Schuurmans also works OK. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your own sake don't see this movie But if you like to see soaps, it can be very worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
