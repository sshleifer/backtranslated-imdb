As an avid Disney fan, I wasn't quite impressed with this movie, certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters. However, I am so happy that I caught it on DVD and saw the special features. You need to check "Moose commentary": The whole movie can be seen with comments from Route and Tuke, the comic relief moose of history, spoken by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans from the famous Second City Comedy Troupe ad-lib - in character - for an hour and a half about a movie they are clearly proud of. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I received from this comment was entirely for the weak reaction I had on the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
