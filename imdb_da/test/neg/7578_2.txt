I don't know, but the movie was just like other movies I've seen. The Ring, The Eye, Dark Water, they are all the same to me. Don't make me wrong, it's beautifully made, nice camera work, good graphics, but that story is too .. too ordinary. In the end, it's the score that makes the excitement you know: the screams, rumbles. The characters in the film also do not react very naturally and move very slowly, surprised at everything they see. I know some people who love this kind of movie, and if you do, being a well-made movie, I don't think it hurt to see it. But if you've seen the movie, I mentioned above and didn't like them, then I suggest you don't bother.
