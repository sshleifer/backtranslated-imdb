I remember seeing this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. After reading the comments on this title, I have to agree with those of the people of Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, and for me it seemed no more than an exercise in jingoist, flag-waving American nationalism, where American athletes are glorified for everyone's expense. Some other nationalities would have the right to feel deeply offended in the way they were portrayed in this series. However, it can help explain how many American spectators appeared at the 1984 Olympics and television coverage, which seemed to be only of interest to events that the Americans were likely to win.
