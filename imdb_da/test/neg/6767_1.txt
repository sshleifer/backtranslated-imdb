RAP, the book on which this movie was based, was one of the hardest books I've ever read. But I couldn't put it down. Raunchy, raw, foul, creepy ... you name it, it had it. It also had some of the best characterizations of any novel I've ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, as for the girl ... it was regrettable. I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the strangest mutha ... talking 'about WASCO ... Mcintire as Wasco is like casting Tim Conway as Charles Manson. What happened to the main character in the book? Small heritage. He doesn't even exist in the movie ... Quick walk was NOT the main guy in the book. Why even mention credit this thing with THE RAP? None of the spirit, atmosphere, nastiness or drama in the book was taken in this movie. <br /> <br /> For me it was not just a disappointment but a total waste of time and celluloid.
