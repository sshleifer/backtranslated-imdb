I will admit that when I started watching this movie, it hit me that forced me to see it through to its conclusion. Probably this was a latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero continue with his victim, or perhaps fascination, that they got the means to do, distribute, and show this movie that kept me looking for it for profit, Or perhaps some bizarre desires-fulfillment fantasy that might be a point at the end of all the pain. But not so lucky. <br /> <br /> So you're warned not to start seeing it in the first place, so the same thing happens to you. There is nothing here to waste your and half an hour on. <br /> <br /> The first person mockumentary and schtick about Fabian's "quest" to impregnate women in Falklandland comes out even more like a sophomoric (perhaps Freshman - high school freshman, that is) movie student project than you might imagine . The effect ends up being both insidious with the locals (who, apart from the two professional leads, are actually real people) and engage in rather disgusting sexual policies (whether you take it all literally or symbolically, it is meaningless and sexist ). The reason I ended up seeing it all is the same reason that when you first opt ​​for a scab, there is an irresistible fascination to continue doing so until it's completely gone, even when you know It's bad for you. You just want to see what happens. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's pretty dishonest filmmaking, because apparently it doesn't have any moral center, no illumination of the local political situation, or anywhere in the type of politically-sexually-personal film universe of Goddard. In short, it has nothing to say and spends a long time as if it does. Smug would be the one word tagline. I would suggest the movie makers rent 'Waiting for Guffman' a couple of times, or hell, even the 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to pursue schtick with a little more style and a little more real feel. Or at least entertainment value.
