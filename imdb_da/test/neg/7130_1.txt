This "remake" is a complete disgrace: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it would not deserve more than a few spiteful lines. It is also a cheat, with a ridiculous script served by such constructed and amateur "acting", you are always aware that there is a set, a camera, a fake, no direction, no suspended reality whatsoever, so you can dive into the story. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic, stinging excitement of the tiny rooms and rooms of the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) are all lost here in overcrowded sets and spaces. But the worst of all is the moral enormity and intolerable suffering, both of which proclaimed a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims transformed into relentless revenge ghouls, completely destroyed by utter nonsense and hollow boogie-man style scares. <br /> <br /> If American audiences are not willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead they deserve this pathetic curse: the film itself.
