This movie is scary at times, maybe no more than when a naked George Kennedy tells his hooker girlfriend he wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, his nudity is covered by a blanket, but the image is still more terrible than anything you will probably find in, for example, Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie was inspiring; It inspired me to watch another movie. In a scene when a flight attendant notes about male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it's called a" cock "pit?" Charming. <br /> <br /> And, contrary to what some have written, this movie is very, very bad.
