If there's anything worse than this movie, I won't see it. I remember so many wonderful things - a nun fell out of a coffin to make a fleet for a little blond boy; the little blonde boy himself loved as a god; lots of stock footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should blow up any notion that Peru is a holiday paradise. It's all so terrible that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treatment by comparison. This movie must bomb and be punished and bomb again.
