The animation is great, I admit it. But Disney continued every stereotype that Alaskans has been trying to overcome over the past two generations. And the names I mean, come on ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denahi (cheesy takeoff of Denali)?! These are real places where real people live! And the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the ground, seeking revenge on this little little girl. Disney, you are based in California and Florida, right in the middle of the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you can't hold on to what you know, at least hire and / or work with people who know what area you're trying to caricuture. Maybe it wouldn't be so insulting! :(
