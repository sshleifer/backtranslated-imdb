The critics were like "a movie that will break your heart" etc. So a friend of mine and I had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I want to make it brief and leave it up to others to write about the content. This movie is trying to touch you to reach your heart. But it fails. At least for me. And for my friend too. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened just happened on the screen. It was always there, not here where I am. I thought most of the time. "Hmm, something happens on the screen, but it's only on the screen. It's not right." <br /> <br /> Films that managed much better to touch me: East of Eden (1955), Terms of Endearment (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002)
