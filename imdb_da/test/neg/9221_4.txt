This is a silly movie with a lot of singing and dancing. Action is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. Buddy Epsen can remember performances, with a short but excellent performance by Gypsy Rose as a bitter wife to a rich playboy. An absolutely incredible depiction of college life that ends with an excellent skating show of Alice in Wonderland. Many parts are worth watching, but don't be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie
