As a native Chinese, I cannot accept this kind of idea that some people should die for a 'better world'. I said 'better the world' because it is a lie that Chinese have been indoctrinated for a thousand years! <br /> <br /> I think most Western audiences cannot know Qin Shihuang (meaning first emperor), the king of this movie is the most infamous tyrant in ancient China. Tianxia (Chinese word was spoken by the king, means "the land and the people") spoken by the mouth is completely false. From one to the other, all the king of ancient China spoke the same thing, but very few of them did as they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that the Qin Shihuang empire lasted only about twenty years before it was destroyed by humans. I like the beautiful scenes in this movie, but it can't make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
