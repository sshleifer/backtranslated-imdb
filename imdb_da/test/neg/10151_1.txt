I love cheesy horror movies, I think they are dead alive and bad taste is great, and I think dormant massacre II (not even related to this movie) is fun. But this movie stank completely, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it .. you can see all kinds of bugs that aren't even campy. The best shot of the scene where the woman leans out through the window is the one where she tastes the head of the frame? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Don't rent this mindset, it's related to the sleep party massacre series. It's terrible, and I don't even have a clue as to how it became a distribution. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, benefit everyone else.
