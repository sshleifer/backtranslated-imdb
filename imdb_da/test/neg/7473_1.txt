I saw this at a driveway when I was 9. Everything I remember is a couple of scenes (those where the protagonist Elle is being chased by a guy in a mask) and afraid of spidless. Seeing it now, my opinions have changed. It is a pathetic "horror" movie about an ophanage run by Gloria Grahame (sad) and deals with a young, talented girl Elle who is sent there after her mother, the city's tramp, was killed by a hammer (graphically shown). The film has young people (actually actors in their 20s) being beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked by meat splitters, raped, etc. The brutal hammer murder is the opening scene, and then it gets worse and worse. There is nothing to recommend about this crap. The reason is stupid, the whole dialogue is bad and the actor ... the less said the better. How did this disease start with a GP (now PG) rating? It would get an R now. Worthless. One last thing ... a really disgusting twist ending suggests incest!
