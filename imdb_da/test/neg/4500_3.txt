Gamera vs Viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result. Space Aliens tries to take over the ground and is stopped by Gamera. So they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys. Foreigners then take control of Gamera and make him attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that I really enjoyed the monster race at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras look like a large squid with a beak. He has no energy weaves and doesn't shoot any rays, but he can close the pendants on top of his head to make a sharp angled weopon. So generally this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and is decent. Viras really hurt Gamera badly by sticking his underside of his shell with his pointed head and I'm surprised that Gamera could survive this. Unfortunately, Gamera vs. Viras decided to use footage from previous Gamera movies to fill the time for this movie. They show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when foreigners look at cameras in previous games. But when they show Gamba's matches with Gaos, they show the battle between Gamera and Gaos first in the city, so show the last match between the two. After showing used recordings of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos, they show the first match between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing the games in non-chronological order. They didn't even have to show the first match they should have just stopped after they showed the final match between the two. Another problem is that they decide to display images of Gamera-infested cities when foreigners order him to attack Tokyo. So they show the scene from "Gamera vs Barugon" where he destroys the pond. After stage scenes from "Gamera The Invincible" which is a big problem for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in black and white !!!! Using stock footage from a black and white film in a COLOR movie is really lazy, and that's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Duplication is also bad again. The two small children are not so annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that did not involve young children. <br /> <br /> So, over the use of other Gamera Films recordings, this movie is a deterrent. The final match is fantastic, so I highly recommend skipping for the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has already been seen before.
