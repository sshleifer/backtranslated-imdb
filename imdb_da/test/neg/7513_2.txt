This is a polarizing film. People either love it or despise it, it works. I despise it. The movie comes from the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but while it's a masterpiece, it's just awful. Both films take Kafka's unfinished novel - America, for their inspiration and the general ideal. America is a surreal story of a youth's journey through the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer, one that does not change during the journey (although the book is about 300 pages and still works only a quarter past so we never know). Allows Kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurd / surrealistic situations and surroundings. Oh Lucky Man follows the same template to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell and Weekend does the same for France. Both films are also very British, using various tricks and techniques to point out that this is not true, it is confusion, etc. But the difference comes when Oh Lucky Man uses the constructed film to convey life's absurdity and class system. Weekend uses the constructed film to bludge us to death with ideological controversy. Because Godard goes beyond Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we end up with two principal characters where we have no investment at all. We have to spend 90 minutes with them, but we couldn't care less about them. Consciously so. But by doing so, Godard leaves us a film about his own message only, which in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and indulgent symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed at the camera. Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes like the really awful pigs slaying, much worse than any of the off-camera violence in the car crashes. The end result is like listening to a student's political apparatchik drone on and on and about his views while repeatedly kicking your head so you get the message. The problem with Brecht is if you alienate the audience too much, you have alienated them from what you are trying to convey. As always, myself seemed clear. <br /> <br /> However, the parts that really hold onto the craw for this movie are the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the treetree in the beginning and off-screen comic rape in the middle, which, although it could be considered as allegorical, the belief of the film in itself destroys, and it is signs how little existed in the first place. It's so French with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> See Oh Lucky Man instead. It's a genius work. Weekend is an enchantment. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and just for the paper jam scene and piano scene, which are just brilliant, even though they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfactory as without them, this is a bad movie of the worst most pretentious instructor in the world With them, it is well understood that this is a damn good technical director who makes the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. Somehow it is far worse.
