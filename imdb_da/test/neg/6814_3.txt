Very strong, very boring, not really drama. Why not just make a documentary? This is not exactly the passion of Joan of Arc. The only reason to see Chronicles is to hear the performances. I love Bach's music and even I found it hard to sit through this misery in a movie. The great Gustav Leonhardt player (in two senses of the word) Bach. We don't get much of a sense of him as an actor, since he has had so little to do dramatically. For the most part, he gets targeted or angry out of different spaces. Of course, Bach's life was not an Errol Flynn movie. It was actually quite boring and more than a little hard. It probably means that life is not a great candidate for a movie. The music is of course another story. I recommend the stations in Bach. Far more information, for one thing, and some insight into the music, which is, of course, why Bach interests us first.
