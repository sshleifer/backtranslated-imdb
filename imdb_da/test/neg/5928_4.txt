Sometimes I think somewhere in the "Lifetime" office complex is a room where the writer is connected to a large wheel on the wall - like the big six in casinos. The latter has many spots where you win even money and fewer for bigger amounts until there are perhaps a couple who pay bigger money. <br /> <br /> However, I picture channel wheels with about six different genres on its wheels, with two of those appearing the most, labeled "The Psychotic Neighbor" or "The Spouse with a Hidden Past or Secret or Both. " "Lifetime" movies have a few repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. Category "Spouse ..." may have a long-term spouse, but someone expresses or an event arises that the good wife once was a hooker was one of the couples involved in one or the other. another horrible act long ago, or that something else in one of the backgrounds of different presumed etc. or as in this flick, one of them has entered the marriage with the most amazing goals. One constant, in all their genres is that the man or other men are usually clueless, vacuous, and slowly having an idea of ​​what the hell is going to climax, or at best very late in the matter (unless he is miscreant). Not the case here. <br /> <br /> Whether the referenced miscreant can be the "neighbor" or as in this offer, "wife", is always fascinating, how easy, successful and effortless they continue with their dastardly deeds. They manipulate many of the others, beat them if necessary, take on different things, and juggle more fraud than you can count - with incomplete success until just before the end. <br /> <br /> The main role here as many in this channel's movie is an old hand. I noticed another movie where he starred was "The Perfect Neighbor." Finally, the avid "perfect wife" in this flick sends those lying in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent "scarce man" in Don Corleone's family could muster. And I couldn't help imagining that Jack Nocholson's Melvin Udall character from "As Good as It Comes" with his massive OCD affliction could afford the dominion that would help deal with the occupation that was the basis for this opus.
