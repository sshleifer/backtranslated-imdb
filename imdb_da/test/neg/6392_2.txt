Michael Caines character has problems. He is an ordinary short-sighted, insecure man in the mid-40s. He's married, but his wife doesn't seem to love him anymore. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that an astonishingly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, is pursuing him ardently, kissing him, poking him, and trying to start sex at every opportunity. What should the poor guy do? <br /> <br /> This movie must be taken out of the comedy section and placed under science fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can pretty much get her - she goes with a clumsy, aging loser. This goes beyond a medieval male imagination in something so erroneous, you just hope that everyone involved was volunteered. There is nothing fun here. There are some quick attempts at Caine, who often seem to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like a nail on a blackboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has a crying scene that wouldn't pass patterns in a high school - but she's beautiful and she takes off her clothes. Then buy the DVD, jump to scenes 4 and 9, and forget the rest.
