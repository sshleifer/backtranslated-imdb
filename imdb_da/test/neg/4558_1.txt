I am in awe of the number of people who consider this movie to be decent ... much less amazing! Do most people even have basic standards for a movie they see? I just don't know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial movie product" doesn't really deserve the respect for being called a movie. Calling Dean Cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent. I have had great respect for Lori Petty, but most things have gone straight down the pipes. At least her role was extremely small. Maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to be paid. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while viewing "Firetrap" was amazing. Let me start by getting it from my chest: If you can't show fire realistically, don't show it at all. Okay?!! It's an embarrassment to everyone involved when showing lame effects that don't even come close to simulating a really burning building. <br /> <br /> Some interesting tidbits: 1. A caretaker opens the door to a large storage cabinet and finds the whole room engulfed in flames. What is he doing? He tries to put out the fire with his diet 2. The same guardian (who knows that the building is on fire) later comes across a door labeled "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind tells him that it would be a good idea to open the door. Big mistake! 3. A woman gives a great generous donation of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she has a coat on the charity event they hold! (Didn't people who care about animals being something shaken on that kind of thing?) 4. Several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls, even an electromagnetic pulse (!!) could not penetrate. Nevertheless, they have a spacious air vent that leads right into the back of what everyone could go through. It certainly looks like an obsolescence in security. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I got tired of thinking about this lame movie. Our "hero", which we are supposed to cheer for, is a career criminal who tries to kill some police officers early. What a bulging guy! If the public wants to waste their minds away on this drive then more power for them. I just wish I could get it deleted from my memory. 1.10
