Personally, the book was a very well-written, fantastic, exciting piece that was not addressed to the film. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that much of the book was omitted, frustrated me as it hit the "various" result of the movie. There was something to be desired from this movie, but all in all, it lacked in plot. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has NOT read the book, I could see how this movie would be considered inviting and entertaining with its controversy and excitement. But for a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, I did not see the strong connection between the two: both film and novel. <br /> <br /> With big characters missing (like Maximilian Kohler) and suddenly turning in the plot with the survival of the last cardinal in preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly flooded, leading to another take in the conclusion of history. Hassassin was also portrayed as an ordinary white man compared to that of the novel, where he was portrayed as a Muslim; His motifs in the book are mainly based on his ties with the Illuminati, but in the film his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than any personal tie to the task at hand.
