This movie, like so many others (Remember Titans, Miracle), follows the basic sports movie formula: There's a guy he's a dunk. Jerk does bad. Jerk must play the rules of others. Student's rules change Jerk, Jerk becomes good. Insert tragedy (Death, drugs, riots, etc.). Tragedy Effects Jerk, makes him completely changed. Jerk must now play championship games. Lots of close-ups on sweating players and the balls. Jerk wins. Quote from coach or news or something that explains the title. Credits. Were you not touched? These films can now be used to clarify the morons of society. Anyone who pays to watch this in theaters must be beaten.
