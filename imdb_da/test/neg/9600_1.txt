I'm a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs Python" and working to build my collection for such great titles as "Troll 2" and "What's up Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it the list of wonderfully horrible movies. It's just lamb. The guy who said he had a better dialogue with his potted plants is right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot the guy runs into the car, it almost seems like he knew it was going to blow, there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction. "Judge, jury and executor". "The perfect policeman ... but they went too far," I mean, why do people continue to make these movies more? R.O.T.O.R. do it because it is hysterically terrible, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it is not even bad enough to be so bad it is worth seeing. This belongs to a person's movie collection, something they can be so proud of, but it is all. I suspect it was on a HBO channel (with only 1 star, so I looked at it) because it didn't belong to it. Even if you love bad movies, don't watch this movie. It's shameful.
