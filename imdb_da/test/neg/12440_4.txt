If you liked William Hickey in "Prizzi's Honor", he revives his character as Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". This is a very weak "Godfather" satire with few laughs. Stuart Whitman looks confused at what he's doing in this schlock party? Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the better bets in the movie and that alone is not a good sign for sure. Eddie Deezen vacillates between "Three Stooges" slapstick and a bad Woody Allen imitation. The fat is deficient, "Mob Boss" is so derived that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film draws on car guns, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other gags. - NOTE
