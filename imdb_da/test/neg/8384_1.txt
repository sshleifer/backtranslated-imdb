I can't seem to find anything that is good with these miniseries. Why in the hell would you ban chocolate when you could ban something much more convenient like smoking or alcohol? Also, the fact that it is an Australian program and its all in England and everyone is faking British accents is stupid. All in all, I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
