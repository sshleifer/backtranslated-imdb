Though it is true that the film is something interesting, the performance leaves much to be desired (like the bloodstains of leather girls, I spit on your grave and are born in flames, all superior). I don't think it's not porn, but porn is in the eyes of the guard: if it works as a porn for anyone, who should I say he / she is wrong? I was rather confused by the statement in Winkimation's generally thought-out review ("such a shame") that "for once we actually see men's faces as they come." Some years ago, I occasionally made freelance reviews for an adult, and I remember seeing lots of men's faces as they came. I think it's more common for the film to show off the few male porn stars (and especially when that man is director). Although I am not surprisingly unable to refer to specific titles, I know there are some cases in Ron Jeremy's work. I also don't know that I agree that a man necessarily shows vulnerability in his face when he comes.
