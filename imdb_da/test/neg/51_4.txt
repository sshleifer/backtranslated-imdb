One of the last surviving horror greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with TV-before-death excerpts from the great Conrad greeting you as you visit. For him and his prisoners, Conrad's body is "borrowed" by a gang of four boys and three girls and led to a large manor house where they drink with him, slice him, dance with him, laugh with and with him, and then lie down. in a coffin that just happens by lying in a room upstairs. The news from the missing body reaches Radzoff's widow and her friend (who are skilled in black art), and she holds a kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that in his own words he can "look at an eye, a tooth for a tooth. "Well, Frightmare is an interesting" bad "movie. Sure, it's cheap. The sets look like they were borrowed (which I am sure they were). The special effects and blood and intestine are made liberally and with little credibility. The action is on average below average with few exceptions. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator's fame is dragging on, but he does really little in this rather incredible role as a horror strike teen who is to steal a dead man's kicks. None of the "children" except the beautiful girl playing Meg is good. Nita Talbot plays the "friend" of Radzoffs with negative interest. Also look for the big one - I mean big guy playing the policeman. It's Porky's even though Porky's fame. But fortunately for all of us, a performance rises over the material. Ferdy Mayne, an often overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee's features and stood as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a more than legitimate work as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. Conrad Radzoff in a bad person in life who lives exclusively for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he himself is dead (apparently none of the swinging teenagers at that time). Mayne can look very royal, speak very elegantly and convey the threat with ease. If for no other reason, see Frightmare for his performance. I do; But think that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff, they used Christopher Lee footage (someone has any thoughts?). Still, one can guess what happens and it actually does: Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids who disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is thin and overused. The action is mostly anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ​​incessancy. Definitely worth a little peek. Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a crooked smile to my lips every time.
