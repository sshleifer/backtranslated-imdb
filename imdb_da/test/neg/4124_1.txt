In a nutshell, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about a weapon factory where secret weapons are developed. Because they do bad things, they are not popular so to speak. A new female CEO comes in to clean up and make sure the company's reputation is improved. She does this by leaking the company's confidential information to the press ... Do you believe this? Besides, she starts turning off people she's never seen. Incredible uh? A pacifist group is trying to destroy the company's mainframe because there is the drawing of these secret weapons. This mainframe is located at the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault. Of course, the movie would not be complete without the evil scientist and robot who is the ultimate killer machine resembling an Alien movie from the Alien movies. The mad scientist likes the female director. The evil scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, and then protects his job, rises in command chain and makes the movie interesting. The pacifists join forces with the CEO and another board member to escape the robot. Further down the row, they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe while avoiding the robot. They also discover that the factory was developing a part-man, some machine soldier. They can delete a person's memory and replace it with a veteran soldier s. One of the pacifists is transformed into such a soldier and wants to hunt the assassin. I think the mad scientist also wrote the script for this movie. This super soldier looks and seems much the same as Robocop, but not so much fun. <br /> <br /> It boils down to this. People are running, being chased by a murderer car, are hurt by it, but they do not seem to be worried by it, besides curving a bit, and of course the female CEO is the leading character of this movie and cannot be killed, ie. Survive every attack, explosion you called it. I don't want to disturb you by the hunt, let's jump to the end. They have lots of weapons, even the pacifist and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, they all empty the weapon on the killer. They enter a lift which is used to clean outside windows. And then the female CEO also knows some magic, on the roof she complained about being out of bullets, and as magic, the gun is reloaded. In this way, she can shoot the cables and let the elevator blow 70 stories or so, and let it stop just above the ground by pulling the brake. And on top of that, the police are waiting for them. The robot jumps after them and kills the police. Hilarious no? The robot shakes them down in the vault, where the main frame is, and when the robot is so close to her that he can touch / kill her, it stops. Because the evil scientist didn't want her to be killed. A better name for this guy would be idiot scientist. Though he is the one who made this movie appear. At the moment I already pulled the killer robot to finish them all so that the movie would end. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie speaks so loudly and so I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's a monster and I'm not talking about Death Machine.
