For many months I was looking forward to this release. The previews looked good, early reports on the web were encouraging, and the golden eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (by the same people). It turns out that I was very misled! Haze had the potential to be up there with Call of Duty 4 and other next generators, but it looks, plays and feels like something from 5 years or so ago. I played Haze on a 1080 TV and was initially disappointed that the game's developers had limited the graphics to 720. The Haze universe lacks detail and atmosphere, the feeling of "they must have really hurried to finish this" is always there. <Br /> <br /> The controls are sluggish and cumbersome, and I have not yet found an adjustment for the x / y axis sensitivity. There are many parts of the singleplay game that are very dark (visually) to the point where you can't actually see where you are going. Why not add a flare function like Halo? or even better, night vision? The use of the performance-enhancing drug "nectar" is interesting, but just as you get used to it, you change sides and not use it again! why worry? I could go on with many more Haze errors, but instead I just want to say Do not BUTHER! wait for killzone 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock gold AK!
