This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the party. I know I know ... but how good is that? Well, let's not be silly. It's still pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a nice movie. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team celebrates new members, one is back in a diabetic coma. Of course, they leave him in a grain field tied to a scarecrow. In line with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred to the scarecrow's body, which comes to life and spreads terrible revenge, indeed, virtually everyone. The assistants drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the grain field. On the sunny beach they are killed one by one by the whistled scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing a tight drama to the movie. Unfortunately, the drama skips good and lands in common cheese. Much of the play was fair, but there were some really horrible bits, including a horrible piece of badly executed lip sync. Some plot points were left mostly unresolved, and most were used to getting someone alone so they could be slaughtered. Again better than previous rates, but still lacking.
