Mel Welles, you can remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, leads this somewhat interesting, yet transformed tale of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter, who performs her father's work after his death and creates a creature that is not its intellectual ability or its likelihood of being / doing good, but rather its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, although a physician and scientist in itself is concerned about really nothing but satisfying her primary desires for the stable boy and making a super sex slave by using her body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. The story is tangible here, and one gets what one might expect: lots of learning and suggestive comments (surprisingly most from the female lead), special effects that are not so special, acting without deep characterization and not really much action or excitement. And while this movie is almost obscure in relation to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein has strangely some aspects that make it easy to see - not very wise, but observable. Italian actor Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays Baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots of sex appeal. She oozes desire and seduction quite well. Her performance is rather one-dimensional, but she is quite nice and plays a little over-top. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my business. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated for European horror movies for money, plays the father in a short but competent performance. He is the star attraction, but gone before the movie really kicks into a gear. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is something effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. When crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, the policeman (I didn't buy it), Mickey Hargitay began pumping Tania in response - despite what you might think, not to her satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the last third of the movie, where the suspect script, weak notions and lack of direction all go south. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The movie ends somewhat abruptly with one of the quick resolutions that are very common in the 1970s. While not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think, Lady Frankenstein is really a very flawless movie with some perverse but exciting overtones.
