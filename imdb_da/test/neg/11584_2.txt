When filmists hear two popular villains / characters will fight, they flock to theaters to see how the fight will end. There is Freddy vs. Jason, where two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And more like that there is Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs Python is just a horrible title and even worse condition. Clearly, the movie is a D-list picture, but at least comes up with a more convincing name, perhaps something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into seeing it. With a name like this you know what you come in. A group of military men / women, including a 20-year-old sexy scientist, is left to the death of the military on an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. As long as they can make it out of the island and to the boat, they are fine, but ... no ... there is a huge python that protects the sea and the road away. Let's hope all these guys can do it from the island, and that python and komodo don't pose each other in a kind of terrible special battle. Really this movie is bad in almost every way. The play is pretty bad, or maybe the special effects are so cheesy that the play is incredible, because no one thinks these people are in danger with creatures resembling that made on an early 90's computer . Nevertheless, this movie is actually quite fun. The creatures are so lumpy in appearance, and the actors really give it their all pretending to be in danger. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh * squawk! * ... But i can not. This PG-13 nominal film actually blows out. Every time a curse word comes, a parrot beeps out of the word. Even words that can be said about network TV. How to get cheap that they bend out words, and with a parrot no less. Eventually these parrots came to me and I couldn't help laughing at the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad, from the stupid beginning to the ridiculous Night of the Living Dead style ending, but it's also kind of fun. As a scary movie, it doesn't fail like an action movie, it fails a little less, but still pretty bad, and like a comedy it shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * Out of ****. 95 minutes. PG-13 for any violence and Squawked out curse.
