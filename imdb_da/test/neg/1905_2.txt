If it wasn't for the Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the dust box! So predictable, so silly and so badly acted !! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess as a single light on the end of the tunnel! <br /> <br /> The worst was Jennifer Rubin's play, surely! Maybe it was because of this script (had they actually actually written one or was it just made up "on the way" ???). <br /> <br /> To cut a long long story: <br /> <br /> It's a MUST SE only for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me), as he is incredibly sexy and well-functioning (struggling hard against this "mentally challenged" script). These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make up a big part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't spend too much money on it. Try to see or get it as cheap as possible (an auction or such) and then stick to the Colin Firth scenes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie can be dangerous to everyone's mental health.
