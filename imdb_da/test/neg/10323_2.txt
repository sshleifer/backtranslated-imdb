Wait until you've seen most other movies ever released, wait a year and see it here when you're ready for something with such low production values ​​that it doesn't challenge any imagination. <br /> <br /> I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production should do it to crouch the data. Everything over 8 would be weird. <br /> <br /> Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair in the short time she was presented, although she exaggerated the New Yorker accent, but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent threw through. The old story for this performed actress who has grown so much since this film. The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-biosection that only constituted Sandra's bio - properly taken from IMDb. It also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus - 3 issues. Hope you get them in order!
