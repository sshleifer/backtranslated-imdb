Early talkie function based on a popular stage game. A murder has been committed and a lot of people employ a medium to conduct a seance to see who the killer is. While the lights are out there, there's another murder ... so it's somebody in that room. What follows is an obvious, boring and creaking killing mystery. Most of those thrown over in a ridiculous way. They appear as if they are on stage (where you have to exaggerate things) and it looks silly on the screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula") who really exaggerates it as a police visit. Static direction of Tod Browning (who was always overstated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for Browning and Lugosi completists. I give it a 3.
