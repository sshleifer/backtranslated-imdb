I went to see this myself to make sure it was suitable for my little boy to see. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, I did because I certainly would not allow any young child to see this. Why? Violence, death, funeral. If you are not ready to explain these concepts to your children, keep them away. Why on earth are these subjects covered by a children's film - especially one that has a roofline of "The original party animals". Can just as well make a gangland performance in a Hello Kitty cartoon. <br /> <br /> There were very few and far between laughs. Speaking to myself there was none. The cows looked as remarkable as the cows in The Far Side comics. I suppose there is nothing original about this movie except for the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all the young children to enjoy.
