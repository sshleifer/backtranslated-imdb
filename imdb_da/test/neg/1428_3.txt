Strangeland is a horrible horror / technological thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer freak who asks for young girls through the chat room. His ridiculous philosophies of pain and suffering are both misguided and completely unfounded. There are no ties to reality with the ideas presented in this movie, it's more like Dee Snider sat down and tried to think of the strange things that were possible to impress horror fans and perhaps some of his old fans, but the end result is just awful. Hopefully for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest, which is the main reason I was fooled into seeing it. I assure you this is not a quality free movie. It is a disturbing but boring attempt to suggest what can happen in the minds of people who treat themselves as Carleton Hendricks did in this movie. The sad part is that nobody does these things to themselves. Marilyn freakin 'Manson doesn't even go so far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film was not meant to poker fun on its type of music (it would be a staff at Snider himself), it is more like Dee Snider tried to rise from career-dead and present himself as a sick person again. Dee, it seems that time has come to let it all die ...
