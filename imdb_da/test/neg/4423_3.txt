This movie is a waste of time. Although it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the film is in the sub-pair and has a clich√© point. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live your life to the full and do what makes you happy." This phrase saves you from wasting hours in your life on this movie. People who like this movie are the same people who would like to sit for two hours before they find out that the whole movie was a dream sequence. If the most important part of the movie will not even happen, at least make it fun to watch and captivating. There is a reason why this project was not a theatrical release, and although indy movies may prove very good, it doesn't even come close.
