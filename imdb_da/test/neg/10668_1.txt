If you feel Reshammiya as a singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try to watch him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is gently all over the film, and it is very comical to see him make the demanding and intense scenes. This is far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it's not luv or reeal) and is complete with him making a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fighting scenes, Himesh being imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder he escapes from prison etc ... If you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this, especially the scenes in which he howls in Mehbooba. If you despise nasal twangs and want to know out of curiosity what two hours Reshammiya can do for you, then don't miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning to the end. The only saving grace that this movie has is cinematography, places and a few songs. Anyway, until you are a die hard Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
