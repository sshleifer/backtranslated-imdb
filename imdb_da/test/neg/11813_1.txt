The worst part about this movie is that it didn't have to be so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, though it does make many movies; they made it look beautiful and beautiful, and the best of them all had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audience who would embrace a lesbian positive film ... yet the author and director went out of their way to lift every one redone film bit about lesbian plague and confusion at boarding schools (you know the place where whole lesbian love lives and dies). <br /> <br /> This is a theme that has been done over and over again and again in movies, but something that viewers - if you use this voice forum as a clue - can't seem to get enough of. <br /> <br /> Every element of this story was so over the top, overly false and constructed that it was painful to sit through. The main characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned genius, the rebellious lesbian hard girl (well, they took a super beautiful femme like Piper Perabo and tried to rough her up, but it didn't matter much) seduce beautiful rich girl destined to betray her. <br /> <br /> Looking at them every step of the way is character 3, a drowsy, well-meaning, wide-eyed, good-looking girl observer. I say 'every step' because she shares her every thought with the audience through the stiffest, most inanimate monologues. <br /> <br /> Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they try oh so, so hard to sound like a fifteen year old would really, um, you know ... chat. "Hear them (love) with their sounds was um, you know like, well ... okay!" She says about her 2 evil roommates who roll around in bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later, she asks Graham Greene - the successful native American actor who is totally wasted in a role as a gardener (!) "Is it wrong to worry about what people think?" Sorry, but is she a teenager or is she 7 years old? <br /> <br /> Granted, Piper Perabo (as Polly tortured dive) & others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to pronounce. Perabo has a good energy level and is of course very comfortable in front of a camera. She would do well in a decent project, so it is by no means a criticism of the actor. <br /> <br /> But this story is shameless in continuing every stereotype about lesbians, all rolled into a character. They could not stop with her (Polly) as an angry, crazy passionate, secret genius that ended mathematical problems for the linguistic teacher. Oh, but it is after she argues with the teacher who dares to accuse her of "gabbing". "It's a word they (men) use against the US (women)!" she says, stomping out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is this ALL the author could come up with? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole and co. Polly continued and made a poetic, dark child who communicates with wild gardens by screaming their names in the woods. <br /> <br /> Cue slow motion, sci-fi, Xena atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we have her writings for her maternal grandmother ... (most lesbians are degenerate orphans if you were in the dark). Then we have two teachers (one uptight, one a zany type with loose neckband) floating around all actions (the school looks terribly large for only 2 teachers) ... and gives dark child / seductive / bird girl tense look. Hmmmm. I wonder if any good thing you know ... um, FUNNY happens between these two teachers. There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. Heartbreak happens, but the author and the director know that lesbian people exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock. I can't reveal the end of respect for those who force themselves to sit through to the end, but if you don't laugh, I can only guess you're crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't mean the wimpy low scenes.
