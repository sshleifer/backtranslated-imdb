I hit it from approx. 50 minutes into it! The one the moron was who decided to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami's book (Battle Royal) and turn it into a pathetic reality TV scenario deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> It has made the movie industry a good trip though. Now, directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say "good at least it's better than Series 7". This piece of crap & Dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made! <br /> <br /> Be warned that this is not so bad, it's good! <br /> <br /> It's a disgrace to Film Makers everywhere! <br /> <br /> Never watch this movie!
