This movie is almost as important as an 'Ozzie & Harriet' or a 'Father Knows Best' episode. An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would give a greater insight into modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter than this weird confusion. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. She seems to be sleeping through the movie. (In view of the movie's title, I understand that her role was a supportive role, but even Martin Short managed a distinctive supporting sign.) I can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. But this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I'm afraid to consider that everyone could enjoy it themselves as pure imagination.
