In 1913, the gruesome owner of a mine in the Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania uses poor children in exploration, and after an explosion, a group of children are buried alive. Currently, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness when family savings have been spent in treatment. Without money, she goes with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains belonging to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay home at night, and Sarah hears there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes Maria's friend, he thinks she is an imaginary friend. But when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah fight her near the mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a bad movie: the play is good; make-up is scary; and movies and music scores are excellent. The story and thus the manuscript is, however, very weak, in fact a poor collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, with the widow moving to a house in a remote location, because the family used all their resources with the patriarch's disease. But when she arrives, the small zombies randomly attack people without consequences, for example, families do not seek the missing persons. Then comes the wicked Mr. Carlton to the place with the most obnoxious attitudes, a typical cliché that he will eventually die. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr Carlton. When Sarah runs away with her mother and says she's tired and can't run any more, it's one of the most stupid lines I've ever seen in a horror movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
