This movie has some fine special effects that tear the Japanese archipelago to a degree that would humiliate Godzilla. The two leaders also put in over-pair performances. Apart from that, it's all a little ropey in this underrated catastrophe girl. The irregularities in the pacing are bizarre. At one point we have Hokkaido descending into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried under a huge tsunami. But elsewhere in the country people are still jumping around sightseeing and licking ice when another tsunami rolls in. Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance or even a curl in his cream shirt. Other people come up with burns, ripped clothes and mud lines on their faces. <br /> <br /> Japanese film in the movie is both moving and contradictory. Kusanagi's sacrifice in his last night with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry, rarely seen in this genre these days. However, the bad mothers of the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death mumble, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by all and has no friends in the end, is hinted at a darker paranoia that infects Japanese concerns about their status in the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the last sequence is a rip-off of Armaggedon, edited with a cookie cutter. Finally, my own special bug-bear - the heavy hand product placement for cigarettes. This time it is sour (scientist Toyokawa) who becomes the poster girl for Japan Tobacco. At one point, he manages to light up 5000 meters below the sea level, in a miniature below a phone book size. Gimme a break.
