If good intentions were enough to produce a good movie, I would have rated the hilarious, eerie, obvious "Focus" a little higher than 4. Macy does his best, but as a previous poster commented, Miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often. Perhaps the short story gives us a little more background on Newman, so we can understand how a person, of course, who is not without intelligence, could be so close to perceiving the attitudes of those around him. I agree with another reviewer that if you are not aware of how large average citizens were in America during this period, then this movie may be an eye-opener. I grew up in the nineties, and the "good" pastors in my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic on a commercial beach, whose sign prominently pointed out that no Jews or blacks would be admitted. It is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm, and not just in the south. As late as 1964, I was unable to attend the traditional "father and son banquet" when I was educated from a somewhat racially integrated (but sexually separated) public high school in Baltimore when it was held at a facility that did not grant black . Unfortunately, it was a company owned by a Jewish family. The subject of "Focus" is important and we should never forget, despite the lingering signs of racism in modern America, where the truly contradictory attitudes of the previous generation were. (The "greatest generation"). So maybe this movie is somewhat valuable as opposed to the recent wave of sentimental crap about the sixties from likes like Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. But ultimately, as in "far from heaven", the good intentions of filmmakers are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously ignorant of their social conventions.
