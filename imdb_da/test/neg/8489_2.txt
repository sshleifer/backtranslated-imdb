I liked this movie, not a good one but not the worst ever made. Even though everyone else says it's an o the worst movie ever made, I thought it was okay. There are many immature jokes. It will be fun sometimes but fails. <br /> <br /> The story is OK. However, it may be a little difficult to follow for the younger audience, though. <br /> <br /> The action is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is in most cases a horrible actor. Sometimes it's even ridiculous. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor in here. He is fun when he needs to be, but some of his lines are godly. Oh, and the biggest bad thing about this movie I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he is obsessed with a mask. The voice is horrible. Also, the scenes he is in are so unfunny that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have cut him out and it wouldn't affect the movie at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can live without seeing it here. It is a nice movie to see if you have nothing else to look at. They could certainly have gone without doing the sequel, but it is a decent effort. 4.10
