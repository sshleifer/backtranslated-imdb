Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some really amazing movies have been made by his novels ("The Far From the Madding Crowd", "Tess of D'Urbervilles", "The Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had great hopes on this. Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-ification of "Return of the native" completely destroyed it. The cast was amazing, the photograph excellent, but the manuscript was gloomy and the direction was positively devastating. People went up to people, said lines, went away. An inferior tension developed as Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very handsome) exchanged some meat pressing, but even Clive, a great actor, couldn't save it. It was flooded with the usual Hallmark "romantic" strict background music and pretending the bumpkins who played the show and what could have been dynamite turned out to be terrible. The richness of the above three films was largely absent.
