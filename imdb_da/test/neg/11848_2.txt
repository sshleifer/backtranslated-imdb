I have ... Jurrasic Park got Corman-Ized. As usual, the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs weighing 150 pounds and leaving traces larger than inexplicable science using lasers to keep the dinosaurs in control and poultry wagons that have chickens loose in cages that are large enough for big dogs (I have seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster in a movie. All male actors are imbeciles (thinking that a grizzly can be loose in the desert, constantly dropping things to give the raptor a slight kill) and the female actors all look as though they just came from a modeling shooter to Fredrick's Hollywood. The raptor itself is the worst thing since Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it seems that they had a towel version and a plastic model for "motion" shots. If you want a good movie to sit and pick MST3K style, it's gold. If you want competent filmmaking and good actor ... don't see a Roger Corman movie. Acting gets a 4 out of 10, some of the players at this stage tried. The story gets a 2 out of 10, it sounds like a drunken storytelling has gone bad. Special effects get a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
