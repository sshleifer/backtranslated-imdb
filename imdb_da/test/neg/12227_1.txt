We arrived at the theater late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and 'The Comebacks' was the only movie that had not already started. I had an inkling of how bad a movie it was after reading the short blurb on the ticket counter. The theater was empty when we arrived, and only two others went in before the movie started. Writers and instructors threw all imaginable sports cliches into the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the whole movie. Think of all the football movies that have been made, and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend every year on football, and you realize how mature it is to be parodyed or lampooned. If you add Texas to the mix, you should come up with the sports version of 'Little Miss Sunshine', not a big gab. <br /> <br /> The first movie that came to mind when we left the theater was "Cannot Stop the Music" By comparison, this was "Cannot Stop Music" without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine or Village People . <br /> <br /> If the movie had a single grace note, it was watching the Matthew Lawrence adult up.
