Anyone watching this movie will see that the decision makers were throwing a lot of money on this movie. It's interesting, it's called "The Hole"! The production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole tries to see big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot at. I wonder if this was shot at 35mm, it would look incredible and raise the content somewhat. Many Hollywood movies look great, and that's enough for an audience, regardless of history and content. My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Perhaps Ishimoto's next movie will deliver.
