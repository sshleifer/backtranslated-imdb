Okay, imagine that every state in the United States, no, every country has exactly the same trees that grow and ground foliage. Imagine also that a monkey staircase camp so far away from the beaten path you had to make the first half of the approach by the river has a beautiful tarmac'd, perfectly straight road leading up to it. Imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to assemble a floppy disk, then just drop it into a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you return to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining. This is the world this movie is set in. <br /> <br /> Besides that, it is one of the most clich√©-ridden pieces of excrement, it has been my misfortune to witness for many years. <br /> I liked it. :)
