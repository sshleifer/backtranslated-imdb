I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. Why is it that they are always more white women chosen, then they are black women. each episode is their ever more white women than black. as if to say white women look better than black women. I would like to once see more black women then white. And it's not just your show, it's always so white in many shows. but I would have thought since you as the head of the show that you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. But you are like the rest trying to act as if you are so fair and good. You're just a big fony hypocrite.
