Some good set designs. Good songs, though the other guy said they weren't done with much energy. Bea Arthur was trying her best to do something with the material, had an occasional good one-liner like Mame's friend Vera and helped move the song "Bosom Buddies" together. Apart from that, there is nothing here that is worth your time. Slow pacing, incredibly poor filmography, not very good song (except from Robert Preston), a horrible script, bad acting (except Bea) and a horrible leading actress. Who thought Lucille Ball would be good as the classic, life-loving Mame? Heads over to Warner Bros. was undoubtedly blown when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who had done so well on Broadway, and instead use Ball, which was not as fun as when she was 20 years earlier, could not trade the part "the right road "at all and used a painful croak as an excuse for singing. Although (perhaps because) the film was painful for her to do, and even though she funded it, she's just not Mame. Aunt Mame is such a better movie and the soundtrack of Broadway musical with Lansbury sounds good. For the most part, there is nothing here that is big, engaging or interesting at all. Forget it unless you are a big Lucy fan who thinks she couldn't do anything wrong. Hopefully after seeing this you will realize that she was only human.
