I love basketball and it seemed like an exciting movie. But in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it would be miserable. It was badly acted and much too slow. On top of that, it was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes, breeds, ethnic and other types of slurs introduce a point that illustrates the bigotry that exists. In this movie, there was no meaning of the terrible bigotry, and no one learned from what was said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of a game and a remake of a 1982 movie that treated a 1950's basketball team. Having this movie going on earlier in the day would have made a bit more sense. It didn't translate well into modern times, and the writing was horrible. I don't know how the play was originally written, but I can't believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one made it into television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Don't waste your precious time on this one.
