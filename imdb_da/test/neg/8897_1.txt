My only reason to register this site was the ability to comment on this movie. I felt I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it from me. <br /> <br /> The movie "Baby's Cars" should be just the worst movie I've ever seen. I really think the script might have been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something has happened. What makes it even more strange is that the casting seems to be pretty okay on paper. Add to practice both script and cast fail to deliver. There is too much action, it happens too many things, and you can't wonder why that happens. And then cast, the actors make such a bad effort that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time to hand, I'd say you can see it. If not - not.
