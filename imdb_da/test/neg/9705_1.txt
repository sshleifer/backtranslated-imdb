Sorry to say but was disappointed with the movie. It was very much hasty as I suppose you could understand a movie-length version of Pride & Prejudice would be, and I felt that many of the big scenes were beaten just to get through the story. Since the movie is so hasty, you unfortunately don't really get to know and feel very much for each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this movie is boring. I say it with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through, I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. When I read the book and look at the BBC version, I knew how many scenes would go before I finally could leave the cinema. Sir. Darcy, who he is in this movie, certainly can't act. He also looks too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of the mouth is hasty as he needs to get through the manuscript or something. Where is the structure? Initially, he seems confused with everything. He's just bizarre! It all looks. <br /> <br /> Didn't try to compare to the Colin Firth version, but if you love that version, you'll probably be disappointed anyway. The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress like a ladylike fashion and has not been brought up in a squall. Her dresses show that she may be the poorest farmer in England. I did not agree with a few scenes in the film in the fact that I do not think it would be considered a proper one in the society for men to do such things, honestly Mr Bingley, who has wealth should know better. There are some things that are said to sound too modern for the time this movie is set, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly done, for me he seems like a simpleton, not a sign to suffer and respect. What about the laugh of his !!! I hardly have Wickham's presence, and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a few other characters have no presence at all. Keira did okay, but it's just not the same.
