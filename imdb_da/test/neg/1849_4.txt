INFERNO starts with a pretty impressive to a TVM starscape effect. We are also introduced to a scientist named Heller. Don't you get it? Rather, Hell's, Inferno. So I think someone in the production had some intelligence. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent when TVM develops that intelligence has been discarded throughout history to appeal to an American TVM audience. The story itself is overwhelmed by subplots that contain umpteen stock TVM characters as the hard liberal schoolteacher trying to save a housewife from a criminal life, the doctor who has lost his medical permit, etc. In fact, the story concentrates much more on these characters than the nearby disaster, that all the potential excitement and drama that the scenario could have had soon become a smoker, and being TVM we just know that there will be no downbeat ending <br /> <br /> There's a screen issue I've noticed and that's every time there's an explosion there's a massive fireball that looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible. Look at the scene where the National Guard is in battle with a gang. A soldier burns a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes into a fireball. What a little greaned that doesn't contain more than a few ounces of high explosive can do it! No it can't There is another scene of army engineers jumping up with a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect seen. Can directors note that high explosive is not the same as napalm <br /> <br /> Having said that, I found INFERNO very visible to a TVM, and in no time did I find myself turning it on. It had some potentials and let me repeat the special effects are pretty good considering the budget and it's not so bad a TVM as some people do
