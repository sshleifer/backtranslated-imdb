This movie is really bad. The hero cannot play. You see too much that he learned his walking movements of the heart. And believe me, he goes a lot. In 45 minutes nothing happens. He only goes to places and goes out ..... As if the story was so short that they had to expand it by adding useless and boring scenes "like a suspicious". <br /> <br /> Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lot of "hi" and get "hang on" on the 1st part. <br /> <br /> The blood is orange as Mercurochrome you put on the baby's blisters. And scenes do not follow themselves. A bloody neck on a scene, a clean neck on the following. <br /> <br /> History could have been improved. Yes, I mean what the hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial Arts? Where? Is it martial arts? See how hesitant and slow are the movements !!!!! If you give a kick and receive a battle is called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! The only good point I have found is on battle scenes: They don't play with zoom and fast shift scenes that give you headaches in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are lots of low budget films that are good. One was just to make money. Nothing else.
