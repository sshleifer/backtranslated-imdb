I love how everyone treats this show as it was the next big American sitcom. I looked at five episodes of this abomination, and the only one who came close to a real teacher was the old guy who loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just beautiful people trying to read the lines written by people who never really went into a real classroom. I loved how each episode consisted of the two idiots (the one who was laid and the other who did not) came into a form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she found a sweet quality in the biggest idiot, but eventually was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass. The hot chicken that was there for the special purpose of being hot, and the protagonist and her lukewarm, somehow, moving the almost non-existent plot forward. I loved how almost all the teachers at this show were very young, but I ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . did they look like this? Or did you go to high school where middle-aged people learned about it? It is the high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked any kind of study of what is going on in schools. In public schools, school leaders do not have the power to higher and fire teachers, but school management does, but in all episodes that I saw the protagonist threatened to shoot her teachers. Think back to your history class. . . . . Or think of any history class, have you ever seen an incredibly hot British chick learning an American history class? No. Have you ever seen a teacher's lounge so big that you could actually play basketball? No. <br /> <br /> Teachers could have been a good show if it was actually based on some kind of reality. What makes teaching fun is the stories you get from interacting with students, and the teachers find it fun because they deal with students day in and day out. Overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and I'm sorry I just didn't buy it. The show could have modeled itself on other successful sitcoms and used a single camera format, and it should have centered more on the teacher's relationship with their students and not with each other. It will be a star to try and a star for hot chick (she was really hot). In the end, it was a failed sitcom that would go down in history as a hack attempt to understand a profession. I only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes, then a monstrousness like this never touches the television screen.
