This movie undoubtedly is one of the worst I've seen. It was so boring that I simply couldn't wait for it to end. I talked to my boyfriend about seeing it after this place had good reviews and after even 30 minutes i saw me as saying "your nuts" The landscape was as boring as the movie with anything but driving around in the car and looking at the wind blowing bit of bushes around. The action was not inspiring, and the film was simply a waste of what was a good idea for wasting a dvdr. Guy Pierce should have attached to neighbors who at least he washed his hair. All he did was talk on his phone, but didn't sell anything as a seller. He would have been fired before. His boyfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) should have remained dancing at the bar as she at least looked so warm. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Vincent (those who watched) knew was so annoying with his phone call that any normal person would have driven to his house and hit him a bit at 4 by 2. < br /> <br /> I don't know on this earth what anyone liked about it. I actually want people to see this to suffer the torture I went through.
