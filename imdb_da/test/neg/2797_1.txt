excuse my spelling. This is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed. Think evil death * 1000. The action is horrible, you can see the makeup line on a particular lady's face. There is a lesbian scene that doesn't make sense at all. And the end, haha ​​ohhhh the end ... be prepared to get your stomach hurt by laughter. Now, if you see this movie for more than 5 minutes and still expect something, take a look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a very bad movie that is meant to laugh and enjoy the sheer sadness. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to see all the exits after the movie, you can see how low the budget really is. All in all, this movie is a rare gem in demonstrating the sheer and arduous lack of talent / care / ability / money / and anything else you would ever need to make a successful movie. But it is definitely worth seeing.
