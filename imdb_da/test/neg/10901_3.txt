Young couple on the road, thinking their own business and having relaxed sex in their car in broad daylight. But suddenly they are threatened and terrorized by a forged psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yes, now I remember we've seen this a thousand times before, and about. Nine hundred and ninety-seven of the other cases were much better than "Rest Stop"! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most incredible horror fans, as it does not contain a single original twist or memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and uncomfortable, but every teenkill slasher flick is sadistic and uncomfortable today, so it's no longer a real surprise, either. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of stupid plot holes and meaningless subplots. The author / director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic story was almost not enough to fill an entire movie, thus filling his film as a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material. Nicole's boyfriend disappears at an abandoned and dirty rest stop in California. Killing her character right away would not result in a very long movie, and consequently she meets an engine family of freaks, suffering from visions (?), Talking to the earlier victims of the horrible murderers, and she has deep emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck ran over him ... twice! The stupid subplots never lead anywhere, and they are certainly the most pathetic and desperate attempt to stretch a movie length I've ever seen. Instead of all the meaningless padding, Shiban should have put more emphasis on building tensions and making his protagonists a little more sympathetic. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and mindless girl and you will not really worry about whether or not she will survive the test. Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the policeman are both whining losers, and their brutal deaths were still not painful enough if you ask me. I figured out exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, which was gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile to my face. It's still too few a horror movie today. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a miserable attempt to deposit the success of such films as "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but you are better off seeing the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They are emerging as the new name in great horror, but they have to come up with something much better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
