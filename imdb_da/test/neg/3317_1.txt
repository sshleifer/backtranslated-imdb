Now don't get me wrong, I love to see half naked chicks waving around. It's part of fun at a Moroccan restaurant: ogling the belly dancers. But that doesn't make much of a plot. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is the music. I have the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", Cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though I could be wrong). I know if the current "goth" music could have seemed like a good idea, but they did a terrible job with it. Lestat was an actor with probably a pretty good song voice. That they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Other, and another said, mashing two very intricate books into a crappy movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could have been a movie in itself, and a marvelous good if it's done right. I honestly don't think "The Queen of the Damned" makes a movie very well. Although I would love to see a movie incorporating a creation story, there is too much to say inactivity in the book because it is a very interesting movie. And the narrative made them dirty it pretty bad. Now you've been thinking it's been a long time since I read it, I've always thought "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more action-packed and would have made better movies . /> <br /> I know many people (hello, even included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap who thought it was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a big movie. I usually agree with them there. Aaliyah, however, had a good body.
