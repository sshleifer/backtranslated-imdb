I am usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" movies, but when I saw this, my reaction was "it must be called experimentally because it doesn't make sense". The "action" is static while jumping from one place to another. There are not enough titles to make clear who is who and what their relationship is. Apparently, the main point was to show that in the case of murder, adultery and generally weird and dissolved behavior, the cure offered by the powers is to ban a completely innocent black man.
