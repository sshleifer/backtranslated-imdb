Well, of course, everyone has the right to have an opinion about something ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, the year 1968, the students manifestations, general strike, youth, ideals, love ..... etc. Sorry, but I didn't feel love, romance. A lover who is okay that his girlfriend sleeps no matter who? It is love? But not only that, the film is very long, and I didn't have to stop watching the movie several times because I just lost interest. I waited for something to happen, but nothing. The only thing I was impressed with was the Gypsy fiddler playing on the streets, yes it was great. I don't think art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Big disappointment and a waste of time!
