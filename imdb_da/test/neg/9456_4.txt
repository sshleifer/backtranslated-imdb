Ouch!! What a mess we have here. Not so much of a mess as a painfully boring, half-apologetic excuse for exploitation. Brought to you by one and only, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same from Moonshine Mountain. Doctor Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is, in my opinion, a little inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The late Mr Patterson is also the star of this joke, as a heart-failing researcher / plastic surgeon who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and is insane to grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless women, so maybe rob some graves for body parts to "put together" the perfect buddy. It will not be easy, but thanks and goodness, his comrade Gregg, the hunchback is available to lend a hand and to offer moral support. If it was ever necessary to prove that some people's goals are not meant to be done, here's the gang. This Patterson Hayseed, of course, never had any company that led anything, much less, in the footsteps of the good ol H. G. as a master for gore. I have never seen a gore movie that just flat-out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to watch. Even gore is boring. Almost extremely humorous at times, but impossible to tell whether it is intentional or not. I do not choose. <br /> <br /> Shots in Charolotte, North Carolina (home of California Axacassacre), probably a 3-digit budget, by a guy as unlikely as he may have had likely appreciated waste collection, so maybe we should give it a good, JG a break I mean he tried (I suppose), which is more that can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the big budget superhero waste theaters laid out These days, though, I realize it doesn't say much. In addition, Dr. Gore is quite upset about Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it's a little possible that he would have improved his craft in time if he wasn't dead, so maybe it's not that terrible, especially in relation to it another movie on the DVD, how to make a doll, so what the hell, check it out. 4.10
