In the ring there was a videotape; One site was the problem in Feardotcom; The danger in Pulse came from computers; and phone and a missed call featured ?? you guessed it ?? deadly phones. In Stay Alive, the piece of technology that causes all kinds of problems, is an online game: those who play it quickly come to death shortly after. How smart! <br /> <br /> Directed by William Brent Bell (who?) And with an unimpressive cast of twenty somethings that you may have seen before but probably can't remember where or what the hell their names are, this is a extremely derived piece of film-making directed entirely to the PG-13 horror set; Crossing scary movie guards will no doubt find Stay Alive extremely boring, very predictable and not at least scary. The poorly developed plot follows a group of players with extremely stupid names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch and Swink!?!), Trying to dig up the mystery behind the deadly game before they also become victims. Eventually, they discover that it is the evil spirit of legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory who kills anyone who dares to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue the game to the end. <br /> <br /> With a story as stupid as this, viewers should expect a loose-end movie and not a logical logic (who made the game, how and why is it never explained), very little in the way of scare or do and a stupid closed scene to leave the door open to God forbid a successor.
