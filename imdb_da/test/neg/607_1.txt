I can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. It's as if they didn't even bother trying to write good comedy, just rehash the third rate jokes and hope it sticks. The worst of all is that it is all so uninteresting and lacking in every way. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, Kevin James has a permanent "I'm so funny" sneak grin on his face that would be tolerable if he only delivered once in the comedy department he didn't do, he Just lie there, do nothing like a big unfunny baby. Which brings me to the relationship between the Heffernans - it's easily the most eerie and bad representation of a couple on any TV show, really headache-inducing unpleasant Remini spends the whole show as if it were a violent task to be around her own husband . Jerry Stiller yanking the few laughs on the show makes a 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld only this time his hints mostly go on water due to the inability of the central duo to recognize a joke even though it flew by them . The episodes just go together in a stream of nothing, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, this is a ridiculous creative desert.
