The concept of this movie is unique, but its performance is less than special. When I got to the cinema and realized that there were only about 15 people or so in the crowd, I thought I had made a mistake. But the real mistake was made in shocking details when the movie is finished and I knew I had been wasting two hours in my life. Without the old footage of the old and the stupid funny girlfriend, this movie would have rated 1 out of ten. <br /> <br /> This movie is special, special because it is probably the worst movie ever released to the public. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of whether you could call it a movie or just an ad to the probably crummy "Northwestern". <br /> <br /> If you're thinking of watching this movie for the plot, humor, the movie, places, then don't do it. On the other hand, if you like to experience both ends of the film production spectrum, just take a book or a small game or just a novelty.
