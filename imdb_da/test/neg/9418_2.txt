When you see Barry Corbin in the movie of a movie, you can never be sure it will be a classic or a garbage can. Guess which category SOLO falls into. Apparently, from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO, Mario Van Peebles comes as a human-like robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted at elimination. He hides in a Mexican village, of course, to save money on places and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suppose. William Sadler is together for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles manages to beat them all with ease, of course, while Corbin sees all of this with bemusement far from it. The movie is a horrible ripoff of THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series, and apparently has little to do with its source material. It is terribly written and acted, and the great battle at the end, if it is even comical. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic meat. He looks like he's doing Robot Dance most of the time.
