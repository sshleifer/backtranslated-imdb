During a lifetime of watching and enjoying thousands of movies, Feeling Minnesota is definitely the worst (** big movie with A-list stars) that I've ever seen. Bar none. This movie fails completely at all levels. It is poorly photographed and edited. There are uninspired plays, the kind in which the actors look bored out of their minds. Just collect paychecks, maybe? And worst of all, it seems sludgy script to be written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in sewers. I can't even begin to understand how the author / director could ever have found someone to fund this project, let alone attract any of the stars it did. I really wish I could get back the time I wasted and then look at this piece of waste. If possible, I would have given this movie a zero class. Even better, a negative number.
