For the first time in reviewing movies, I immediately found myself uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused and totally unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes I found myself quite apathetic with all the characters and history. I felt that I had seen this structure before, and Tart did not deliver anything new to surprise me. After thinking that it might just be my mood, I stopped the movie and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling continued. I just didn't care. It's not a good sign. The signs were bland. When I say bland, I literally mean that by seeing them develop, you will never have any taste hit your palate. The story seemed to be reused, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she didn't add anything new to the perspective. The casting was horrible, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (or the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. You didn't know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we found ourselves with drugs, less sex and money pushed into our faces. These are themes we've seen in each movie since the start of the movie, but somehow we couldn't creatively capture it by Wayne. <br /> <br /> What immediately took me away from this story? It was mostly the signs. I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work and he must honestly redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined him, and strangely, he can't get out of the stereotype. Within the first twenty minutes of Renfros screen time, I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular or impressive, just repetitive. He had to bring some excitement or excitement to his role, rather than just gently playing this random socialite. Without a strong character, the last climax of this movie comes as a downturn. Renfro did not show the best of his abilities in this movie. While I'm in the subject ?? no one exhibited the best of their abilities. What happens to Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I don't think she really emerged as an actress, and follow-up with roles like Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I experienced, actually trying to bring something remarkable on the screen, unfortunately because of everyone's horrid action, she was lost. Rambling here and there, and honestly almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast, and most of this movie budget probably went to her two scenes she was in. Perhaps the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem outside the play was the pacing of this movie. Nothing, and it's hard for me to say, but nothing sounds together. There were so many sub-stories during the film that no real substance was formed. The robbers, the teenager "anxiety and woe", the wealthy socialites who learn how terrible the reality is, the random Kids in the Hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and terribly edited together. With this foamed craft, the whole story never formed any true form. Family structures were never defined, characters were never given any sense, and all we are left with is bits and pieces of honest remnants. Wayne did not complete the task at hand. <br /> <br /> While I hate to put the whole burden on the director, with this movie, I'm back with little choice. With a horrible title that just screamed the opposite of what this film was about, it was with amorphous directional ability to give all the feelings in all scenes and left us vile actions and bad developments, and with vague storytelling it is difficult to place anything "good" behind Tart. This was a movie I hadn't heard of and after seeing it I can see why. Everything Wayne has done with this movie is randomly taking excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all of the above elements and cutting together to make movie Tart. It's hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this movie. Though I didn't think there was much to take in the story, there were remaining elements of excitement drained when Wayne took the helm. While you can mostly credit some of the story, perhaps strong plays, or even the music, in Tart you can't credit anything. From the opening sequence to the end, I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal. No consistency, no strength. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a waste of your time. If you are looking for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some deeds in our society, you won't find it in this movie. While I know, what Wayne was trying to show was the final product as if it were edited on an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing movie to sit through and encourage no one to pick it up. Wayne threw to the wind all the lessons in his Columbia University education and destroyed two hours in my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Degree: * out of *****
