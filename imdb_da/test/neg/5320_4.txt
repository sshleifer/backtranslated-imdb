I had seen this on Italian television as a kid and remember being happy about it - given the mixed live animation action; However, it was universally panned at that time ... and to catch up again after all these years, I must admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What must have been wonderful for a child's eyes is actually very badly done, not to mention boring for a fantasy adventure; badly both star (ex-angry young man Richard Harris) and instructor (action expert hunt) unfit for the material! At least Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics from scriptwriter Don Black) is used - if not exactly inspired. That way, there are a number of well-known personalities among the speech musicians of this British-Belgian co-production (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and, as is his last film work, Michael Bates). While the essential plot points in Jonathan Swift's classic novel ('giant' Gulliver becomes the peasant in a war between the small people of two neighboring countries and, when they come out, end up in a land of real giants) come up here, it's done strictly kiddie level (with stereotypical characters, but luckily a little bit of comic / romantic variety) - making the whole venture somewhat useless beyond its real experimental character, when Max and Dave Fleischer had already made a nice cartoon version of the book right back in 1939!
