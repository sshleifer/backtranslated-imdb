A travel couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumbled on the town of Gatlin, where the children have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more while they are separated and Peter Horton of course has to save his wife from these tedious horrible thugs in this very poor adaptation of one of the king's best short stories. In the original story, King managed to create tensions and draw personality from his characters, but all that has been zapped from production and all that remains is a repetition that is too predictable to be so exciting. Also, the effective ending used in history is too dumped for a good ending, making the overall effect dumb. There is some atmosphere and stylish direction, but no plot to back any of it. The kids are sadly convincing too. <br/> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
