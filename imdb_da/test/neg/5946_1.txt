People! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents ask him to kill them because they go senile and will be knocked out of their misery. Several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind and saves them from his death traps at the last minute and loses one of his body parts each time in the process. The movie seems to hate the protagonist, making it even more painful to watch. There is also the usual urgent love interest and predictable ending. <br /> <br /> This movie was also the first time I saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember his shaved upper lip looking strange and making me feel a bit slick. But this could have been just because of the movie's horrible premise and lame performance.
