According to the blurb at the back of the DVD case; Jonothan Ross 'grinning until a little whip came out'. I suspect it has more to do with being filled with it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the series for some reason, so maybe I'm missing some important signals. With regard to this film; I saw the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once and reached the newspaper and waited for something entertaining to happen. Nothing did. <br /> <br /> It was obviously a surrealistic spoof on life in post-Python, gross humor style, this is falling flat. There have been a number of comedy series on TV in the last few years, not least of which "Bottom", "The Fast Show" "Vicar Of Dibley" and "Father Ted", each with a group of bizarre but fun characters and sketches. Any of these could knock this crap in a tense hat. <br /> <br /> If the series was something like this movie; I'm surprised they got the funding. Fortunately, it was one of the 2 Â£ Tesco fire-tube purchases and is now in the local charity shop. The story is moral; Don't think the pounds, never pay the top dollar.
