*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie I have just been exposed to the stars you. The problem is far and wide and painful for me to tell. . . nevertheless, I feel that I must, if only to prevent others from suffering the same anxiety as I did. This is not a movie for anyone under the age of 50, it is soooooooo slow, and when the great reunion of Ada and Inman takes place. . .The biggest and most important scene in the movie, nothing happens, it's an epic letdown. Now, as the director should have done, I will keep my words short and end with this warning, your movie is uneven, boring, has no power, and Jude Law is tragically mistaken, he showed more emotion as a robot in the A.I. - be warned, the movie must resume. . Bored Mountain. Love, Ada
