I have to admit I'm disappointed after watching this movie. I had expected so much more from trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It lacked a real story line and the play wasn't exactly the best. Do not waste your time. The movie is not what trailers lead you to believe it is. I have to say that I usually do not write about movies on IMDb (actually it is my first), but this movie was such a disappointment that I just registered to let people know that they are not wasting their time or money. The storyline is the one of a hoist that has to happen, and it seems that it had the potential to be good, but the things that happen in the movie are a bit far-fetched to be credible. Watch another movie instead, maybe the inner man ???
