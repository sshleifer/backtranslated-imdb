I was very disappointed with this movie. Twice I had to go out because segments of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film has elements that highlight all the nitty-gritty things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, adultery, hatred, warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher makes a big misunderstanding to the LDS Church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lacking. /> <br /> My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the opposite of an emotional movie. Holland's God Army One was okay. His Brigham City was pretty good. This casting, acting and drama movie was his best. But in terms of being inspiring or uplifting, it was as terrible as it could be. In fact, this film demoralized that I regret I went. I have lost interest in ever supporting Dutcher in an LDS theme movie ticket ticket.
