Edge Vs. Michaels-drilling in general (loved the sweet garden music in the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst battles I have seen, predictable as hell 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE match-Why do I see them, no one ever wins a championship in the room, this is not the main event. Like it when Show ran the JBL through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship-Pretty OK match, a little more a beat-down of Tripe H than a fight, but I was happy to see it after seeing the crap. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, Similar fire showdown, Hassan stuff, and the end. 7/10 All in all, still crap. Why does anyone see the room ???
