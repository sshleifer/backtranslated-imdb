I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie as bad as this. Terrible action, Everywhere plot, terrible special effects. There are some 'so bad ones good' moments here, but not really enough to maintain interest. The woman playing Tracey looks horrible. There are some rather disturbing scenes with a dwarf that gives you the feeling that you're ever so slightly offended. On the plus side, the operating scenes are entertaining for the special effects, as it is the car watch, where a car "tries to force us away from the road" without getting in touch. Guess the budget does not extend to waste trucks. Oh, and what looks like a postcard of the Taj Mahal is shown every time they cut into the fictional foreign land.
