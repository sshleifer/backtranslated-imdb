I wish it was "Last Dumb Thriller". But thrillers are like that. They are like children: many, illogical and often annoying. They want so desperately to be taken seriously, but what is there to take seriously about a child's behavior or a thriller's plot? Having seen this particular kid - I mean ... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as "a hitchcockian thriller"; they might as well have called it "idiotic" because that's what "hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (look it up if you don't believe me). Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood, which is a mistake: it doesn't fit a late 70's movie and makes it look fake. Also, how dare they steal De Palma's idea of ​​stealing from Hitchcock?! The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed and her killers are never a problem. Instead, his former employers first follow him around, and later he decides to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Maybe because the FBI is a dark, dark organization ("X-Files") that is very trigger-happy to beat its former employees of the pension funds. Or maybe because it is fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting seer tries to figure out the mystery by logically assuming there is a great conspiracy, the killer is really ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman occupies Scheider's living quarters; The one who briefly suggested she was "depraved". Why does she go after Scheider at a time when his wife was murdered and he feels paranoid - and followed by his own former employers - and not a few years earlier or a few years after the wife's murder? A pure hitchcock (look it up again in the dictionary if you have forgotten what that means) chance. And what about the brilliant motif of her ...! Her grandmother was forced to prostitution when she was a 15-year-old virgin in New York, and then syphilised by a bunch of horned Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheider's grandfather As a result, Margolin has played a hook in her spare time to kill all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilized her disposable grandmother. How does hitchcockian (see it up) is it? The final shamelessly changes from the Mount Rushmore scene from "North By Northwest", except that love interest is a killer, and she is not rescued. <br /> <br /> The movie also gives some dubious -writing dialogue and some not so much acting. Check out the stupid and obvious way Napier follows Scheider in the cemetery. Let's also forget Napier's moronic plot unit that reached its jacket and kept its hand very suspicious - but it wasn't a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the Tower: Now there is another severe illogical behavioral pattern. J. Demme was, is, and will always be, a styleless instructor without flair and the man who instructed "Philadelphia". Let's give him another Oscar!
