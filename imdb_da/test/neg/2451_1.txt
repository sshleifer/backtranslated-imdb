I think I'd rather have my piles cut with a few rusty rocks than wearing another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact, I can't even be bothered to go into details! Not sure how they managed to get the needles into the wood actors to cure them! Better for everyone worried if they had just embraced the island after finding out about the virus, that way it would have lasted as long as the commercial break and we could move on with our lives. Another thing was this nonsense ordered by the god channel? As all they seemed to do, praise the gentle gentleman most of the time. Avoid like the plague! In fact, I would prefer it!
