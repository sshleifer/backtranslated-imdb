I have great respect for Mr Argento's work, but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films truly unique. The opening to the movie is amazing and sets you up for the possibility of a really scary horror movie. What happens to the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build much. However, there are some good performances and a lot of good atmosphere. The end of the movie is weak considering all that builds on. Where there should be some big climax of large proportions, instead you get a very typical conclusion that for many other bad horror movies use, so it feels like they just need to pack it up. A few scenes are very memorable for their imaging, but ultimately the movie doesn't look like making a really good movie. Unless you feel you need to see everything this instructor did, I suggest passing on this one ...
