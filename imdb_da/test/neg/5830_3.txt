Final Draft - A scriptwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks into his apartment and gives in to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. Not a terrible assumption, but the performance is horrible. It feels like a first year's direction and writing jobs, and that's enough. The director jumps into hell out of everything. It is supposed to be disorienting. What it is is annoying. So much so that small pieces of film are incoherent. The script is predictable and does not use to follow through on most ideas it offers (bag of oranges). It's as if they ran out of time and slaped it together at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is not stupid "Oh my god, it's so bad, it's good" bad. It is boringly bad and irritates you for a long time afterwards. James Van Der Beek is not a horrible actor and keeps the ship a little over the water. But he is too normal for the kind of psychosis that the film is trying to offer. He is just a retreat guy who one day sees people and hallucinating things, so he decides to act mildly confused. Reason follows effect. Maybe there's something in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a horrible actor. He shares the parable of Chris O'Donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman performance. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere the movie gives is good (dull gray and gloomy), but since that is the only thing the movie achieves it means nothing. This movie will be Jacob's Ladder or Machinist. It's not even a secret window. It's the preppy girl in the class who decides to turn the goth. <br /> <br /> Not scary, but the sheer stupidity of it will scare you. I've already thought more about this criticism than the filmmakers did for this. <br /> <br /> D
