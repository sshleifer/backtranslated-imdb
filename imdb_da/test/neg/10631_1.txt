After enduring this movie last night, I knocked off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal to get the endurance to see it through to the end. Throughout the movie I felt like I was watching the movie files that you get in a high budget porn movie. the actor was stiff and tight, the camera was terrible, and the locations and sets were so poor, they felt like they had borrowed them from the local gym "Amateur Dramatic Society". The only saving grace to this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in their credits, except that it was pure dribble.
