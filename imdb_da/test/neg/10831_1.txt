when i first saw this movie, i literally rolled around on the floor laughing (especially when they were chased by the water and when the guy drove through people's gardens, i think it would be bad to drive around the wash basin?) the special effects ! This movie obviously did not have a big budget. either that or the guy left his young child in charge of the control. The water that came out of the foreground looked like a close to a beer container that had confused itself. what did the actors think? Did they actually think it was a good movie? Or did they really need the money? Not that they would have earned much. When I first saw this, I was like 'God, how old is this?' When I looked at the information about it and saw that it was made in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. This is really a disaster movie in more ways than one.
