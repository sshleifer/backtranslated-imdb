I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every episode of South Park (if they don't show them and then mention them) and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves, but I felt this mockumentary went too far. <br /> <br /> First, the most common ongoing theme in the "documentary" is that they are episodes, meaningless pieces of crap, they have only put up for the money. Clearly, if you even disturb to see any episode, it is completely uncertain, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." is set at the end of almost every episode of the protagonists. The creators are also depicted as pompous, arrogant donkeys who only care about money, including a presumably fun but not a scene with Isaac Hayes, who supplies lines to Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker shouts and screams at him for to suck and hang up. I guess it should be fun, but the regret in it just made it right ... cringe. How they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants pushing their employees to the border, all for the money, in the end. Absolutely untrue, of course and everyone a joke, but it's just not fun. It's disturbing, even if it's just a joke.
