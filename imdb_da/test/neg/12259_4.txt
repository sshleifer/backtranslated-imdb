Being a fan of ZaSu Pitt's comedies, I thought it looked like it was worth a try. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM, but consisted only of Niagara Falls movies; the Miss Polly movie was absent.) The actors' talents, giving good performances, are wasted on one of The stupid stories I've ever had the accident through. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show, but the spotlight is beaten by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer) who, if he has any talent, did not demonstrate this. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great, but not nearly big enough. The biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under Sam under a table. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie that makes any sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is unfair in general. While she is physically quite attractive, her personality and attitude makes her completely undesirable. Elly, Sam and the hotel receptionist are just finished fools. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly give up their honeymoon in the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam ends up catching Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the movie is the ones trying to break out, but Sam, using a rifle, always puts them back. <br /> <br /> Towards the end comes the worst part. Tom, who is finally making good of his escape, runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel. Now the guy, who, as I said, is the only one in the whole movie who has his head on his shoulders, suddenly, for absolutely no reason, decides to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> He pulls the minister up to the room he just fled from, but Margie won't marry him. He gives her a kiss, and now after a kiss, she feels compelled to marry him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sam nerve has to say to Tom, "you cheat me" when it is almost the only line Tom had to be Sam before, "We're not married", as Sam replied: "You think I believe in it?" <br /> <br /> Idiotic.
