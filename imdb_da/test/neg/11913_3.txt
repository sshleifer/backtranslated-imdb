I'm not a fan of the Monogram Chan movies. . The reason, which involves radium theft from a bank vault, is a bit far-fetched and far from the atmospheric mysteries that Fox produced. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (as No. 3 son Tommy) are laughing as normal. But otherwise there is not much here. Great title that is wasted.
