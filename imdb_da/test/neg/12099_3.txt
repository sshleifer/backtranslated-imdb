Cheesy 80's horror co-starring genre favs Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash along with Brenda Bakke are some of the featured players in this tale of a haunted health club. The train dialogue and some ugly effects make this movie appear. Not bad, but not much shakes. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogue and action. Only B-movie fans. <br /> <br /> B
