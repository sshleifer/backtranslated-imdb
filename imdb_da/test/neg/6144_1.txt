What exactly is to pretend to "con" people out of things like ski slopes and pizza? I fail to see a point. I would not be wise or original, and it seems to me extremely pointless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone doesn't seem to be a very down to earth or even a good guy. He has very little charisma and almost anyone could do what he does in this show. <br /> <br /> The worse thing about this piece of shit is the fact that many of the phone calls are being reenacted, so it is not only the poor people who come across the other end of the phone, but they are also related to the audience who Don't have enough time to read the "redundant" that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the start of the show! <br /> <br /> Not only that, but he also claims that this is how he lives all his life. What a lie. No one could live their lives like this, and the fact that he says this is not just another chance to show his show, but it is also one of the most produced, blatant pieces of bull $ hit I ever heard. This guy is a @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think about going to all the trouble of writing and recording a song for example. Does anyone get a big picture of you and two friends, get dancing lessons and actually travel to a ski is really worth getting free ski cassettes and some free food? What's the point? It's a terrible lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski slopes and a bit of snow. <br /> <br /> As far as "comedy" goes, this is the bottom of the barrel stuff.
