It is literally the three stooges again, without the charm. This show is no more than the worst slapstick. I'm surprised they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random and 'controversial' for no other point than trying very (very) hard to be controversial. And people think this is 'brave'? Get a clue: This show takes absolutely no thought, time, effort, money or creativity / originality to produce. Any references present are aimed at anyone aged 6 and 16 who would occasionally review People magazine. But I suppose that's just what all kiddies want, just like and need today.
