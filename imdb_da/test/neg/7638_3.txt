I'm sorry people, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "Respiro" are very strange, to say the least. Is brilliance quaint, I ask and did not find an answer. Of course, the film is beautifully filmed, and it is almost a documentary film. But then the fact is that when it comes to the women Grazia, she shows every sign of a deep illness, and I wondered throughout the film about what she's got. Her behavior is quite worrying, and the village's (shocked) citizens are right in wanting to send her to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition. She needs treatment as soon as possible! Behavior as her is inferno to everyone around her, her husband, the poor children (especially) and the citizens. Let's not be wrong romantic about this! I hated this confronting portrait of a mentally ill. Why should the god's fault not be hardened or at least try to do it for God's sake? Why the fear of going to Milan (a big city, safe, but plenty of opportunities for talented people to heal her)? Bigotry? Irresponsibility? Still, I inspired myself on this site to rent the movie on DVD, and after seeing it, I had to send it to others to get their opinion on it. Frankly, I understand why the movie didn't get further as INDICATION for the Cannes selection ...
