What movie is this ??? A horrible movie with the old boring infidelity already achieved by the Bhatt camp. The film starr EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The movie has "No Base". It just goes like that ... Dino a Udita is married and lives in a rich manor. But Dino doesn't like Udita to heart, as he only wants her wealth. He loves another (Tara Sharma). So he bribes Emraan to have an affair with Udita so he could catch them and finally split up with Udita .. How to live !! Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita is imprisoned for killing Emraan, Dino tries pretentiously to save her, showing her false love for her. Udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he really loved her. Then she gives all her wealth to Dino. Finally, Dino comes out of the police station and joins Tara with all wealth. What a scam !! The songs are good and are the only good thing in the movie. Now, the individual ratings: (out of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 Overall acting: * 1/2 Direction: * * History: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Bad performances and bad casting ....... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Don't waste your time !!!!)
