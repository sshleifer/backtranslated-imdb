The BBC and the Arts and Entertainment Network were to be ashamed of themselves in order to evoke this unfortunate production on the world. The action, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, is at best amateur and scary at worst. The costumes are over-the-top and have some really ghoulish overruns - was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Surely every woman in Bath did not have feathers in her head in the early 19th century. The production values ​​are poor and the pacing of the film makes it feel like it was quickly and clumsily edited at the last minute. All in all, a disturbing movie that I had to force myself to look to the end. It's a shame as the producers of course spent a lot of money on costumes and location sources. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime "Sense and Sensibility" or the extraordinary 1995 production of "Pride and Prejudice" or the subtle intensity of 1995's "Persuasion", this production of "Northanger Abbey" surely has Jane Austen in his tomb.
