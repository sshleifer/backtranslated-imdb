Experienced professionals live up to an exotic and dangerous location. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They lose pigs in parachutes. They fly under impossible dangerous conditions. They dress strangely and act breathlessly. They are iconoclastic, monstrous. They violate any command control and have contempt for their employers at the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It is not "only angels have wings" and it is not "M * A * S * H." It's a troubled mix of the two, which unfortunately comes across as more stupid than fun. <br /> <br /> But it does aim at shock, entertainment and education, but really does not achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> As far as its shock value is concerned, we're good now, aren't we? Is it really shocking to anyone that a bunch of live pilots flew secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not shocking. It is not even educational now, under the current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursions were NOT buried in a file called National Interest, Defense de Toucher. It is okay. So we have suffered a bit and are no longer so shocking or stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the film relies on the very qualities that are for its power to entertain. Without it, the film begins. A group of shaggy drunk CIA pilots sit in a cat house, go out with the girls, shoot the lights out with a silent gun and kill the lizards with the same. Ask newbie pilot Robert Downey, jr. "When you look like this, it means there's something to celebrate?" Answer another, guffawing, "No, that means it's night time." It might be fun if we expect deviant pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. If we don't, gag, like the movie, falls flat. <br /> <br /> There are natural scenes. Anything that may be happening in or on an airplane in flight takes place in or on a flight in flight. People fall out of them, luggage is accidentally thrown out of their hats, engines fail, they maintain damage from AAA, they torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better. <br /> <br /> Some may find this more fun than I did, and the play is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the right man. Check out the other comments and if they describe a movie that you might find appealing, then see it at all. There may be some laughs in what escaped me.
