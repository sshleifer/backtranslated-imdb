This overheated South Gothic "Mellerdramer" has a few decent moments - but is too often spoiled by a novice director who claps the cliché on cliché and a star who apparently decided to take it upon herself to make the picture her personal show. rather than letting author / director Gabel update Inge or Williams as a kind of modern "Midnight Cowboy", "Lolita" meets tearjerks. Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accents, and try to determine if you 'are witnessing a feature film or a acting class - full of keen amateurs. <br /> <br /> Johansson is once tolerable (ie less pouty than usual) - but in no way good is Macht decent, though a little too beautiful boy sweet to be believed, and Travolta German nature never before (using a decent editor and some directional restraint, his performance could have been really touching; as he is - and almost everyone else - too unlikely to ever move beyond boredom or disgust). Kara Unger is perhaps best of all; Had her role been developed beyond a few lines, she could even have found herself with a nomination for best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> The Pic is almost rescued by Leonard Cohen style, cruel theme song, decent production design and rankings, and continuous reference to literary works (which have earned the otherwise standardized manuscript reviews as "poetic".) Also helpful are some get old benefits in cast as Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, Soderbergh cameraman Elliot Davis - whose fine work will undoubtedly be credited to the first-time instructor, who can actually learn how to lead in ten or twenty years. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
