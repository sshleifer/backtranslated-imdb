I found this to be a hugely disappointing version of a charming story. I thought the play was pretty good at all. Reginald Owen chewed nature, as mentioned by others, but I found him moderately entertaining in his short scenes. TCM has made an Ann Harding fan of me and I thought she was good as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day like the old battleaxe and ordered everyone around, and Frank Morgan always played Frank Morgan with a twinkle. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or editing - Transitions were awkward, motivations were scary. The movie was just too darned to convey the story properly! I felt completely worn, especially since I had such good memories of the later version.
