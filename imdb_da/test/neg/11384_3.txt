To start this movie was sick. Here your wife dies and you walk around the city with this blonde chic by your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are with this smart. Hank (James Brolin) certainly goes fast in this film. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady, and before you know it, she has sex with her best friends. The part that gets me is when she "does it" in the barn with Kevin and gets caught by another of Hank's friends. Kevin gets up and leaves, she releases her dress and BAM !! Right into this other guy's arms, and they are starting to "do it" just as and then. I guess he's finished what Kevin started. WHERE GROSS !!!! I'm like this is lifetime movie ??? It's a typical OLD MAN YOUNG WOMAN movie that says you can get my body if I get your money ...
