If he just hadn't bowed to clich√©, Mr Shiban could actually have made a good movie from this story. It was just different enough to keep you interested, so at the same time, energy and money as it was spent on this stink, we could have had something good instead of eye scrolling. <br /> <br /> Production wise, it's as good as one could really expect from a handheld camcorder so he gets good brands there. It really is the script that is due to the play not being so bad either, considering what the actors had to work with. <br /> <br /> I thought the days had long gone since we wanted to see someone, find a radio transceiver they desperately want to operate, first turn every knob on the case from end to end, bash it at the top 6 or 7 times and then expect it to work. This story is ruined by a continuous string of stupid movements of all the characters except the bad guy. It is as if we are meant to be too superficial to understand all the plot units, so they are all cut to us to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, but it doesn't work on me. My attention ends with being obsessed with plot holes and overdramatization, not history. So when I found this not to be so bad in the technical sense, I think Mr. Shiban would try again, only with a proper script next time; then he can give us something worth looking at.
