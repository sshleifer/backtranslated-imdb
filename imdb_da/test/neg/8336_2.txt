An awful mish mash of predictable story lines and foolishly poorly delivered PC clich√©s ad nauseam (races work together, the heroine is also smart, a guy sacrifices to save another life, a father / daughter relationship, etc.). The movie looks like something created for network TV and should probably be there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones is unable to save this BOMB. I urge not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time of the disaster films wandering Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The two stars are exclusively given to the CGI people and the ability of PR people to get just a movie-goer through it.
