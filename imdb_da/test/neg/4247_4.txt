Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid I won't. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn off mid-movie because of the rejection. Too much time is spent on unwanted and emotional bedlam, and the point of the Bullock character is being destroyed by her divorce at all in the viewer's head. Now it's enough !! And why didn't we hear more about her former husband? He is portrayed as nothing but a suit that comes once in a while. Some of it has made her want to marry him, what was that? What is it about him that makes her so devastated by their divorce? More time could have been spent on it rather than another extra shot of Bullock lying curly on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is set, clich√© and awful, like one of those corny "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something. There is no imagination or creativity about anything in this movie, it is all very predictable and therefore boring. This movie also goes into exaggeration on the cutsiness factor, very stupid and not fun as it should be! This is just another of those terribly done "I'm a woman, hear me roar" movie, like "Waiting to pull out". If you want to see "I'm a woman, hear me roar" movies that are really entertaining, original and well done, see "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this scream !! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
