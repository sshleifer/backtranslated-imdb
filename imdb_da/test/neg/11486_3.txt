After the film's history, there have been a few films that deceive the viewer, such as hitchcock's "scene fright", alejandro amen√°bar's "abre los ojos", David Fincher's "game" and this "ausentes" ("absent"). To begin with, I don't like this kind of movie, I want someone trying to pull my leg. <br /> <br /> Also, having seen this movie, you do not know what happened is such a confusing movie. Kubrick's "shining" can be a better or a worse movie, but it is quite frank than this burden of pretentious and dubious situations. Technically, it's fine photography, fair performance and so on, but the script is so poor, I wonder what the producers are looking to continue and shoot this crap. <br /> <br /> and this movie notes the 3 guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) lost in the cinema trying to make a masterpiece - or trying to do something to fulfill their stomach, waiting for more personal projects.
