This film is very violent, yet exciting with original dialogue and cool characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. The movie starts with action star Leo Fong as a down and out policeman approaching the end of his career as he stumbles on a major case involving corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the murders start. From the start, Fong completes in this must see action caper. This film also co-stars Richard Roundtree. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid, but when I got older I realized that this movie is pretty cheesy and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
