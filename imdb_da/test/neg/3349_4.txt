I saw this on a cheap DVD release entitled "The Entity Force". When I enjoy the cheesy 80's horror movie, I thought I was in for a real treat. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly boring, and you are constantly waiting for something to happen. It eventually becomes something interesting, but it is in the last quarter of the film. It's a case of too little late. When the action happens, it's not so great what we get, dead bodies are 'floating' along the ground and hunting for the girls in the mausoleum. It's not the absolute worst I've seen, but you can do much better. I would only recommend this to die-hard collectors of cheesy 80's horror.
