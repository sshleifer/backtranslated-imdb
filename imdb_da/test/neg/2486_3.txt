* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes subtitled "Life Everlasting." It is often taken as a reference to the final scene, but describes more precisely how dead and buried this once estimated series is after this dull and illogical send-off. <br /> <br /> There is a "hi kids, let's put on a show air" about this telemovie, which can be endearing in spots. Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy identifying all the different cameo appearances. Co-author, co-producer Tom Fontana and his friends pack with friends and favorites from other shows as well as genuine Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> The casts, your old favorites as well as the later non-favorites are on top of the returns of almost all the TV show members. <br /> <br /> There was always a tug of war, quality-conscious executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious NBC execs, who simply wanted another moronic police procedure like "Nash Bridges "who regularly beat" Homicide "in the ratings. The press told when the show jumped between raging realism that exceeded its form and slacking sensationism that averted it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this movie, Fontana, co-authors Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel. They took the most ridiculous story from the series, topping it with an unlikely and artistically barren new plot line, and bringing the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members. <br /> In short, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of Baltimore's murder union, Yaphet Kotto as Lt. Al Giardello, is now a Kurt Schmoke-like candidate for mayor, and Schmoke himself makes a cameo look. But this promising start immediately and presumably takes a tragic trip. <br /> <br /> Spotlight switches to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son Mike. A beautiful man who has done good work elsewhere was Esposito one of the beautiful faces that was brought in late to sense the television series. But the question for the viewers was always: is Mike the unpleasant that Gees's son, or is Esposito the unpleasant in the role? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito doesn't get a chance to play the main story without interruption. This is because the authors choose this moment to revive another story spitting on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters. <br /> <br /> A seemingly snuff streaming video was promoted and then actually seemed to take place on the internet. After some red herring, the detectives arrested a repulsive suspect. But Zaljko Ivanek's harassed and overworked Vice-State lawyer forgot to submit the philosophy in time, and the suspect was released, only to be murdered later. Let's sum it up: he forgot to submit the paperwork because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, lawyer, governor, entire Maryland legislator, US lawyer general, NBC, Court TV, BBC, AP, Reuters , People, The Sun, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World rang not every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the old gang of detectives and associate friends flock back to Baltimore to help. There is a lot of talent on display. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogue to be provided, some of them are only on display. Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally under-utilized, while time wasted on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on advertising. The authors seem to satirize this and present Jason Priestley as the latest big deal detective. On the other hand, they give the casual, easy-go Michelle Forbes a very influenced scene. There is some other dull casting with the actual Lt. Gary D'Addario, in the middle of the book, which gave rise to the show and played another detective. Guests fall in from other shows, as Whitney Allen makes her deadpan and clueless "Miss Sally" from the children's show loved by the inmates at Fontana's "Oz." Your Naples by WBAL TV will appear as themselves. <br /> <br /> Even when entertaining, these guests can be distracting. Ed Begley Jr. actually promotes the story of his short appearance and plays Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontana's "St. Elsewhere." He is still a living character and fits into a hospital setting. Then you remember that St. Elegius didn't turn out to be an autistic boy's imagination? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects the company's synergy. This movie was made when Court TV bought re-run rights to the series. That network legally contributed to Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the murder and later appeared on "Oz." The TV correspondent does an effective job that sums up the news, ie, plot points for lower ones. Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, Lucaitis also handles some physical comedy with Esposito. He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. Perhaps the two must have made a spin-off. As the film turns down, the creams of the casting rise to the top. Even though they lost a loser, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome it. Their performances are reminiscent of viewers, what made homicide, for significant stretches, the best show on the air, and one of the best television productions ever. It's fun to see the tops do their thing; It's just a shame that this movie doesn't give them more chance. Die-hard fans may want to watch the movie anyway, but you can live without it.
