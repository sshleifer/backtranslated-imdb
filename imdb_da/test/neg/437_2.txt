AWiP is trying to be fun, scary, excited and romantic ... and fails in every respect. The play is at best average, but mostly stupid. The special effects are not enough to compensate for the stupid plot units, and the chain between * ALL * characters is young. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to be angry with yourself, don't pay money to see it.
