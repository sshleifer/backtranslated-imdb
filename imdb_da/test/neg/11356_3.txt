This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I searched through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it would be abysmal naff and probably a rip-off of Snakes On A Plane, but it sold brand new to 69p so I figured I didn't really have much to lose. /> <br /> The music played over the opening credits does not fit at all, even though I liked the song itself, a pop rock song is not really suited to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie. It started off surprisingly well, the opening scenes were not that bad, some of the actors were a little small, but not as bad as I originally thought it would be. Everything goes well for Laura Cayouette (Rocket from Kill Bill: Vol. 2) comes into the picture. She must play a scientist. If she is, she is not very bright. Fortunately, she has polished quite quickly. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was physically limping when the camera was beating over the passengers in the plane during a turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun? I was surprised she didn't collide with a cross. <br /> <br /> Finally after 35 minutes we get to some zombie actions and use the word 'action' solved. Special effects are slightly below standard, but can be expected from a movie with this budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses doesn't make you look like a zombie even though it makes you look pretty entertaining. Using slow motion also doesn't work very well. I think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much history. Trying to avert the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not a particularly good move, even in view of malaria is not a virus. The rest of the movie is pretty much like any other zombie movie. Most of the characters are killed and it ends up with a handful of people struggling to stay alive. Perhaps the worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is the utterly unthinkable ending. I know it's a movie about people coming back to life and partying on the living, but the ending was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
