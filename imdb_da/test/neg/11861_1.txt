Anyone who writes that this is a good thing that child can have worked on it or put money into this God-fearing college experiment. It was miserable, slow and painful to see. Driving time of only approx. 84 minutes, it felt like three and a half hours. The only one due is the director, who knows nothing about how to lead a scene where to place the camera! 95% of this horrible movie was shot by long bounces. Two or three people in the frame talk or shout forever (or whatever seems like forever), no close-ups !! No medium shot !!. There are two so-called battle scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shot some close-ups or medium shots to them. They looked very amateurish. The scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if there was a piece of only the father or only the son who acted or reacted. Tri-C must be very mortified to show this to anyone. I've seen a bunch of bad movies in my time, some of them are funny because they're so bad, it's not one of them.
