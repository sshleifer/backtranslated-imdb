This is a very very bad movie! <br /> <br /> The reason is weak the play is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> The special effects are convincing. The dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step of the way you can see comes a mile away. The end is disappointing and there is no excitement. The best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. The only reason not to give this a lower voice is because it is a TV movie and I think the budget was low at first. <Br /> <br /> I think the young female fans of Luke Parry will still watch this movie, but he has done better work. Again, this is terrible. Very very very terrible. If you have a choice, look at something else.
