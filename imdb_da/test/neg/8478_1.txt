-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy who wants to be an animator but cannot get his career off the ground. His super hot wife is more successful, and she doesn't seem to care about being a loser, but the man is not happy with it and wants to make more of his life. One day their dog gives them a magical mask that changes their life. Unfortunately, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask, and once he finds the man with the mask, he tries to get it back, and that's the whole story. If it sounded exciting to you then throw some water on you to wake you up <br /> <br /> -This movie is horrible. There really is no other way for me to say that, and I just can't stretch it enough. The only good thing about it all was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was warm, but apart from her there is nothing about this movie worth seeing. I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic, but what about the adults who have to take their children to see this garbage can. Why do we have to suffer through this dizzying puff of horrid crap. The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great storytelling. This is a huge attempt at hack filmmakers to redeem at the franchise and judge by the ridiculous BO gross. I guess the franchise no longer goes. <br /> <br /> the filmmaker must be hit hard because the film's sugary colors make you want to throw. If there was music, I didn't notice it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent me from hearing the horrible dialogue. Then there are plays or at least what passes to act today. you could see an infomercial and look much better acting in it than that in this movie, but I can't really blame the actors as it is the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors were going to take another king. If a new line seems to start a franchise with this, they'll have to play their game by hiring writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will see some bad news coming out. <br /> <br /> - Bottom line if you are a sadomasochistic and you love to torture yourself so please check it because it is painful to see but if you are not and you actually like Watching movies that are good so avoid it at all costs
