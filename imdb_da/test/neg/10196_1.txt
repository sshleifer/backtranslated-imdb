This movie was horrible. It's not something people have to pay to see. It seems that a Christian group has made people transform. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to television. It started out as an old-fashioned B movie sci-fi movie from the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie, the characters begin to talk about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It goes quickly into the pure area of ​​religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has bad acting; bad camera angles and amateurish. <br /> <br /> AVOID IT!
