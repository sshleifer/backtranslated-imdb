Screen processing of the comedic Broadway success "The Gay Divorce" (a title that was considered too scandalous for American filmmakers, although used in the UK) concerns a man and woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who meet under embarrassing circumstances while she is separating her spouse they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue a little more and dance a little more. Betty Grable is very appealing for a short while (singing and dancing in the song "Let's K-nock K-re" with overtly sissed Edward Everett Horton), but the star chamber looks uneasy and unhappy all the way through. The surroundings are scrub-sophisticated, but the signs are no more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 from ****
