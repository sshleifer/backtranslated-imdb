I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10. <br /> <br /> I went into this and didn't understand what it was - and discovered it's apparently a kind of African musical - as people break into the song of a few minutes. </ br /> <br /> None of the songs rhyme, most say nothing reasonable and they all have the same non-existent tunes - if you could call it a "tune". Karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actor looks like she's probably done some modeling.] The film opens in a woman's prison, even though it's not like a prison I've ever seen or heard about - the inmates carry whatever they want - and seem to have a party. <br /> <br /> The frame makes some hectic dance, and the prison women Angelique [is a beautiful beautiful woman] are certainly erotic interested. She and Karmen dance together. Later, Karmen visits the host's room and they love - unfortunately, the scene is not detailed and it is very short, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> The body escapes from prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named Lamine might be a colonel - it was never really clear who he was, looking at her. He is with a young woman who does not like Carmine's seductive dance, and there is a dance-off between the two women. <br /> <br /> After that, the story becomes [as] even more confused. <br /> <br /> With Lamin in prison, out of jail and who knows where. <br /> <br /> The frame may be involved in a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> There's more song. More dancing, and a scene in Angelique obviously suffers from heartache. <br /> <br /> The movie confuses its way to a finish and I hit a sigh of relief that it had ended. <br /> <br /> <br />
