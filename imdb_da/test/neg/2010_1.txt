My original comment on this particular title was deleted by an IMDb user or staff because I just happened to dislike this movie to the point I had to write sincerely what I felt after seeing this bad excuse for a movie. where is my freedom to be? <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was made by students, 'cos so lame and amateur it felt. Of course, should they even start from somewhere? The scripture was incoherent and it was also the actor. What can you expect with low budget and b-class players? There are some CGIs in places so poor, it looks like done with an old PC. Some may say it is such an "Alien" clone, only this time it is Dracula (in a vintage costume) who sucks the other one who molds dry one by one. The sets are convincing, cheap and small (boiler room), although the story takes place in a large spacecraft. <br /> <br /> It would be fun to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) were thinking of the movie after it was released ... Coolio must be the worst rapper turned actress ever! <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time and money, do not know why I myself plagued renting this flick. Honestly, I just hate this movie. With Uwe Boll's House Of The Dead, Dracula 3000 shares the dubious honor of being the worst movie ever. (Well, I've seen even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other movie will do better.
