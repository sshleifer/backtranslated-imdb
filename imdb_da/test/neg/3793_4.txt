I had also waited a long time to watch this movie. As far as I know, it has never been released in Australia, so in the end I found a copy online and ordered it in there. Weeks after my order confirmation finally came, and I was very excited to finally sit in front of my TV ready to watch a movie that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of ​​the world where so many good movies are. What a disappointment. Within the first few minutes I realized that I had ordered a B Degree, but was still full of expectation. I convinced my son (18) to see it with me, which I love to share when I find a movie of value with good underlying statements and / or stories. About halfway up he stood up and said he couldn't stand it anymore, it was so predictable and amateurish. I agreed, but then to the end. The action was horrible even for B Grade standards. The steroid type is also predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna, who must have cringed after seeing the film depicting them in such a way. There is no doubt about racial prejudice in many parts of the world, not just the states, but in reality, I doubt they will get away with all the ridiculous alibi presented this day. I had to double check the date the movie was made as their attempt at gimmicky recording of the more gruesome scenes was something I would expect from a high school's first attempt to make a movie 'indy'. I would like to see this movie put in the hands of experienced screenwriters and filmmakers, it's an old story, but one that can still pack a blow if treated professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I enjoyed.
