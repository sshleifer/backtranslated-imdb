I must admit, I love horror movies ... especially the 80s slasher movies. Hell, I even love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But I didn't think much about this movie. The death scene was not very well done, CGI was horrible, and the play was hum. Worst of all was the story that didn't make sense at all. I would say save your money, but chances are if you want to watch this movie ... you will anyway. I didn't hate it ... it's just not that good. All in all, it's just another bland, lifeless horror movie that lacks life (it's not surprising that this was on the shelf at Dimension for over a year after it was completed).
