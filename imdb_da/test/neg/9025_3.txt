Even die hard John Wayne fans will have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is on the verge of killing his parents, led by half Apache, half-white renegade Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), who was like a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many stupid plot points to count, but those that stand out are Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) cuffing a trapped Zanti around his boot, so everything Zanti has to do to get free is removed his boot! Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back and returns well as new for the rest of the story. In a hunting scene, Tobin rides with a delayed flame through a drainage barge surrounded by timber walls in the middle of a desert, missing his field, chasing (actually following) Zanti to foot through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but OOPS !, he did not see the sign over the water hole called "Do not Drink Poison". When Zanti collapses death, Tobin resumes his sequel to the rest of the gang and captures the entire party by blowing up a stone wall that seals a secret passage in Dusty's cabin - how practical. <br /> <br /> In the closing scene, the new sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone and speaks to the new wife Tobin (Sheila Terry), Dusty's daughter Ruby, who earlier in the movie was a kidnapping target for Zanti's gang. Apparently, the studio was envisaged that Wayne got the girl in almost any movie they made with him, as this type of ending is quite predictable for almost every Lone Stars movie.
