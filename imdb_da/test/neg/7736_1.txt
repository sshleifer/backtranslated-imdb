Hero's message is quite clear: the idea of ​​Greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions. At a time when China kills its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of overproduced, state-sponsored, dogmatic garbage. Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly joined Hero. In this way, they have implicitly legitimized their reactionary political message. The only critic (who I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice who wrote about the film's "sanctimonious traditionalism" and its "glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of greatness of the altar." I draw for my name during Hoberman's last statement: Absolutely nothing but "fascinating fascism".
