the worst movie I've ever seen, I didn't even look at it all, I just quickly forwarded it to Burts bits and saw the end !!! he is the only reason to see this !! I have to admit owning a copy as I am a big Burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection, I didn't want to break when this movie came out, I had a nightmare rent ten when my room shop only had 2 copies and fans of all the different stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie !! THERE ARE NOT RETURNING QUALITIES ABOUT THIS MOVIE !!! Absolutely nothing that ever likes this movie !!! this movie became an ongoing joke between myself and a friend Burt worst !! Rob Lowe's worst HOT TIME AND A HALF IN MY LIFE
