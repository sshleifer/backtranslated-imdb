We all have to start somewhere, it was in movies like Escape In The Fog that anyone like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before they showed good movies. In fact, the film was dated before it even hit the film, which was published on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war of Europe was over for almost two months, of course, even Harry Cohn couldn't control the events of history. So I wonder why even public questions did not question why a Nazi spy ring helped Japanese. Another very poor historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater. The cloak and dagger material was the area of ​​the CIS in that part of the world. <br /> <br /> When you are a FBI man like William Wright, it's good to have a mental girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is on a mission to the Orient to supply the names of the main underground leaders to start a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. Germans who have the buggy Otto Kruger house learn about this and the whole movie is used with these guys who have already lost the war and are trying to help their allies. Who by the way, they refer to as 'japs'. When Foch is sidetracked by a speed car and knocked unconsciously, she dreams of Wright's danger and sees what will happen to him at the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and foils the plot. <br /> <br /> Everything you'd expect from a nice noir movie is there, the silly atmosphere of San Francisco, the poorly lit sets, Budd Boetticher tried his best to throw. But they were just not convincing, probably because they didn't believe in this climbing itself. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but unlikely, that Nina Foch's dream and its psychic consequences could have been more developed, and the development was left on the floor. I think it was just a miserable manuscript. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures had the fast-paced events of history toward them here.
