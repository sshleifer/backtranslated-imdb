To quote a critic's review of the movie, "it started slowly and stopped." The reason was credible enough (although some of the character's actions seemed very, very RANDOM), the manuscript was quite well-written (since the dialogue did not seem forced), but everything went too slowly. There were too many breaks between lines, and the way the lines were delivered was not that great. This film had potential but blew it like a teenager who turned to drugs. My advice? Wait for it to come on TV before you see it.
