The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music, and this is the highlight of the movie <br /> <br /> "As for Theo?" everything, but especially excitement. I doubt if there has ever been a slower slower moving movie than this one. Yes okay it is a European art house film, so I do not expect that Charles Bronson massages hordes of evil guys, but even though I expect some substance if it is not a concrete plot <br /> <br /> The film is about Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visits Venice. Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out of his hotel window, and if it is excitement, you will have Gustav a feedback <br /> <br /> Bad enough if this was the whole movie but it gets worse because Gustav notices a beautiful boy teenager. So you have a medieval academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen, an old queen is obsessed with a stranger. Good idea for a movie? I also don't think so, and thank you, it remained a yawn party instead of some dull predecessor to gay porn. I notice many people praising this movie have tried to intellectualize it. I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my opinion and say that the only subtitle I could relate to was Gustav's physical and emotional disintegration, but it was not caused by the beautiful beauty of the teenage boy - it was caused by seeing such a boring and offensive film
