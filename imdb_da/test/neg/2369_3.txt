The movie version of 'Rising Damp' came out two years after the television series ended. Like many fans, I was right to go to the cinema when it was opened. I came away bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not have spent much time writing the script; Most are rehashed ideas from old episodes. At the time of film release, the "Rising Damp" series was still repeated regularly on I.T.V. So the public was asked to pay to see something they had already seen. At least the "On the Buses" movies boasted of original displays. <br /> <br /> Second, Richard Beckinsale died the year before, eliminating Alan's character as a sign of respect replacing art students 'John', played by Christopher Strauli of 'Only When I Laugh' fame. It was simply not the same. <br /> <br /> As another poster has pointed out, Rigsby's guesthouse didn't like what was used in the series, which is bigger and cleaner. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors working at the original 'Casino Royale', a movie imbued with surreal humor. 'Rising Damp' also has its share of 'Walter Mitty' style fantasy sequences such as 'Saturday Night Fever' parody. Personally, I found them terribly out of place. A case of 'over-egging pudding'. On the plus side, Leonard Rossiter is as magnificent as the sailed 'Rigsby', like Frances De La Tour as' Ruth 'and Don Warrington as' Philip. It's just a shame that the movie is not worth their talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by I.T.V. as a tribute, with its final scene - showing Rigsby, lying down by the stairs foot - removed for good taste.
