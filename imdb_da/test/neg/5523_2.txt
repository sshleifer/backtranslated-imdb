Every year, the company now produces pairs of "action packed", "full of suspense" films. This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III (Until I visited this site, I was not averse, this is a whole trilogy), is a good example of the good work the company does. Frank Zagarino is as mediocre as ever and does a good job as almost indestructible (?), Schizophrenic (?) Android. I will not waste any more words as I will not reveal the amazing plot and destroy you a few good laughs. Assessment 2/10 (Back to the hard-working tehnicians. Man, putting this kind of waste together must be nervewracking.)
