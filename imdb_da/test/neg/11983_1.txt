Not a good movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't as good for a '08 movie. Shots are just awful. Acting is "meh" It's nothing like Far Cry, except names and the very basic elements of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers go crazy). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting is quite different (tropical island in the game, the island of North America in the movie). <br /> <br /> I loved playing Father Father Scream. I loved the story and the setting. I hated the movie.
