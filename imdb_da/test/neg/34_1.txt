Jacqueline Hyde starts as another normal day for telemarketing person Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her to take personal calls at work, but that's not all bad news when the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died and that he left her his mansion and fortune (why does that not matter to me? Sigh). Very enthusiastic about Jackie's heads over there and making himself at home while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbled on a secret room where her grandfather stashed the bright red formula he invented, allowing him to drink it to change their appearance . Being a little on the porky side, Jackie finally puts on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), but Jackie's better-looking alter-ego begins to take control ... <br/> <br /> Written, co-produced and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was totally total & total crap from start to finish and it is as simple and straightforward as that. According to the opening bonuses, Jacqueline Hyde was inspired by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, honestly, if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here, he had turned in his grave. Initially, I think Jacqueline Hyde was / must be a horror movie, IMDb certainly listens to it as such, but there is nothing horror in it at all except how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more of a soft-core porn than anything else and extremely tame about it, why sit down and watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can see real hard-core stuff that actually deliver the goods? Why is that the question I ask here. It's not even good porn, besides being too soft, it's boring, boring and the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few and far between. The most intelligent aspect of this movie is the title, which would have been quite clever, if not for the fact that another movie used Jacqueline Hyde (1998) the title of the last century and judge by IMDb's plot collection, it sounds like hell much better than this nonsense. This is one of those movies you should see yourself to see how bad it is, but just hope you never get the chance. <br /> <br /> Of course, Director Kanefsky worked on a low budget, but this is not an excuse today, shot on a digital video camera, the movie seems to be cheap, and the few cases of CGI look as if they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final "shocking" twist probably has the worst morph effect I've ever seen, and it's pretty good for a laugh that's the scene when Jackie's tits grow through more horrible CGI. It's another thing that the movie takes too seriously. The subject sucks, is too predictable and makes for a bad movie, but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally fun with a little dirty porn, the movie could have been more fun to watch, unfortunately it is not so, it is not. Forget about decent horror, violence or doing, as there is no one except a surprisingly bloodless beheading at the end. <br /> <br /> Technical Jacqueline Hyde is home made movie type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point - & - shoot variety, music, production design and special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The action was horrible, it's serious about this. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Jacqueline Hyde is a bit shit, there is not a positive thing about this turgid movie I can think of. Any proper movie lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.
