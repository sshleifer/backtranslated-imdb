As other reviewers have noted, this movie is a cross between (ie stolen from) stories we've seen before. Specifically, it looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drives inserted in Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voil√†, an up-to-date driver. In this film, the "hero" is even more obviously a "Savior" than High Plains Drifter. Now, our very long brown hair, suffering a wound on his left side, and his entry into the city precedes a demand for "salvation" of the surviving townspeople - a rather transparent reference to a "second coming". I watched the movie on a hot and humid morning. Sleep was impossible, and after 4:30 there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. While unoriginal, with characters almost comic books, the movie is still somewhat entertaining ... at least at. 4:30 in the morning.
