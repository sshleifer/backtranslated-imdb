This must be the worst show I've ever seen. I've always seen Chuck Norris in Films, but why do we make these shows politically correct by adding a black sidebar that's as threatening as the Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy on the face and make it interesting. I know an African American who looks like this Trivette guy, and he gets his ass kicked once a week, he's all attitude. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, I think this show started well but lost the steam as time went on <br /> <br /> They should have dumped Chuck's page kick
