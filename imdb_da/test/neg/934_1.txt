I don't know what some of these filmmakers are thinking of doing the same type of clich√© movie over and over again, where the wicked (bad girls in this case) win. Weak trades and very predictable. Nothing original about it. The same movie has been made over and over - not different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005) or at least ten other movies with exactly the same story and ending. There are also many gaps in the movie. It's like they ran out of money and just stopped filming. Or maybe they run out of ideas. But don't waste your time with this one. It will only disturb you by wasting your time watching it.
