Yes. It takes a Norwegian to destroy and slaughter two good books and a concept that would work well on film - this film is really the worst Swedish movie of all time. I hated it so badly that I even considered going for it, something I've never done. But it was so terrible that I was almost convincing. I just had to sit through to the end. Much as part of the 80's Stallone action wheel, this really Swedish action takes back to the Stone Age. So full of logical errors and stupid mistakes is it almost entertaining - but who could ever see anything good in the terrible play Mark Hamill survives a minefield or the stupid, useless and irrational act? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: Are we not through clocks ticking down to zero, will the hero in time and two friends become enemies reuniting at the end? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> One more thing: The product placement in this movie is incredible. While other countries have understood that it should not be so heavy, the Swedish film industry has apparently not understood it all: Just look at the credit card Hamilton uses to open a window? Or ... this movie really makes me angry.
