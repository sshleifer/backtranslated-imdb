When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. All I could think was "You get the 8MM camera, I get my little brother's monster toys, we make a movie!" Why would anyone in a modern era like 2001 make a sci-fi movie like this, it looks like it was made in the early 80s. With actors who are like wood as a cigar store Indian, a script written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera stolen from a burning farmer's shop, an instructor who thought to make this crap would make them famous. The end result was not spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity. From Venus it must have been fun to make, and I'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their stupid little movie. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10 for a brave and hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
