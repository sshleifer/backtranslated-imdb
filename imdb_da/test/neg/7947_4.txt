I'm sure many guys will love this movie. The only woman who shows any "balls" (unfortunate puns) is made to look, talk and act like a guy, the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with a thing in their mind - sex / are sexy with Gender as their only trait and skill (Iris) - or who freaked out beautiful princesses who are neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before hell lost (Doc). The only strength of the iris is ultimately the result of some advice from a great strong man. Besides my negative bowel reaction as a feminist, I have to give the camera props - and Ethan Hawke is great in the very first scene. Then its performance loses steam. Empty entertainment for a brain who wants to take it easy. At least, the film is the subject of the duality of good / bad in the criminal mind.
