I have to admit that despite all the media promoting and being nominated for Oscar, my expectation from the movie was not so high until I saw it. And I really found what I expected; A film that is trying to be sympathetic to both conservative and liberal in Turkey is trying to be authentic to foreign spectators and enough fun for everyone. But it should be understood that it is not possible to be beneficial to everyone, and therefore film remains the average for everyone. The whole film tells a story arose within 24 hours. To customize the short story in a full movie length, some scenes are added without connection to the main story. These are mostly iceceller sales to the eccentric locals (ie goat forces, old women, etc.), and each of these sales scenes is trying to be of interest to the spectators at sketches of comic dialogues. The subject is referred to as a universal problem: Combating a local producer trader against holding companies and monopoly, but that was the interesting subject for twenty years before. Most readers will remember "Hero grocery store against supermarket" from Ferhan Sensoy in the 1980s. This was the right story at the right time. In short, the story is not strong enough and worth being a movie like today. <br /> <br /> Apart from some gibbers due to local accent, the performance of cast is so successful. The leading role is played by Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language, yet he is also lucky. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, for a limited budget, significant effort by the instructor and player naturally gives a good mood to the movie. But it does not result in a movie enough to compare with Italian neo-realists or worthy of the Oscar nominee. <br /> <br /> Note: In real life, the Islamist vendor would usually stop his own production and be the dealer of one of Manda's competitors.
