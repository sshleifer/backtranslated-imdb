I've seen "LOS" with my family since the first episode, it used to be great. Last season, it was very disappointing, it seems they (writers) don't know what to do with the show, so they try to make it up by stretching a story line in an entire episode. The current season, which, incidentally, I decided to watch only to see Rodrigo Santoro, and also with a little little hope that things would get better; has been a disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped to see. First of all, he sees (Santoro) only for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with the story, there is no real hopping, every episode can appear in 15 minutes. We see every episode waiting for something that never happens; I do not ask for any secret to be revealed at once, but what about a little variation in history? In the first and second season we had different story lines, so we saw the story, a little action, a little romance, now as a great event that takes the whole episode to reveal. It is almost tiring to see it when it is finished you have the feeling that you have lost your time. Now it is important to note that the actors are still great. I can't believe they killed Mr. Eko (Adelawale ...) he was awesome, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind, great, brave. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad boy" is a bit bleeding because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but it's cool. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should it be), but we hardly see them. I hope Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will have a big role on the show; If not, why did you make so much of him who joined the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry if I shook too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started to see it, it was good that I got used to it, and now it is very disappointing to see how it goes. I want to be here, hope for improvements !!! Katia
