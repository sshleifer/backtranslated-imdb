I know it's a movie. But when it comes to portraying real life (in any question) it must be as probable as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. The Dominican Republic is also not depicted as it really is. In fact, it shocked me to see that the movie to Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And amazingly, movies with Cuban themes (Havana, The lost city, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather part II) were actually filmed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot the movie in Cuba instead of D.R. The Spanish dialogues with the Cuban accent are terrible! It's not Dominics! At the historical level, Galíndez would never have been hanged. He might as well be shot, beheaded or died of the inhuman torture he had received. Then his body threw in the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by suffocation. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> Action is not delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he's just expecting a paycheck. I prefer the leading actress in "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the casting would have been excellent in some Cuban films, as would the chosen shooting venue. <br /> <br /> I suggest "La Fiesta del Chivo", from bestselling author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It's a little more realistic with Dominican history. The Trujillo character is very well portrayed, and the Galindez event is very briefly dealt with in this movie.
