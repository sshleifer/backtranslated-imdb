I've never made any comment here on IMDb, but when I watched this movie, I can't be quiet. I just created my account here only because of this horrible movie. In two words, this film is PURE CRAP. The movie has no meaning at all! Nothing makes sense in this movie. Watching this movie was pain all the way. I don't understand why Val Kilmer went in to make this movie. He plays a minor role as a gang leader, says few words, and he is there like 5 minutes in total. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based only on the Val Kilmer box name and the interesting pictures on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in the second review, Moscow stole Zero my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself brought the idea of ​​the assessment, which everyone should give it: ZERO
