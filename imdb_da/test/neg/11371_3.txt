Although it's not as bad as some movies (like the horrible "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" is still dependent on common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Technology in pursuit of a Master's degree, and it was easy to point out mistakes that would be obvious to everyone involved in the industry. Riding the false fears that a Chernobyl style melting can happen in an American plant, the film says that any burning (even partially, according to one of the guest's commentators in the movie) would mean disaster to the area. In fact, a partial degradation in an American plant while the destruction of the nucleus would not pose a risk to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released into the environment at all thanks to the natural stability of fuel and core designs used in that country paired with significant containment. <br /> <br /> The security steps in the movie were perhaps the part of the film farthest from the truth. At any important strategic location - be it power plant, chemical plant, military base, anything - you will never see staff respond to an alarm by cutters around talking as if it were an unannounced exercise. This is especially true of a nuclear power plant where the reactors at the break will be SCRAMed immediately and shut off. SCRAMing can be performed at the touch of a button in the control room (you do not need to put the kernel into "shutdown mode" as shown in the movie), and the nucleus of atomic fission prevents a core from being brought back into power within about one minute. 9 hours by a SCRAM. So, if this scenario played out in real life, the attackers would not be able to cause significant degradation. In theory, they can still cause a partial due to residual heat if they immediately expose the core, but it would be almost impossible given the many backup systems found in a plant - there are many more than the individual back-up pumps they talk about in the movie. <br /> <br /> With regard to spent fuel pools, it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up, but it is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. The fuel is below (approx.) 18 feet high purified water. The water cannot become radioactive (no radioactive vapor they are talking about in the movie). Particles dissolved in water can, but the water itself cannot; thus the reason for very thorough cleaning. So the only way to hit a fuel pool in a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. This is not an easy task, as the water is very heavy and the pools are underground with very thick concrete walls. The explosives should be in the pot below the fuel (which is attached firmly). And there should be a lot of lots of explosives, as the water is * very * difficult to move through an explosion. Although this would happen, spent fuel is not extremely radioactive and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death as mentioned in the film, especially considering the small amount of radioactive material that would be dispersed. <br /> <br /> From a basic movie point of view, I grew a little tired of the style used. The constant fading in and out, using gritty black and white, and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish. The signs were one-dimensional, especially those in the US government. I have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie but will not discuss it as it would be a great spoiler. Overall 3/10
