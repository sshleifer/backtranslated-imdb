Now let me see if I'm right, a galore serial killer is going to murder real estate agents .... okay ... what's wrong with that scenario, I can live with it. Next, is a treasure chest slaughtered with tax inspectors? Traffic department killed? Should we feel any sympathy for empty-headed and superficial money-possessed property owners? Is ... no. Unfortunately, it's fun aside, it's just not a very well-filmed movie with bad actors and raw effects, the climate scene is very stupid. You can almost see the instructor shouting, "action" to the stuntman as he falls through the window glass. As another reviewer rightly said, following the lead in 'The Fog', this was the nadir of Adrienne Barbeau's career. Therefore, I was pleased to see that she had revived it by becoming Catwoman's voice in Batman's animated series while watching extras on live action Catwoman movies. NOTE: Not quite the horrible movie it's made to be by the way. <br /> <br /> However, this is a bad movie, think of a bad episode of 'Kojak' or 'Streets of San Francisco' and you will get an idea of ​​what is being offered here.
