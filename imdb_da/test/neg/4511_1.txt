This is really a re-husband who should never have come out of the stable. It has two throws that work in completely different layers. At the top of their game is Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of the Franks is in a pure view. At the rock bottom are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Schell and Plowright are doing so well when Gilbert and Roberts work their anti-magic. Gilbert destroys every scene she is in. It's like a father who knows the best in the ghetto. She is Ann Frank's light. Her run at Helen Keller was thin but not horrible. This is sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs Van Damm just annoying. She is a totally inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious and dissatisfied presence created so many problems in the hot Acherhuis. This was to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered how happy it was. Her weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully. Roberts was in a career high when this was made, got lots of press and many opportunities. Her performance shows her weaknesses as an actress. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Reville have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and though they are, they are totally incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners. Reville is a wild actor capable of the kind of iconic performance that Ed Wynne gave in the original movie. He gets no support from Gilbert. She drains the color out of each scene. <br /> <br /> With horror I have read the comments of those who grew up seeing this version, full of attachments for these shows. It is a lesson on how the version you see first attaches to you. It makes me reconsider my affiliation with some subordinate products I loved in my childhood. I urge you to see the original. It has very few faint spots and it is head and shoulders above this root.
