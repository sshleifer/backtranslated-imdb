As everyone knows, nobody can play Scarlett O'Hara as Vivien Leigh, and no one can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. Everyone else pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exceptions. One thing that I really couldn't get past was that Joanne has brown eyes. The green eyes were the most prevalent feature of Scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she was removed by them. <br /> <br /> The film, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. The new characters were not all memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt like her to Ireland did absolutely nothing at all. It could be that I am only 11, but I saw no change in her attitude to last words, 10 minutes, when Rhett told her she was an adult. Had Rhett not told her, I would never have guessed that there was any change in her attitude. She really loved Cat, her baby. She likes this kid because she was with Rhett, her only beloved man. Still, if you have read Gone With The Wind, you would see that children do not make any difference in Scarlett's world. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it seemed to me that there was too much going on without Rhett. Everyone is concerned about whether Rhett and Scarlett come together again, and Scarlett took too long to get to it. It's almost nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but then again what isn't it? If you've read the novel, you'll like it better than the movie. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see it just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind, whether it's worth it. It may not satisfy you completely, but it will get you some of the way there.
