A single mother, her son and daughter and their hippie chick friend camping in the woods. A muscle-bound machete wielding maniac in a yellow ski mask appears. He begins to terrorize and sexually offend the family before killing them with a machete. "Wet Wilderness" is filled with ugly hardcore sex, forced incest and overtly racism. It's as politically incorrect as XXX roughies get. The score is stolen from the usual Hitchcock horror classic "Psycho" and also "Jaws". The action is hilariously horrible, editing is bad, and there are some major deviations in the logic. The repetitive nature of the gender scene cuts the film so that the short run time is a blessing. The scenes of violence are quite unpleasant, for example, the hippie girl is stacked with machete in her groin and you can see blood on her step.3 out of 10 and it is generous.
