I can't stress it enough, DO NOT * get this movie for the kids. <br /> <br /> For that matter, you will also save the adults as well. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe I'm a little exaggerated. This is not the worst children's movie ... no, let me rephrase it. This is not the worst movie made by adulterated adults FOR these piled adults and somehow marketed to children (it would be "Jack" that I intended to go through / gut like a fish). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn anything surprising (well, if you have to, jump right before the end credits for a lesson on an interesting cosmic phenomenon). We usually do not end up as adults, what we wanted to do as children as reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you (it can also be four years of college at an art school, but I do retire). I have no idea what the cool kids could get out of this movie. Most likely, it will only interfere with them (we will see the moment when Russ was traumatized by eight years). There is a better movie, "Kiki's Delivery Service", which essentially has the same message, but handles it smartly rather than drilling it in the head. And the adults also like it! <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K's in mind if they think of the other Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.
