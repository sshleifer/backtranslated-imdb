I'm pretty surprised to see that this movie has earned even lukewarm reviews, I found this movie even horrible. The plot floats around trying to determine whether it is a comedy or a thriller, so it realizes that it cannot be reached either. So it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot highlighted with an unintentional hilarious scene with Laura Linney, an injection and wasted coffee that leaves the audience scary to choke in their seats and look at each other like this for real? Basically, it is immensely and truly disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and it makes you believe that someone extorted Laura Linney to add this piece of waste to her otherwise respectable resume. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish I had, even see it for free I wanted someone to pay me for my waste time. The computer's glitch / twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and in the end you don't care who wins the election. I vote directly to DVD.
