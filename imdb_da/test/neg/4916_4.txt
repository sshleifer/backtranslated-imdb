Not a good one. Nothing at all. This episode is about the origins of the original murderer in the Amityville home, facing his past to get rid of Amaryd's suicidal nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much nothing. My bet is that this movie was made for some extra quick money to buy a boat or something ... because this is just ridiculous ... Fortunately, it doesn't kill or destroy the series, but it has no effect on the series at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that just the fact that it is always referring to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one a little more tolerable than "The Amityville Curse".
