I watched this movie at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2005. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared in the EIFF program to Sideways - which I liked - so I was really looking forward to this movie. I also liked the Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite etc ... so I have had good recent experiences with some weird American indy movies. Unfortunately, I found that the Puffy Chair does not compare favorably with any of these films. <br /> <br /> I sat for 35 minutes waiting for something entertaining, witty, insight or even mildly interesting to happen. It didn't - and the shaken video camera made me sick - so I went. <br /> <br /> This is just the second movie I've ever gone from (the first one was "Showgirls"), which is a bit disappointing. I probably would have lasted the duration if it hadn't been for the nauseating picture of the nauseating picture - but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I would miss something. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
