I have always said that there is nothing to beat the original form: the comics. I've proven right again. This, like any other movie on the Asterix series, failed to impress. The authors of this movie do not understand that what makes all the other such cartoon films (x-men, superman et al.) Venture's successful is that they all deviate from the original comics and adapt it to make it more attentive. Agreed this movie was different, in the sense that this film was a cross of two Asterix books, namely. Asterix and Great Crossing & Asterix and Norman. In addition, a love interest for one of the protagonists was introduced uncharacteristically to the Asterix series (red asterix and the secret weapon). All this ended up doing was creating a childish immature story. The fun parts were very few and far between. All in all, a total waste of time and money that sees this, let alone at theaters, even at home.
