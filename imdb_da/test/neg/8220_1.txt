For those who can send me ugly emails, push it. There is a tendency in Hollywood where those who create too quirky films are immediately impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, Zach Braff, the star of a rather overstated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but it doesn't guarantee that kind of praise like a movie it has received. The story is often too thin and low to give a real insight. People have compared this movie to The Graduate, but those kinds of people are the types trying to pass independent cinema. Indie movies are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the study movies, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie movies than good ones. The Garden State is not terrible, but it's not amazing. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is too fast, resulting in a rather rapid resumption of Large in its past life. After ten years, people tend to act as he never left. Where is it awkward? Of course, the situation is always resolved by a quick drug-making scene (which I would say was described fairly precisely). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, giving us the idea that emotions will come up later in a deeper and more thoughtful way. But it fails to deliver on these fronts and leaves us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments was quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's serious tendencies). It wasn't quite huge, but maybe we should stop praising the movie as something it is not.
