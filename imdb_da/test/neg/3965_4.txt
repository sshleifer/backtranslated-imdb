A man is pulled off a London street and taken to a foreign land where he is being tortured as a terrorist. Boring, banal movie bored hell out of me. More an idea than a movie. I was halfway into this 77 minute movie when I realized I didn't know who was on the screen. It was as if they took all other similar films and pulled out all the ideas and put them in one place without the real notion of character. Certainly, it was passionate, but there is no emotional center, there is just one man of the kind who the filmmakers feel is enough. It is not. And while the story presented id theoretically as a warning, the movie is too dull to convince any of it, especially if you have seen the other, better movie of similar ilk (for example with Reese Witherspoon for example)
