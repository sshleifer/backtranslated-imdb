This movie looked fun on the cover and I honestly thought 'how bad can it be?' Little did I know. Out of the gate, the dialogue was unworthy. It was constructed, unrealistic and not even interesting. Dialogue on UPN syndicated TV shows is more natural. The story was impossible and had almost zero play-off at the end. The end with the tubing is almost confusing and seemed to be staged. The only extremely interesting character is Rose McGowens, who is dumb, which prevents her from being spoiled by the cliche ridden garbage dialogue (well, at least until the end, even when she is to speak). The only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is Rose McGowen's naked scene. Really horrible. Save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting as a Barney Video.
