An apparent vanity pushes Julie into her first movie with Blake. Let's see. Where do we start She is a traitor during a world war; she solves it by falling in love; her friends (who are probably patriots because they are German citizens) are consumable and must die; and she wins up as a heroine. OKAY. The scenes of the drunken pilot and the buffoons working for French intelligence cannot even be described and we will not even mention Rock's romantic scenes with a woman. (By the way, when they visit a museum, look at his gaze - I recreate it on video and it's invaluable). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don't know and you don't want to.
