Imagine what it might have been for John Agar. One of Hollywood's beautiful leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself making movies like this. I remember him in "Tarantula" where he wasn't half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this movie. The monster is stupidly uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. Teenagers are boring. The reason is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to promote the plot. There is dancing that continues and then there is no attack. There is some idiotic love triangle that nobody could care less about. It's not even campy or outrageous. It's just not worth anything. Agar might as well have been a post. He hasn't given anything to do.
