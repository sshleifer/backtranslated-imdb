Do not waste your time. The reason draws, the signs are wood and uninteresting, the motivation of their actions is utterly indelible. Held waiting for the "romantic" or "comedy" to occur and nothing has happened. Even worse, the love letter is not even romantic, but sounds like it was written by someone desperately making a deadline. Did I mention that "plot twist", which we saw from 15 minutes in the movie, was "Hollywood smart", which means it's supposed to shock, but considering the Hollywood mentality - does nothing of that kind and in the place is vaguely offensive. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth $ 2 to rent. Don't see it.
