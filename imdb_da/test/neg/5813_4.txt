I love Hedy Lamarr. I think she was very undervalued as an actress in her 40s. She was Nastasia Kinski in that era, and critics did not take her seriously. Having said all that ... this movie is a BORE. When I saw it for the first time, I was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in history but in makeup and costumes. Hedy's makeup shifts from shot to shot. It also makes hair length and style. Reason: This thing had so many authors and reviewed so many stops and starts it is amazing that they have ever released it. Her "Lady of the Tropics" began filming after this began, but it was released before "I take this woman." In fact, at that time, it was known in Hollywood as "I take this woman again." It should tell you something. I'm also a Spencer Tracy fan, but he's AWFUL here. I have read in various film stories that he totally despised Hedy Lamarr, and it looks quite obviously on film. No chemicals at all. The story wanders around for wheels after wheels and finally rolls to one end very strange. I can't recommend this at all.
