Mr. Kennedy should stop the exposition of bad film writings. What was he thinking about? This is a movie that should not have passed "hi, I have an idea, let's make a sequel" phase of the start. If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it, but I suppose I will settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie copies will dig An old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns out. (Hi, I said "hit and run!" Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How this piece of waste has ever seen the light of day is beyond me. It's full of unpleasant humor, weird animation, and jokes that don't take you completely beyond a state of confusion. If you are drawn to this movie and someone is paying for you .... fine .... but it is getting more and more painful than a brick in the forehead. But if you plan to pay your own hard earned money, look for a better alternative.
