I was looking for ATTACK on Precinct 13. There is the movie the memorable one. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can't tell who the leading actor is, it's a pretty big point against the movie there) Gabriel Byrne (who didn't need the money so badly could he?) Drea De Matteo is great but only because of her amazing body. It took me ages to finally train, she is Joey's sister from "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people who attack the station are beautiful when it comes to tactics. We were even taught better basic skills than this in RAF basic education. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, even if the snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very poor continuity indeed. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
