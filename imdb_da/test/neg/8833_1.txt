I'm sorry, but I honestly can't see why anyone would actually like this. It's stereotypical and real homeschoolers are nothing like they were on this show !! Personally, I am glad it was canceled after the first episodes. I think this kind of show would definitely be okay if everyone knew that homeschoolers were not really here and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately, not everyone is aware of it. If anyone out there, who saw this, actually thought that is what goes on in a homeschooler's life, then I honestly feel for them. This reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of homeschooled kids in "Mean Girls". It is sad that people think this way. This is complete waste, IMHO.
