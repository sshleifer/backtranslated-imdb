I actually trawled through the whole set of reviews, searching for those who gave this movie less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is absolutely enchanting! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie, and it's not directed by Christopher Nolan, but good Lord. This is just-to-bargain-bucket nonsense. They should have done with it and animated the bloody stuff. <br /> <br /> What's even worse is that IMDb won't let me just finish my rant there because my review needs to be longer! <br /> <br /> The "Awesome" in-game cameras are LITERALLY taken from Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story plods as a sulking school boy, the multi-stranded character and plot development curls an already weak setup and the grand finale is slightly boring. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it was really the biggest movie I've ever seen in my entire life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic-looking costumes, sets and sports equipment. I said so.
