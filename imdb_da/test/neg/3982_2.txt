This movie had an interesting enough plot about clones and organ use, but it fails because the main actor is so annoying and whiny that you want him dead. Not that anyone else is very good at it either, but when you hate the character to forgive your sympathy, the film just fails to work. It's funny enough that it looks like a movie comes out in the near future, which has a plot that reflects this with more action and better throw, although I can't think of anything else, but this movie if I was watching it. This movie has a super stupid clone that somehow is smart enough to find out that there is something wrong with its camp, where people ride one mile per mile. Time and struggle for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they are ready, they go to America, but our "hero" is in doubt, so he snoops around and learns the horrible truth that sends him on the go from the evil shooters and the guy repeatedly . He looks at the man he was cloned from. Peter Graves is in it, and that's Dick Seargent, but they don't add anything to this movie that looks like something made for television. On the plus side, although "The Island" comes out, the film's makers can proudly say "we first thought about it".
