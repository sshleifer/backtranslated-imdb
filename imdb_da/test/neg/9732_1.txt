It seems that when an ordinary film company wants to make movies for teenagers, it is only focused on one thing: sex. Don't make me wrong, I'm not bragging, but the fact that these people seem to think about getting my stones away is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take the Convention, a movie that trusts you so much that you find the protagonists attractive, it thinks it can get away without a plot and / or script not written by a six-year-old. This is mainly The Craft with (apparently) hot guys. And yes it is. It bored me to cry. Even my friend who usually runs us crap movies hated it. It's really amazing bad, to the extent that it can actually be fun. I would laugh if it were not for the fact that several other women in the cinema show seemed to enjoy it. They were accompanied by several shady boys who positively curled up and died when the (really clich√©) boy on the boy's kiss happened at the end. It was the highlight of the movie watching them. I don't think the mainstream, Hollywood movie theater will ever exhibit good movies for teenagers (or indeed for anyone) so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teenager who likes The Pussycat Dolls, Paris Hilton thinks it's "hot" and sees MTV as a kind of wasteland. Life is difficult when you are a fifteen year old who likes art houses. :( P. S. Someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls would find boy boys "totally HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
