When I wrote Savage Intruder in IMDb's search engine, one of the opportunities that emerged was the Savage Garden: International Video Collection: The History So far (1999), the only reason to mention this is because I am a great Savage Garden fan & you should do yourself a favor and check out some of their music like Affirmation or For the Moon and Back instead of bothering with this average pot kettle, sorry i just wanted to say it. Anyway, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM musical and premiere footage and a few spinning portraits that have no meaning whatsoever in the long run. It is late in the 1960s Hollywood and in the midst of the glitter and glamorous series are at work that select aging actresses, kill them and break down their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield as John David Garfield) jumps off a tour bus seeking employment when he stops at a now retired actress Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins) who was "one of the biggest stars in film ", but now lives in a large house with an older housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), a personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young girl named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine has recently broken her foot and needs a personal assistant and gives Vic the job. Slowly, Vic charms his way into Katharine's feelings and, more importantly, his great wallet. Vic begins to turn Katharine against the other employees, but Vic is not what he thinks. Vic is a drug-abused employee who gets Greta pregnant while still having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine & pamper Vic's incredible plans, but she has a close encounter with an ax, no one in the house is sure when Vic brings drugs, sex, rock'n'roll party and gardening to the Parker mansion while his scary plan Started to become increasingly apparent ... Written, produced and directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess, but a gentle entertainer at the same time. Scripture is everywhere and it can't really decide what it will be, Savage Intruder is suffering from an identity crisis! The movie starts with the discovery of a cut off head and limbs, just after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) is killed by a mysteriously unidentified figure, but then it is completely ditching the slasher film elements it just built up, never going back to them. Savage Intruder then becomes a kind of good movie like Vic befriends Katharine & shows her how to enjoy life again and has an implicit sexual relationship with her, it is actually disgusting to think of as she is old enough to be her grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a recluse & gives the alcohol when Vic seems to make her happy as they go to party together and hold banquets for Katharine's friend, whom she also used. This part of the Savage Intruder wouldn't look out of place in a Disney movie! Every so often the tedium is interrupted by the emotional stuff of Vic shooting up and having stupid hallucinations about his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and chopping her hand with an ax, he also has sex with Great at some point. So, after Greta has been murdered, Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror movie when Vic is revealed to the loony that he is. Savage Intruder does not flow properly as a movie in my opinion, as it mixes different genres with poor success. In the same way, murder mystery elements do not work and are frankly a bit of a puzzle, why go far to hide the identity of boys during the murder scenes, but then make it clear who is committing them all the rest of the movie anyway? Vic as a sign did not work for me, for a moment he is a cool, calm, clever and scary king and then he is a sharp raving loony! Why kill all his other victims, but with Katharine trying to keep her? What makes her so different? If that's because she has money, why not go after her at first? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the 60's dialogue is quite fun to listen to these days, as when Vic offers Greta painkillers, really hard drugs, and Greta says "What do I need painkillers for? "Vic's helpful response" because your a pain "wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic does some gardening & asks "do you have green fingers?" he answers "no, but I'm good at grass!" There is not much going on in the Savage Intruder, some separate limbs and a pair of decapitated heads. There is also a pretty impressive shot when someone has his hand cut off with an ax, which is probably why it is repeated three or four times. The stupid-looking fabric hallucination scenes should be seen as being believed. Technically Savage Intruder is ok, the location in the movie in the magnificent mansion and Hollywood Hills certainly gives it a better look than it deserves, the play is average as the rest of the production. Overall I would say Savage Intruder feels like it is trying to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away and as a result it just doesn't work. It's a mildly entertaining disposable clip at best and a complete mess of a movie worse, you decide which ones!
