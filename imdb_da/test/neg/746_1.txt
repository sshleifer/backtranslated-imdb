Shaky handheld cameras (this piece was shot to the television and not movies) don't keep you fully aware of how horrible the movie is in this movie, but make you totally incapable of being immersed in history. Poor Miss Austen should be rolled in her grave. All I can say is if you enjoy the novel, stop there until the BBC creates one of their clever and sensible period works (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, who, to say what I imagine, Austen would have honored) . The BBC would never dry overblown cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of a historic castle and a loving embrace. Giles Foster often seemed confused that they edited the music to the Specialist. If you want Austen that you love her, look for the BBC logo ...
