This lame Harold Lloyd sound film has a laugh in it and you wonder if this Lloyd is just the same that made all those lovely and funny audio signals. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's gruesome resemblance gets sweaty and lax when we can hear him talk, and a slow, reluctant pace replaces the black antics of his silence. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary growing up in China and then transplanting to today's New York City without a clue as to how life outside his Chinese village works. He finds himself an unlikely victory in a Mayor election and quickly chooses all government organizations because he refuses to see the other way towards violent corruption. When framed in an attempt to bring him down, he decides to play as dirty as everyone else, and performs a false performance of any villain in NYC as a frightening tactic. This dark satirical end feels out of place next to everything else in the movie, but it is the only part of the movie that comes distant to life. Everything else is a boring hole. <br /> <br /> I don't like to admit that a Harold Lloyd movie fails because I like him so much, but I have no choice with this. </ br /> <br /> Degree: D
