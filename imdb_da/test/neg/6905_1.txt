Words cannot describe how terrible this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'll take a stack on it: 1 - Nice. Hollywood makes several talking animals set in graphics. Apparently, script and storyline are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - violent. Kids movies, yet one of the characters is maliciously attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - Blatantly silly. The film actually shows the livestock as human abilities. In Nemo the fish could speak, but mostly they are still fish. We only hear English as a translation. In Barnyard, the animals are actually English, which other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unintelligent - No smart story or even smart humor. (Okay, the 13 year old dog on crutches was fun). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally Insensitive - The "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow plays a white actress. The black cow played a stereotypical black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorant - No one like a male cow I am aware of. I think we call them bulls? If we are to expose our children to death, it may as well have the simplest facts correct. <br /> <br /> 7 - Drilling and Borish. My 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes. He almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate because it only refers to Hollywood producers that the US public is pretty much filled with suckers and waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why do producers have to spend real money when returns are the same?
