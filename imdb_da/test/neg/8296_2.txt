Uggh! Hanna-Barbera from the 60s and 70s! What miserable and unmatched cartoons were printed on us by these hacks! It's a shame that in the 1940s and 1950s "Hanna-Barbera" meant quality - because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. But with the huge cost-saving end-of-the-1950s, comics generally began to look pretty poor and budgets were cut. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by the MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons! So at the end of the 50s the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat them, come with them" - and started producing horrible little cartoons themselves - with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing. /> <br /> It's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy cartoons seemed too good --- making them rich and the most successful cartoonists from the 60s and 70s. During this time, there were repeatedly poor production values ​​their norm, and a long list of very unforgettable cartoons was created. In this case, the incredibly bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE - a totally unfunny and stupid idea. If you want to know what the performance was about, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> The root to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us children!
