I saw the first scarecrow movie and not the bags out the one, although I knew it was b class it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing scarecrow was a great acrobat and had some good skills going. The effect was better and the costume as good as this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this with an open mind, I'm also a fan of ken shamrock (formerly ufc superfight champ) and hoped it was a decent movie. Boy was I wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both looks and actually was scary, the story was so predictable that it was like watching the movie in preview mode, which I would already guess what would happen, the music was so bad , with a horrible lip sync song that made me hit the screen. <br /> <br /> Generally, avoid this crappy movie. <br /> <br /> Save some money.
