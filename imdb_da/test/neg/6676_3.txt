Contrary to what a reviewer said, this is not a ripoff by Magnum Force. In one, Lieutenant Hal Holbrook put together his own little team from Academy rookies to send repeated offenders. In extreme justice, this operation has the penalty of the higher ups of the LAPD. How far they sanction the exact methods used is open to questions. <br /> <br /> This Special Investigation Squad seems to be the haven of the LAPD's misfits, those who have forgotten their first duty are protection and service. That is why Scott Glenn believes that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than his share of beef internal affairs for excessive use of power, is perfect for the team. <br /> <br /> What should have sent him running from Phillips is the fact that he has a good live-in relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. Anyone who probably threw me into this movie, would you think Lou would be the last guy he would try to recruit for his team. And what his team is, is a death group. They target the perpetrators and wait for them to take action. Then it's open season. <br /> <br /> External Justice was much overboard in trying to make a point. There would probably have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to end the robbery and take them outside. No civilians were injured, as Coffeyville's citizens made it to Daltons. Or wait for three rapists to finish the job before they enter. That was what was asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And honestly I couldn't buy it. Many good players are really wasted in this.
