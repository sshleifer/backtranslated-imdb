Roeg's assertion Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" was not exactly what I expected. Although it was based on one of history's most studied and interesting texts, the movie was just kind of boring. History just never understands the viewer. It is just as indifferent in a way. The traces of the text can easily be seen, but it is not really Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". Benedict Fitzgeralds (who also wrote "The Passion of the Christ") script uses only Conrad as an inspiration, and thus becomes Fitzgerald's "Heart of Darkness". The movie is just not worth it unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or maybe John Malkovich.
