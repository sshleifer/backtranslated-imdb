I was really disappointed with this movie. Great actors in it, and possibly a big plot, but it just seemed to be limping. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was masterful in his role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of his work on the screen was in car chases done with Austin Minis. Product placement has gone wrong, so very wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction also seemed. Edward Norton is the bad guy and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera would pass over it would be too long and Norton would grumble or something. C'mon, Hollywood, give us some credit! It's okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to telegraph it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie, but this one just hasn't had it.
