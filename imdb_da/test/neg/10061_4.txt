This is actually one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, confused mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and budget!) Of its predecessors ("Death on the Nile", "Evil under the Sun") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov, as far as the screen detectives go (of course he plays a character that is far less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to coast as far as it does on Christie's plot alone (all her plot has a certain amount of intrinsic interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
