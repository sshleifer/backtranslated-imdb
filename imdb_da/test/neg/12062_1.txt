Idiots go camping and act as idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you want a horrible bath than bad words that suit a badder than bad movie, "Camp Bloody awful"), is so bad It is actually quite depressing to see. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad movie ... Awful play. Bad script check. Tacky effects - Check no originality at all - double check. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even try to be different, and it is discarded with every predicted clich√© that can be imagined. For example, the film opens to a couple who have sex in the woods, so of course they are dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most worrying things is that this movie actually created two sequels, how and why just disturbs the mind. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this one.
