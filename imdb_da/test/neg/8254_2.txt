Oops. I hired this because I thought it was Bitter Harvest (1981) recommended. After the appearance of the horrible Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it can be seen because the protagonists are very sexy, but the play is terrible. Stephen Baldwin sees morose all the time, which is understandable given his co-star. Patsy competes with Liz Hurley for the title of the most obviously useless on-screen actor?
