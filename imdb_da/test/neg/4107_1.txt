A sound of thunder. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the greatest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a fantastic story. <br /> <br /> But what a huge movie! <br /> <br /> In Bradbury's science fiction short story, a company called Time Safari allows big hunters to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one is: Stay on the road, a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man steps out of the path and accidentally crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has changed drastically. Although there are paradoxes in any time history, Bradbury's tale was a quick jugular blow, a parable of the ripple effect. <br /> <br /> A Sound of Thunder was released in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science of fiction history all the time), illustrating Chaos Theory, Darwinism, and Butterfly Effect (which would only be produced in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's history, the flood of time travel was overshadowed by the company's greed, which was overshadowed by the deadly danger of humanity's existence itself. <br /> <br /> While in the movie, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a link of bad actors goes over and over to try to correct their error as an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful tale, except for the first push of the time traveling prehistoric hunting. Actual freedoms are taken with Bradbury's story - bavian-faced reptiles, plants that surpass Chicago's concrete, time-waving ripples through the city, CGI insectoids - which Bradbury had to sue the pants and underpants and the asshole from the filmmakers. <br /> <novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier were to launch a Big Balls Agency to believe they could actually add items to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys go in a straight line with balls so big? Ben Kingsley is the business owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad, it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his main hunter, Travis and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough in BRAVEHEART), the researcher with the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I may not be able to relate to the hundreds of thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialogue, but here is only one spoken by David Oyelowo as a kind of "scientist": he refers to the plejadine star cluster "The seven sisters, they look like stars, not they? But each one is a whole galaxy." Uh, no, idiot scientist, they are actually stars. <br /> <br /> The three morons that rewrote the history of Bradbury forgot that they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy. Or to write. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's breast that stretches toward her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses. - Review of Poffy The Agurk (for Poffy's Movie Mania).
