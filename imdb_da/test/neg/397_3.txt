This program was shown in an early morning slot at SPACE, a cable sci-fi station. I'm surprised someone would pay for this or send it out; It's incredibly amateurish. The whole show is a series of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a lot of circuit wallpaper on the wall. There is very little continuity between scenes and no plot. A typical scene is about a little lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. The dialogue does not make sense, and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all grown-ups, but I have literally seen better-set and set colleges. This program is embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps each scene will act as an interstitial; a filler between shows instead of advertisements. Stringing all the scenes together makes the material's limitations extremely obvious.
