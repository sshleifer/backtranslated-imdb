This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I have ever seen. It completely fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing stupid plot twists and reducing the 12 labors to ... 3 or 4 I think. It is totally superfluous to try to integrate other myths into clumsy ways that question the authors that they have ever read the myths, such as switching birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, Oraphs of Delphi to Tiresias and bulls to a pedant. version of Proteus, even integrative aspects, never seen outside of Sam Raimis entertaining series about his first marriage, to a woman with the Sami name of a Furies, so it sounds appropriate for the period. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of it, but it also fails entirely in clean film standards; The most painful is the dialogue, charged, portentous pseudo-Shakespeare triangles. It is a poor interpretation of the myths that make a tedious attempt at the kind of postmodern revisionism that Crichton's "The 13th Warrior" attempted with regard to Beowulf legend, while still incorporating the strictly mythological elements as distinct interference from the gods and magic superpower. . A sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who I am sure many of the quality actors involved are deeply sorry.
