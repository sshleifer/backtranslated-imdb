I rented this movie under the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest" and thought it was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another extremely ridiculous and all-horrible series of movies). However, I was not disappointed. It was just as terrible, if not worse, than what I had expected. I laughed the whole movie. Every piece of bad acting, badly shot and carved footage and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting. <br /> <br /> The special features include a pathetic view of the cast and the crew's six-month movie. <br /> Favorite line, "The sins of my ancestors! They have struck down to this moment!"
