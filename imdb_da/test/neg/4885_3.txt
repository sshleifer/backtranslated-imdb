I test myself to see 3 bad movies in a row to find out if you look at 3 bad movies in a row, can give me amnesia. I have a dubbed to English version of this movie. Let me now go down the points Music score: poor quality, but at least it fits the story: It's about a guy going to a city and he meets his sheriff brother, and they fight for farmers land from a big and he allies with Mexicans to drive them out and Trinity and his brother are trying to teach them to defend it - The final climate fight scene will confuse anyone about who they #### are the good guys Conclusion: better than I thought, but I have to continue with this i'm next will see Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme movie "Universal Soldier" ask for my beauty
