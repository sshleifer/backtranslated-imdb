Salena Incident is set in Arizona, where six prisoners of death are transferred from the state prison for reasons never explained while driving along the heavily armed prison bus, there becomes a flat and the driver has to pull away from the road. Then two blonde birds turn up and after the seduction, the incompetent prison guards disappear to get the better of the six prisoners released, but in a shooting their escape car is damaged and leaves them all stranded in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to go to the nearest town, Salena several kilometers away, and take the police with the hostage. When they reach Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely deserted with not another person in sight. They soon discover that the whole city has been killed by meat eating aliens, and they are firmly placed on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the United States on DVD and apparently with working title Terror Town This monstrous low-budget sci-fi horror flick was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redemption functions at all. Honestly, the Salena Incident is the kind of movie that gives movies a bad name. The movie can be roughly divided into two parts, the opening for forty or fifty minutes focusing on the prisoners in a thriller emotional opening, the guards and the flight, although it is rather poorly written and staged. The dialogue between the two blonde birds and the prison guards is so bad that it is unintentionally fun, as the two fitting birds speak the two not so appropriate prison guards. Funny stuff actually, unfortunately, the Salena Incident must be a sci-fi horror movie, not a comedy. As soon as the blasted downsides and their prison guards arrive at Salena, it goes into the sci-fi horror mode as foreigners turn up and start killing our clichéd character, which is good because they are annoying. See, the whole movie sucks, as it is poorly written, well thought out and made. I can't really be bothered to go into why, but believe me. Salena Incident is terrible at all levels. <br /> <br /> Being just a bad, boring and stupid movie. The Salena incident is also badly made. The set-scene action is horrible, foreigners look awful and never appear on the screen at the same time as the human character and as such it is sometimes difficult to tell what is happening. The special effects are also poor, foreigners look bad and the effects of the CGI computer are also quite terrible. The editing is poor, the cinematography is poor, the sets are cheap and everything is just an eye really. There are some gore, there are some shooting fires, one person is torn in half and one cut off is seen. Of course shot at a low budget Salena Incident has low production values ​​and looks cheap from start to finish. Filmed in Superior in Arizona. The play is horrible from no one I have ever heard of, even though the actor playing the female doctor is pretty beautiful. <br /> <br /> The Salena incident is a rubbish sci-fi horror movie that is terrible in just about any road, not worth 90 minutes of yours, mine or any other time.
