After a little over 50 years of eager film watching, I have got some simple rules to make good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your protagonists early, certainly within the first half hour 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. If you customize a novel, you combine characters and actions with less characters <br /> <br /> to a person 3. Make sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation 4. Keep the action free. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either 5. get the best music money can buy. Often it means something more than shopping, photography, etc. 6. Normally, if a movie is not so good within the first 10 minutes, it will not get better <br /> <br /> `Cannon for Cordoba 'is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've ever heard in a modest budget. This is quite surprising considering Bernstein's credentials ('Man with the Golden Arm' 'The Magnificent Seven' 'The Great Escape' 'Sons of Katie Elder'). Paul Wendko's direction is lacking and confusing. Performances range from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to awful (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the normally reliable George Peppard who falls somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script that break rules 1, 2 and 3. <br /> Don't waste your time. I give `Cannon for Cordoba 'a` 3'.
