I absolutely hated this movie. Although the film wanted to transmit a kind of social message, it was done in such a clich√©-ridden and melodramatic way as a Mexican soap opera. The play was also terrible, especially Charityn and her son. It's one of the issues with Dominican movies, they use celebrities who can't even act just to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive reviews here, which unfortunately mean that Dominicans are just disappointing in what has been done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself about quality.
