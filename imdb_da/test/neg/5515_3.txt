It took me a couple of years to hunt this title, a great booklet in my childhood. Almost every trip to the video store I would choose Space Raiders and see it three times each time my mom rented it for me. It was, I suppose, my Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a shame as it is such a stinker. My memories were so stupid that it didn't matter in terms of nostalgia, so I had to take it at face value. A crew of rump pirates kidnaps an eerie little child and uses the rest of the movie to try to get him home. <br /> <br /> Targeted just on the underwear, it has unwelcome slapstick, very whimsical costumes and make-up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and bad action. But even with the unintentional comedy, it is not fun to see it as an adult, where I can not only select the technical errors, but wonder how spectacular the author and director managed to botch an infinite stream of no-brainer fun / powerful moments Have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of some remote competent should have been successful. <br /> <br /> I imagine as a child, I probably found it quite empowering - there are many "I" can't do it, I'm just a kid "" Sure you can kiddo you have to just try! "- Write exchanges; the child drinks beer, etc., but even in low budget 1983 sci-fi standards, this is quite terrible, with a real snoozer of a" final ".
