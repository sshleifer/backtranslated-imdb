After the success of Star Wars, there was a boost in interest for Sci-Fi movies. This was one of the cheap attempts to deposit money quickly. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed (people not dinosaurs). Porn movie level plays. Cheap special effects, although time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them. Costumes were purely 1970s, which were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70s. I was expecting a disco to break out at any time. Nothing to really recommend in this movie.
