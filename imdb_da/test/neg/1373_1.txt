While the Mencia mind could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of Chappelel's show, it's really worse than that. First of all, Carlos Mencia is a jacket ** that is as fun as he is original, which doesn't say much. The show contains lame spoofs of American TV ads and political issues, and Mencia's "comedic" insight into politics adds to the low quality of this show. On top of that, mencia throws in more lame ethnic jokes and steals Jeff Foxworthy lines than I can count on on one side. while Carlos occasionally gets a cheap laugh, he uses the rest of the time to offend everyone in sight, which includes exploiting his own audience members. With the exception of the South Park, pulled together and Friday night stand-up, this exhibition marks the end of Chappelle's show glory days, which for those of you who have not heard were before going to Africa.
