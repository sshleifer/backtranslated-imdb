Lone Star Productions have probably knocked them out in the 1930s, and "Star Packer" has the feel of one of the more hasty ones. John Wayne is the American Marshal John Travers, investigating a crooked hoodlum, known only as "The Shadow", who is responsible for stealing cattle, stage holdups and the like, and gives orders behind the door to a fake masonry. Yakima Canutt is Travers' credible Indian sidekick, appropriately referred to as ... well, "Yak". Early on we find out that Cattlemens Union Head Matt Mattlock (George pre-Gabby Hayes) is really the Shadow; The dead giveaway is when he offers to buy his (supposed) niece's Anitas half of Matlock Ranch, as "this is no place for a girl". As Anita, Verna Hillie doesn't have much to do in the movie, although in a cartoon she continues to use a six shooter to blow one of the scales in one night scares the raid. <br /> <br /> There are a few curiosities in the movie - for once Wayne's character rides alternately a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the movie. In what could have been a nice unit, a hollowed-out tree stump is used by a hands located right in the middle of the street. And finally, the movie does not live up to the name since Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the film, that is, a star pack without a star. The horse is hunting, the current scene scenes, stagecoach off the cliff (another curiosity, the horses are conveniently loose from the stage) are all beautiful standard things. But John Wayne fans would like to see this one for the charisma he showed early in his career. For the more critical, the white carpets worn about the forehead of the good man can only mean that they all had headaches.
