My wife and I enjoy bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad they are good. Mansquito was one of them. One was bad, but it had some redeeming qualities. It makes you wonder how a self-respecting actor approaches lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" <br /> <br /> This is so bad that it has now taken its place as our standard for bad. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was coed strike force, the "Indian" who rode around in a black robe and used a sword to cry aloud. He shot down a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this movie, but there were no points where it was not pitiful. We could not make any redeeming features except one. It was the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no sign development, and no point on the movie. Someone in Hollywood should be fired.
