Seagal fans watch out - he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess. Instead, Seagal runs away from several battles so Ja Rule convincingly loses every fight. In fact, Ja Rule can be an up and coming action star, but Hollywood must let him at least hit puberty (which should happen in a few years ...) Also what kind of command / terrorist carries a slim midriff outfit? The chicken in this cruelty resembles a backup singer for Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal - When he finally cuts loose, it's his stunt-double (HAPPY PADDED to resemble the inflated Seagal) that does a lot of work and takes hold. Nor can I remember any aikido. It's just your standard kicks and beats you'll see in any direct-to-video martial arts turkey. Not even "so bad - it's fun," neither. Just plain boring ...
