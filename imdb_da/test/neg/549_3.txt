I was happy to find out that TCM showed this when I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This movie had a glowing Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but the appearance of others the movie more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding to the later movie. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to see, and you can't understand why his wife loves him. I found out after seeing the film that it was based on the stage play, where the 1992 film is based on the book. The original film also felt that it was an excerpt of a larger piece and felt incomplete. Too bad it was such an easy-down.
