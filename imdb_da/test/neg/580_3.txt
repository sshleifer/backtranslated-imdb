Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She continues to grow and grow. However, I have not registered any subtitles. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films from his ilk during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an unlucky computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who drives this computer, but Lou Costello! I like some of his movie with Bud Abbott. But even though this is a pretty bad movie, he does it fine without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil. <br /> <br /> Green plays the pompous city big shot. He's Provine's father. He intends to be elected mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having trouble, he dumps her. He doesn't dump her, but gives his fight against his long-standing admirer Costello. <br /> <br /> This is pretty incredible: Costello is the local waste collector. <br /> <br /> The special effects are minimal. And the sub-plot involving the military is paralyzed to the extreme.
