Loki, the Nordic god of evil, creates a mask that allows the wearer to have cartoon-like powers. On his father's, Odin's command, he uses the rest of the movie to look for the mask so that it cannot cause further grief for humanity. Meanwhile, the mask possesses a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Contract. If this sounds like a rather thin plot line, it is. In addition, the film is handled inappropriately from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you need to actively search for them. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the mask's son is presented at a pre-school's intellectual level, but in the face of scenes such as the mascot, urinating largely in six different directions, including on his father, this premium seems unlikely. I asked my son, whom he thought might have been the target audience for the movie, and he replied "persuaded criminals" who apparently forget the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> But just making a bad movie is not a sin, or hell would be crowded. What makes it a shame is that $ 72 million was spent on this piece of waste. To put things in perspective, the day after we saw Mask's son, my son and I saw "Good Night and Good Luck", a movie that won six academic award nominations (including Best Picture) and was filed for $ 7 million. It is true. Only one tenth of the amount of money spent on Mask's son. This is such a sin - rinsing good money into the sewer, as it could have been better used to make movie films or feeding starving children, or for that matter, almost any other purpose. The producers really have to be ashamed of themselves.
