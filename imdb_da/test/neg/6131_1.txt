Jesus Christ, what happened here? This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, how is it possible that they turned up a good idea for a movie. To tell you the truth, I was so hyped for this, even though it was like Blair Witch, but with actual alien creatures chasing camera guy. Goodies, I have been reduced to relaying this pile of sh * t quickly, and I never do that while watching movies. The high rating here on IMDb makes me believe that the actual aliens give 10s for this piece of scream. Invasion is about good, an invasion. The movie starts by saying that everything you are seeing is real, blahblahblah. Then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if I need to believe they can enjoy this movie. Next thing you know I see the most boring car driving ever filmed, in a forest at night, thinking of you. Is it a movie or a Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes are all dull dialogues between the police while you see grass and a straight road with flashlight. Where the hell were foreigners?! They slept of course! Then we learn that bad plays are not only reduced to high schools, as the policeman behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was "nightfishing" and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him? Out of nowhere do we see the 'nightfishing' guy who goes like a zombie. The police are apparently too stupid to note that something is wrong with this man. Apparently, he was actually stupid when the zombie / alien guy injects into the police ears a form of alien parasite, thus changing him to a stranger. Then the police / alien go back in his car, looking for a young couple who had sex a while back in the forest, get them, change the guy to a stranger, and then the girl runs to the policeman's car and escapes. If this quick plot introduction didn't get it in the head that this movie was bad, then the next 40 minutes would. Watching this movie is as painful as repeating yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, while it might sound interesting on the back of the DVD box, is badly fixed and unfortunately we are back with another boring straightforward to DVD cruelty. The only thing that kept me awake was constant flashing and loud sound effects (regrettable). If we see the same forest trail for 63 minutes, it is not enough that we have to endure crappy flashing techniques to "scare" the viewer and constantly complain about a bad actress who grows old and annoying, quite fast. <br /> <br /> If you feel you should rent this, I tell you why? There are better Scifi / Horror movies out there. Even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snips is more entertaining than this. For the love of all good things you must not bother with his shed. My eyes blew, and for the first time I wanted suicide. A 1/10, avoid this as a disease.
