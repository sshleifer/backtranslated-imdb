If one were to return to the beginning of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was a comedian actor trained on the legitimate step, not a performance raised in the purgatory of music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that matched his image. In addition, his "silent" movie from 1924 had incorporated sequences based on soundtracks lost to the audience (for example, the bell sequence of Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the apse sequence of THE KID BROTHER). Nevertheless, Lloyd's sound functions were consistently on the cashier's office when the news of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never understood that the glass character's enemy was not sound, but the great depression. Depression audiences who are wise with optimism may have rooted this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression crowd despised him as the person who is likely to cut off their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Comparing this problem with character selection is Lloyd's view as an infinitely happy handler. Sincerity is, of course, a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing downward and outward. Perhaps it is because he feared to return to that state permanently. CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but only suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scientists believe that Lloyd was asked to make this film because he saw the FDR presidential election as a dictatorship that bent on tearing the rich and softening on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed this day and age, a propoliti state drama the previous year. We must also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protocols and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it dealt with fascism easily in a "comedy" and because its release was particularly bad, as there were events in Germany in that year. The 1934 production code would ultimately limit the glorification of vigilant justice and confirm the rule of the constitutional law as cumbersome as it may be. The idea of ​​the benevolent despot, the well-meaning almighty leader who brings a utopia once freed from the control and balance of this omnipotence, dates to the classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the democratic experience of the country of origin, shows that FDR's America was probably enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union or Mussolini's Italy. But can you laugh at the gallows humor of awaiting fascism? Lloyd's uneven movies are skewed to the right and may have been written by Dr. Goebbels himself, if of course he had a sense of humor. It is an alternative story where a select restores order and lost honor to every need, and does it with good nature and fun. Of course, the impending fascism, which faces to the left, is Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This last film has the advantage of being put in another country and based on a thinly blurred actual person and event. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it underestimated the scale of evil man, but it succeeds in spite of its obscure and inappropriate speaking because it has the special advantage of being justified by history. However, Lloyd must be credited for two things: First, he also made no further pro-fascist films or produced later hypocritical films during the war. Second, he never sold TCP to TV. The world after 1945 had seen the face of fascism, and it was not entertaining.
