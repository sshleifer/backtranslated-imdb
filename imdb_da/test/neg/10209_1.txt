No Holds Barred is a movie that must never be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore as a serious movie. See more the way you plan 9 from outer space. They are one in the same because they are both so bad they are funny. The fun moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones not to be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as he can only play them) grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first encounter with Brell (Kurt Fuller) hilarity follows, and that's part of the movie that every person should see. It can be the funniest scene I ever swear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, how someone thought this movie would make money, I will never know, and that person will probably be beaten for submission. I hope they were at least fired. This movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale, and one is only for the accidental fun parts.
