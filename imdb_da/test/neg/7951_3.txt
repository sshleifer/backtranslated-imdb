Have you ever seen a movie when, in my opinion, your left was considering what the world was all about? Well, hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story is complex or anything like that, it's just that it plays out in three completely different modes ... 1. A funny 60's drug movie ... 2. A very overplayed soap opera ... and 3. a horror girl (with very little to "scream" about). Much to my surprise, I found out that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I must have the best to learn through trials and mistakes. <br /> <br /> Would like to play something from H.G. Lewis (only with less eg), this "bad" movie has that perks. Mostly shorter time, there is a beautiful cool jazz score to be heard, and there are a few memorable scenes ... one of them is where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motorcycle ride to the zoo. The camera tricks instructor uses to indicate their hallucinatory condition is just retarded, but entertaining. Believe in me when I tell you that you do not have to run out of the house to catch this!
