I can't believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is strangely bad. If 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without any idea that the story was filmed by the other directors, it is basically the result I would expect. I also think some of the scenes were broken out of order - things don't always seem to be moving in order. The film seems like we should already know about half of the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg is trying to make manic, a-la-Robin Williams comedy in this movie. Ewww. And the whole prerequisite for putting an ex-con in charge of a bunch of children does not seem realistic in this day and age.
