I spent a year in Iraq and among the hundreds of movies I've seen here was this little gem called the Vampire Assassin. Judging from the cover (African-American with grain-rows with curved blade, leather jacket and decoration of a badass) I expected a Blade rip-off. Fair enough. <br /> <br /> So I slip it in and observe a cross-over overweight African-American without a knife, no cornrows and well, nothing at all except ... I don't know. If you have read any of these other reviews, you get the core of the girl. It stinks. Bath. Really bad. I don't know if it was the Highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire or karate-kick sound effects for camera zooming or the $ 20 budget on props or "OK, we have 90 minutes to film this before we stay caught in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot "or the martial arts that are as exciting and fast as two old people have sex or the 7th grade talent or the eccentric Asian master who is either senial or sour, or what, but the film manages to Forcing you to question your existence. And it's great. <br /> <br /> Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like Scanners. If you heckle (or MST3K) with your friends, that's what is for you. I've seen it three times already, and I think it could have caused permanent damage to my psyche. If you still have no idea about the quality of the movie, people tried to give it away for free and no one would take it. Not even with power. <br /> <br /> Long story short, see it. Either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will rock your skull (and for most of all the wrong reasons).
