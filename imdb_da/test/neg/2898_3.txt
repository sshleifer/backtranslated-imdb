"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it is still a very bad movie. It will hardly delight the fans of martial arts films because there is not enough action, but even the action scenes are often spoiled by ridiculous profits and excess violence. As if the film was not already weak enough, filmmakers shift parts of it to an idiotic "The Exorcist" rip-off. The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actor playing the "dominated" heroine; She is a beautiful and athletic woman whom the director does not forget to exploit in various shabby ways - she happens to be an aerobic teacher. I do not mind the exploitation of a small soft core, but it must not be something else.
