I've seen worse movies. This is bad, but at least it does not try to be good, so it deserves a short applause. It is firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> It's a rubbish movie, but in a good way and it's definitely worth buying if it's in the buyer at your local supermarket. Terrible charming rather than just plain horrible. The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to save her. When she turns up, she exclaims "Bunnyfluff!" who pulls snails from his co-pilot. <br /> <br /> Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!
