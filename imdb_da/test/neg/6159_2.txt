This movie was strange, mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to an evil wind that makes the Earth's surface almost uninhabitable when it blows, but it didn't seem to have anything to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely bad rip-off of Bladerunner, ie. rogue android is being chased by bounty hunts (or ruthless policeman in this). Luke Skywalker becomes a surprisingly good performance as the aforementioned rogue cop, nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find any of the substance of the android or what his intentions are. There is an enchanting scene where Bill Paxton (who has kidnapped the android) plays a certain song in his paper flight without any particular reason (the song is "Shape of Things," by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene, where the same song is played without apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don't think so.
