It may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew it was a B movie before I saw it (it was actually the reason to watch it), but I never thought it could be that bad. The title promises Dracula in the room and delivers, but the story makes no real use of the fact that Casper van Diens character is a descendant of Van Helsing. And beware of the end of the movie, it comes to you quickly. I have never seen an end cry "And now we are over budget!" in a clearer way. Their resolution of the movie was pretty comic, but the story had obviously painted itself in a corner. If you feel you need to see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If I didn't, I wouldn't have made it to the end.
