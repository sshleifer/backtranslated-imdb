Pretentious claptrap, update of Herman Melville (!) About a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother, who is being transferred to his far-lost sister who has been engaged by gypsies. Or something like that ?? not that anyone really cares about digging up his multilayer plot covered in pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly repeats passers-by on the street until she is anonymously killed a rock group's deaf music used in demolition of old buildings). Considering the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least comes to bathe in the nest), I expected much more from this one; apparently there is an even longer TV version of POLA X out there?
