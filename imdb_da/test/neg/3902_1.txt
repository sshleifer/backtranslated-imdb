Wow, umm this was a lot how to say, other type of movie. It calls itself a comedy ... but it wasn't really laught in a funny way at all. It was insane. If you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a global disaster, why not 4? or 5? ..... and why did it suddenly end without something happening ??? They could have done this much better just by having another element in the plot as a dumpy woman to the ugly guy or something ....... zinc, ridiculous .... ahh <br /> <br /> I dunno .. see it ... it wasn't that bad ..... sorta fun at times .... i guess ... schneider
