Don't waste six hours in your life and see it as I did. The fact that I did, is not a very good reflection on me. The only redeeming play in this clunker was by Wes Studi. How a 'prequel' with similar roots can't even be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove is beyond me !! It was a contradictory, wandering, incoherent story. Plot lines were not developed, action scenes were almost ridiculous and the big end (disappointment) was an appropriate end to this mini-series. Val Kilmer, whom I have thought of as a recognized actor, played one of the strangest roles I have ever seen him in. His last scene in the show should have been a filler of the director. I've read these reviews for years and this show asked me to sign up !!!
