Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are a few cheerful, murderous aliens who are stranded on the ground and stumbled across a small western city. They become deputy sheriffs and dish out a deadly form of justice for faster, murderers, and others while coming on the bad side of some of the locals (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, their sexy aliens daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) comes in a skimpy / shiny outfit with his black human husband (Christopher M. Brown) to find them, and television reporters and government agents are getting ready to fill the time. <br /> <br / From what I can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western ...) in a movie, and what a stupid, eerie mess it is, despite energetic action from the two stars. The script is pretty scary.
