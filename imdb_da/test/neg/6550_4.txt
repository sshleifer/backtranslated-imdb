This movie is about people who live on a trailer park. Later in the film it becomes obvious that these people are out of work comedians, mostly old men. Well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f *** ing. But never is there any action, just the people who speak. In the beginning I thought it was some cool perverted redneck stuff, but after a while it became boring. I mean how many versions can you think of saying f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? It may be fun - for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes. But it was fun to see those trying to act. I'm pretty sure they often read their text on a few sheets when they play. but it does not interfere with the movie, it is cool like this. because these individuals seem so poor, that the style fits perfectly. their wood, helpless reading of the lyrics makes a pretty good mood, I fell in love with the characters a little. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Later in the film, f *** er makes some comedy shows (rhyme about f *** ing) with only himself as the audience and imagined applause. Then you get an expulsion advice, and then they decide to defend the trailer and into their roof - armed with some weapons. then they were shot. fin. sounds like action, but it is not. It just takes some dirty home camera. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> But the movie is completely consistent in its style, and I'm pretty sure it's just what the filmmaker wanted to have. It is the portrait of the f ** k-ups in a groggy home-camera style with characters that cannot act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to see. But the texts about - you know what - all the time become boring after a while. <br /> <br /> Beautiful young director who also seems like an interesting person when he played some teenagers in popular movie / TV shows but now came in several horror movies, which is more his cup of tea I guess . And this will be his first directional effort distributed by Troma now. I don't know about a release, I got this as a "pre-screener" from this year's cannes, saying "for booting only".
