I was spoken to seeing this by a girlfriend. John was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looking good without shirt on !! I thought it was a love story about both of them, but it was primarily about his reactions to her letters. Savannah was a sympathetic character at the start of the movie, but when she dumped him, I lost respect for her. She said it tore apart, was away from him, and it was difficult - he was a million miles away, he killed people, and the only contact he got was through her letters !!! She didn't have a hard time, she had family and money and he had a tour of duty !! I was so frustrated at the end when he forgave her - he was too much of a girlfriend. I would have waited those 3 years and greeted him home with open arms.
