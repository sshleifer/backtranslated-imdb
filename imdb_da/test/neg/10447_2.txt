I was enticed to see Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad, but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I am happy that I had the opportunity to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. It's appearance is decent, and that's the only thing that saves this movie from getting a 1 (I gave it a 2). The action is incredibly poor and the dialogue is just as regrettable. I don't expect much, but I was constantly surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is a kind of biologist or scientist or something I was not really aware of. He goes down with this submarine's usable crew to find out what happened to this underwater station, which the shark took out of course. By this way, all the scenes that show that someone is working underwater are not underwater. First of all, if they just go down to find out what has happened to this station, what's with all the big quiet darts and harps and things. Are these things that you normally carry with you when examining an accident. The Shark Theory was advanced by Antonio while you were on the road, so it was not as if they were going to know what they were against. Antonio and this young college student, horrible actress, by the way, just jump to the suben control when the bottom is in trouble. What about it? Unless everyone gets some kind of education before going to high school, I find it a little stupid. The director seems to think that if crew members work in the background, it is a good idea to put someone in the weld in the background. Metal crafts are very important when your on one under I guess. Anyway I could go on, but I've already said too much. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and destroy it. Then send email and ask IMDB to remove all recordings of this movie from their site. All memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do that if we work together.
