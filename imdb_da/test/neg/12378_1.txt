This is a horrible movie !! Some people told me it wasn't that bad, but I totally disagree! The monster is incredibly cheap (and fun) looks, but that's something we all knew I guess. Besides that, the dialogues are terrible, and the writing is simply horrible. <br /> <br /> As bad as this movie is as the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the good reasons, but it's a good "so bad it's fun" flick. By the way, there is nothing like "La Castagne". According to a secondary character in the film Pierre (described in the film as French Canadian), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian myself, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It made me laugh though ... :))
