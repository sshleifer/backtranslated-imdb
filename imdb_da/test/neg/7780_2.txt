The problem with this movie is that it is not fun, it is not scary, it is not dramatic, it is not exciting, it is not stimulating, it is not, it is not exciting, it is not It is not even the smallest bit interesting. I watched this movie recently on tape and I was glad I didn't use the money to rent it. It's basically a bad attempt at film making. I don't even want to disturb the story. History? What story?
