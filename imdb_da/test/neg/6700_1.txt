Badland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time it is fine and I can continue with my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the Iraq War, I feel it necessary to say that the story, plot, play, and depiction of what soldiers go through at home were pure waste. It was as if the director / writer / who locked on anything clich√© about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it. Not to mention, I would imagine that there was absolutely no research into this film. The "Marine" uniform looked like it was fresh from a shelf and was a pattern that was not used since the first Iraqi war. I don't want to continue forever, it's a horrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
