The perfect 6-step recipe for a dull middle of the road movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Take a burnt out, outrageous ex-cop with a bad attitude, but also a sensitive touch (clothing concert pianist with a cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some "cool" retro gadgets like a beat-up Porsche 356, a roaring bike, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles; <br /> <br /> 3. In a few free-spirit places, eg a trendy ocean-side apartment and a dedicated dining box for an office; <br /> <br /> 4. Spice it up with "deep" socio-romantic themes, such as a post-divorce-traumatized-but-final-re-ex-wife, a secret admiration-and-therefore-forgiving waitress, a pair-of-former-colleague-cops-only-one-of-who-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-mate-get-iced-over-a-suit-full-of-illegal - $$$; $ br /> <br /> 5. Let it boil for approx. 90 minutes in a "quick" but not necessarily logical or internally uniform order of mediocre action scenes, cheap sore moments and sluggish clever cracks. <br /> <br /> 6. Serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep right through it or something a little more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do!).
