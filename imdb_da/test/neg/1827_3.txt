This is a beautiful miserable picture. It gives nothing unique or original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is involved in macabre medical experiments. And of course she gets involved in solving the strange deaths at school. This movie started promising with a few cold special effects where a guy is partially dissected while he is alive and trying to get away after he wakes up, but even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are beautiful routine plastic models of The human body and the unreal gaze of blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the miserable spectacle were not enough, this movie had subtitles that many times did not match the doubly English that you hear being spoken and then adding it to the mouth movement that Don't match the dubbing. well let's just say trying to coordinate everything in your head is not worth it for this mediocre movie. <br /> <b r /> I at least counted on some skin in this movie and, except for a little under the opening credits, this film didn't deliver it either. <br /> <br /> This is a boring routine operation of the mill horror / gore movie --- short on horror and gore. Ship this movie unless "Ernest goes to Camp" is the only rental back.
