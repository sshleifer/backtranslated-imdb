This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same thing I got when I finished watching this movie: "Uff? OK, it ended what a relief!" I felt pain watching this movie so bad it was! It's a B-series low-cost movie that's safe, but I don't think it's an excuse to be so bad! I have seen fantastic low-cost movies with great plot, good production, great play and most of all some fabric! This one has none of it! The reason is hilarious, it almost seems like an "American guide to how to transform ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie where some children play with the occult"? I don't know if the Chinese story in this movie is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! The production is just awful, a pure zero (what "special effects" are they?). There is no tension. The supposed "voltage scenes" are a complete failure. The action is no better; and what about the dialogues? Oh God! A movie that has several dialogues, like: "I want to pass there later, OK? Is that okay?" OK okay. "OK?" OK, okay, goodbye then "I'm sure it deserves no more than a 1/10 score! <br /> <br /> Too bad to be true!
