A few of my co-authors have covered the movie's album elements so I will stick to some of the cuff anchors ... <br /> <br /> 1. This is entertaining - but not for the reasons you believe. It's cheesy, but it can still be seen. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Dania's love interest should be about thirty. The Christian girl whom Dan ignores is much shorter. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole his shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my host's angel looks like Muriel, I must apply for transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Okay ... so apparently ... Dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! What kind of horrible guilt is it? Muriel says it was Dan's prayers that kept her parents together. I just thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way they stay together is if they decide to do it. <br /> <br /> 5. I will echo the atheist's comments on how this film portrays non-Christians. Apparently they are all Slovenian bullies. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. He gives the film a little bit of credibility, even though he is the only one. He mostly keeps this film on his own.
