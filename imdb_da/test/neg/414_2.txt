I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong, it hurts. Attempted to look with an open mind, but if you are going to dive into a movie or something about this matter, at least do some lessons on history, locations, church protocol, etc. Stop playing for the stupid audience, thank you. There are those of us out there who actually put on our shoes and wake up to the theater when something of this kind worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. A little research, all I ask. But then again, the book on which it is based is something of a joke in itself. So basically they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it a manuscript, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and get an incredibly promoted world distributed theater release and in no time has anyone taken the time to Do a little research on much of it. I know several of my colleagues who would have done so only for the credit alone or at least given it to a group of students as a task for several weeks to investigate various aspects ?? Or just pay some skilled a few bucks just to run through it because you trust there are lots of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.
