The first users comments are very detailed for a very vague film. Not to say I disagree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To get right to that point, it looks pretty much like making a really bad amateur porno flick. There are a few fun points in the movie, but with the kind of things that happen in today's youth's everyday life, it's actually kind of shame. The main role of the film is a pompous jackass, and both the guy and the girl in the movie are far too modest to be in a movie like this. DO NOT PLAY YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they at least used a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and ultimately you got almost full frontal nudity from the girl, that's what it is the only thing worth watching. end
