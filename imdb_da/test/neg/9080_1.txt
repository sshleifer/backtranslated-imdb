This is one of the few films - perhaps the only one - that really haunted me for years. It was the first I had ever seen people tortured, so much so that the blood flowing from their mouths from grabbing their teeth and screams, etc. It was brutal; the worst I had ever seen in movies. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen in movies and I've seen thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never see this movie again, nor would I recommend it. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If you see people tortured, not your idea of ​​fun, then stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know there are many sick people out there, many of them professional film critics who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick story. It's still a "B" movie with stupid dialogue and some wood that appears by Charles Bronson. This is not one of his better efforts. Although it was, so many terrible scenes would not be seen here. Trust me on this one.
