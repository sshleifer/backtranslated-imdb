I know everyone said that this movie was completely crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was bad. I recommended they not see it. But when it came on TV, we saw the ad. I turned to the family and said, "I know it's sad, but I'm thinking of seeing it." My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, I too." And you know what? It was fun. <br /> <br /> It is by no means a good movie. It's definitely a waste of time. But it's a good waste of time. You might still think it's scary and fair enough, but I thought it was a really fun slapstick comedy. I didn't like a few, like when the fish was hit by the car, but apart from that I thought it was good. I loved sitting there and selecting all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald etc. <br /> <br /> So if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, see a drama or something.
