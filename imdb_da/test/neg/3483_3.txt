This movie is a great stereotype. The actor (except Philbin & Harrison) is horrible, and the horrid script only makes things worse. I have to agree with another review that the "local" characters sound ridiculous as a fact, so do the "Caucasian" characters. 3 stars out of 10 for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) surf scenes. (1/2 * out of ****) See "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for Hawaii done right, especially BP, which I thought was entertaining and brilliant.
