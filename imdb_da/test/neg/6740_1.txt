The foreigner is a straight-to-video Steven Seagal movie, originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in March 2003, an intention allegedly reversed when Seagal's former movie (Half Past Dead) refueled at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a sumptuous $ 20 million budget, including spot bonuses in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the study's commitment to a two-image deal that was negotiated after the relative success of exit wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had a solid feel. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of their investment, Sony Screen Gems certainly made the right move in celebrating this movie. It's almost incomprehensible. What do I say? It is incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was going on at all, except the very broad terms. <br /> <br /> Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy. Other mysterious guys are trying to stop him. Other very mysterious guys are trying to kill the moderately mysterious guys trying to stop him. Others really, really mysterious guys especially do mysterious things that everyone was actually too mysterious for me to figure out. The mysterious wife of the intended mother tries to pick up the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Because he is a self-proclaimed "accomplished professional" who has been hired to deliver the package only in the hands of the man, Seagal initially neglects the wife and later becomes involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with inexplicable agendas as well. as from her husband. Many people have mysterious, cryptic conversations. Many people blow each other's brains out. Some guys seem to die more than once, while other scenes end with battles without a clear picture of the result, so the audience sees someone die, but is not sure which of the warriors are going to boot. Allegiances often change and add additional mystery. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I don't know who was on whose side or what anyone really wanted, and the decision was as unsatisfactory as the show. At the end of the movie I just sat and thought, "It's the end, what ...?" <br /> <br /> I couldn't even figure out the credits. IMDb says Aussie's actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this movie, but I'll be damned if I know where. Either she was left on the floor room, or she was wise about the project. She might have found some activities more beneficial for her career, such as having unnecessary surgery, tearing off the annoying insert cards or taking some community course training in animal husbandry. Seagal used to be a beautiful fair hand-to-hand combatant, but the action scenes failed to redeem this movie at all. Seagal is in his 50s now and is a very big man, so he's reduced to a minimal physical effort, and even in it he is in a knee-length coat to hide his thumbs fire-wicked circumference. He can even get a little wind to remove the wraps from the candy bars, although it is understandable if you estimate just how many of them he should eat to maintain his current circumference. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal seemed to make a comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last movie was half dead, it should be pretty close to filling the other half.
