I bought this out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) perform in a movie made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused movies, recordings that are likely to be on a shelf for ten years can be! You can tell because the movie stores used to shoot their scenes do not match the movie used to record "Jack-O". Ed Woods curse continues. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is just the kind of movie you would expect to find on both of their film films. The same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some sort of curse is released when stupid, beer-guzzling teens disturb a grave. The result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (that?) Goes after the healthy Kelly family for revenge (and kills others coming in the way). The father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The son (Ryan Latshaw, the director's son) has a continuous, confused facial expression for all of his scenes and a hilarious ill-acted dramatic scene in a tomb. In any case, he is a child. The mother's eyes jump out of her head as she descends to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who turns out to explain things that seem to try to pronounce phonetically all her dialogue. <br /> <br /> So what about the names of the actors? You can see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell cards on a TV screen (they are used to covering time). Linnea has a larger role as a babysitter, and she does exactly what she can with it. Her enthusiastic performance helps a little. There's also one out of nowhere laugh when an ultra-conservative couple watching a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bites it. The woman slides on a blanket and sticks a toaster with a knife. She is electrocuted and the end result resembles a flame-broiled Muppet. <br /> <br /> All and all really entertaining stuff! I'm not bored!
