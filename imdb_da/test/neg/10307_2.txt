I love this show. I saw every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I'm tuning in to see tonight, and for some reason I see you've retooled this great show. And you've taken what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show away as were the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also love the other characters, but they are good in small nozzles like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying hard to fill out. It's overdose. While things are fun in small nozzles when exposed to it all the time, it goes from fun to annoying. I looked forward to the return of this show. So please bring back the charm. Although you could not fit Piper into the show, at least bring Lizzy back. But I loved the girls. They brought fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his business life and dealing with his personal life and friends too. It was the charm. And the big dog too. <br /> <br /> I hope that the network (FOX) forced the authors to do this and the authors did not willingly make it to the show. I will give the show a few more episodes before I give up, but last night's episodes were bad. I made a great deal out of the show that came back tonight and had people over and I felt like a fool because no one laughed except 2-3 times. I apologized to them and said I didn't know what happened. And about 10 minutes into the episode, I realized they shouldn't show Piper or Lizzy, and it was no longer a must see television comedy.
