It has been said that some directors make small budget images, look like blockbusters. Albert Pyun makes small budget images, similar to high school A / V project films. This film was largely lacking in all departments. Almost all scenes draw too much, the "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, Rob Lowe seems to be scruffy with acting as well, and the poor killing of Euro-pop numbers stops the movie for a dead stop. On the plus side, Burt Reynolds does a good job with what he gets (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent, and Ice-T puts another of a long new series of B-movie gangsters. Not Pyun's worst work (Urban Menace), but certainly not his best (Mean Guns).
