I got this movie as a purchase you get a deal on troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a dual feature with that movie. I didn't really know what Actium Maximus was at that time, and when I saw the trailer, I was scared. It looked terrible. But hello, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, I could seem to tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sense to me. The special effects were so terrible that you cannot tell what is in God's name. I understand Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but come on. And it's boring, because in the interview he sounds like this should be an epic movie and meant more than you could see. But it is unfortunately to see the movie one of the most boring hours and 15 minutes of everyone's life. It is so completely painful to sit through. I really can't even explain the plot to you because I didn't understand it at all and unfortunately I've seen this movie twice! Apparently, they used some kind of dolls for the "alien dinosaurs" as they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can't stress enough. And most of the time there are bad special effects, but this movie needs them badly. It goes on a futuristic plane, where alien dinosaurs fight each other and bad actors in panties run around, and they look as if they are in a joke. And some boxes with a blue light on it are the president. I know in the interview Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot, yes, I can see why it didn't make it to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. The music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that holds its head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is as always fun. Overall, don't waste your time, but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!
