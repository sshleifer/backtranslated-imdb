There is potential in there with "Tell No-One". A curious and exciting plot, and a French takes a very American story. But for me the possibilities were not exploited here. <br /> <br /> Although I liked aspects of this movie, there were three prominent errors that drew it right down to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First, it's a stupid, clich√©d murder mystery. A particularly gifted murder she wrote or Bergerac. Being French does not eliminate this problem - it is just stupid and in French at the same time. It's filled with incredible coincidence. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the transition from the US to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor hangs out on the "streets" of a French city with his new "homies" and their blingin 'SUVs ... and then comes the car chases ... <br /> <br /> But thirdly and For the most part, it's just too darn long. For me, a movie has a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes, and over two hours takes a serious reason. This time it didn't.
