Leon Errol handles his dual role as Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I have problems with the "Mexican Spitfire" series because they are all designed to produce wrong identities, and they are telegraphed in advance. Errol is fun as the heavy Lord Epping, but I would have preferred much more joke and much less repetition. <br /> <br />
