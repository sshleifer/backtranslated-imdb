"Death Wish 3" is the movie equivalent to a shooting game. All the characters (except Bronson's Paul Kersey, of course) exist only to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the bad guys). The director simply beats the mindless violence (people are even burned alive and burst), making this an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely has trouble protecting himself from the enemy ceasefire). Fans of this short thing (and apparently there are many) will enjoy it, others .... beware. (* 1/2)
