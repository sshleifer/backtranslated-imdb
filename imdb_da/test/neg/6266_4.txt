Food scientist Professor Tabani drinks a potion he has brewed up in his lab but turns into a blood-demanding vampire instead. When Dr.Aqil visits a visit, Tabani sees a picture of Aqil's wife Shabnam and after turning Aqil into a vampire, he leads Shabnam to make her his brother. Akil's brother discovers the vampire's tomb and his brother in Tabanias castle and kills his brother with a knife to release his soul. Tabab succeeds in biting Shabnam and once turned to try to lure her young niece away.Aqil's brother runs toward the time to stop the vampire path. "Zinda Laash" almost puts me in bed. The plot is extremely slow, but more or less follows Bram Stoker's famous novel. The excitement is completely absent as it is Gore and Nudity. The movie is only recommended for curious horror fans who want to watch the second horror movie made in Pakistan (after "Madman" from 1964).
