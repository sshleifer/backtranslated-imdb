I would like to say that I went to this movie with my expectations too high. I thought it was fun because it is the successor of Bruce Almighty who was really fun and it's stars Steve Carell, an excellent comedian, but boy, sucked it. <br /> <br /> The film is announced as a sequel, but it really has nothing to do with the original, as the only people who represent their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but Steve's character is quite different, he is No longer the dumb he was in the first here, he's a nice guy. The story is different and the actors are different and it is not fun. <br /> <br /> All actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent, but none of them seem to use it. And it looks like the movie just for the money. Now, of course, the plot is shaped by Noah's history, but there are so many wrong things with it I don't know where to start. I think the big problem is that in everyone around Evan he thinks he is crazy despite all the things that happen to him, he grows a big white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all over the world he builds A huge bow in a couple of weeks, in fact, people would not mock this guy for what they would say he is the new Noah. <br /> <br /> Also, the special effects are good, but what the hell is the biggest movie flood ever filmed doing in Evan Almighty? Should they really waste such great special effects as filler for this crappy movie. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy as he has stayed away from three of the worst successors ever made, Son of Mask, Dum and Dumber and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a huge disappointment and Tom Shyadac was ashamed of himself.
