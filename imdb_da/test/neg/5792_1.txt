This movie hurt my face. I don't understand ... things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone blowing into a song and dance song. I don't understand how people can boast this movie with praise. There are B-movies, and then there are B-musicals, and then there is Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me run my head in a wall. The only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video that facilitates the pain but still does not justify why it should exist. The most frightening part of the movie is Toni Basil's creepy dance that comes with her strange song. But on the bright side she can find the notes she is looking for, unlike the pop music experiences Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say tone deaf. So if you want to ask life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, buy it.
