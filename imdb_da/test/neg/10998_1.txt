If you like really shocking movies, this is for you. The play is the worst I have ever seen, and the story goes by. If you come across this movie in your video store, don't even consider borrowing it. The chicken on the front is not even the one in the movie. I gave this movie 1/10 only because I couldn't vote 0. Avoid it at all costs.
