It is just when a band tour and only has an original member. It's not the same as the classic line up. All new players play the lead role in Rag, Scotty, etc., with Ashby being basically the only recurring face from the first movie. And he was only less aware of the first flick who served as the only redeemable group of the three guys Scotty tried to help meet women. The film is poorly written, with the stupid dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie this is a turkey. Not even low-budget 80's movie fans don't want to die through this movie, which has no plot and lots of bad plays. This movie would have been better without being released. Just pretty bad.
