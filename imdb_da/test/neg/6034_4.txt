this movie is pretty bad, aggressive, not played well, not good, seems low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and interrupted. After seeing previous comments, went to see it, but if you try to compare it with apocalypse now, PLATOON or others, you are really away from the tracks. This movie looks like a 60-year-old and purely made movie with the cast of cultured Neanderthal, not to mention (or actually do), without paying attention to details such as changing rounds, low budget fireworks and all kinds of poorly filmed characteristics. can be seen, however, if you want to see it as an early development of the movie document .. not to go back !! <br /> <br /> p.s - the boys are okay.
