I stared like Eugene Morris Jerome in my high school adaptation of the drama, and this movie certainly does not live on Neil Simon's script or fantasy. I know this game backwards and forwards, and I can honestly tell you that the play was off. Production was cheesy. The changes in the player's script were poorly executed. If you really want to enjoy this game, you should see the actual game, not a Hollywood movie adaptation. The Eugene character lacked soul and was too sarcastic in everything he said. The other characters were also off. A general disappointment, messy, disloyal to the game, amateurishly done!
