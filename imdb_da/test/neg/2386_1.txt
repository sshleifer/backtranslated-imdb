"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that formal small budget films that strive for less may seem worse, but I would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formal "indie" movie pretending to be more is worse. <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never come back the 91 minutes of my life that I wasted on his movie. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the manuscript has failed to deliver an anti-hero or wholly moral core that the audience wants to see succeed or fail. <br /> <br /> In the story of history, the three dramatic conflicts are man to man, man vs world and man vs self. The play focuses on a group of colleague friends in New York and is concerned with human dynamics vs. themselves, where each of the film's characters is so self-absorbed in a depression of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies for the audience's very eyes. <br /> <br /> Each of the protagonists spoils inexplicable bad behavior (heroin addiction without history of why the sign is an abuser, a fiance who has sex with her fiance / investor, even though the sign is written too wisely to have sex with such a fun person, a man who begins as a decent guy, but is attracted by a creepy investor and converts for some unknown reason to a similar foul-mouthed business jackass, a closeted chubby homo cyber geek who does nothing but finds dates online and a gay asian man who dies an HIV positive elderly man but has no scenes on why the relationship works and why love develops). Critical scenes Creating the cause of the character's addiction, the fiancé and self-confident fiancé who could explain why she would sleep with a sleazy bag; The background that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" type of character and become a jackass; a narrative line for the lumpy cyber geek; and several scenes of interaction between the Asian man and the HIV-positive girlfriend lack all. <br /> <br /> Without proper detail creation, all character actions are forced and constructed. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE <br /> <br /> I found Mr. Johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view and left the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /> <br /> At best, the camera can be described as everyday. Mr. Johnson chose small spaces to shoot and failed to capture the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic movie that considered the recording of a stage play and not a movie. The result was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. I suppose Mr. Johnson is to blame when he could have asked for full score to increase understanding in each shot. CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" is an annoying and unmitigated fiasco in filmmaking.
