The plot's unreasonability has been noticed by several commentators, especially the huge amount of problems Fr McKenna would have had to go to and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he might have done, including that Langdon should decipher each link in minutes. McKenna is labeled; a few seconds later he gives orders, and a few minutes later he runs (literally) in charge of operations - in fact he would be in shock. And as usual in thrillers, the killer does not kill the heroes and, as his only lame explanation, kills them not on the list of those to be killed as if any other innocent criminal he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly horrible movie (US President commands jets and beats foreigners, haha), and this effort runs close. For such an unlikely movie, angels and demons contain a remarkable number of predictable events. Who did not hire knowing when the murderer went to get his reward in Volkswagen? I want to shout: "You are blown up". Who didn't know that the heroine should find a body in the laboratory? Who didn't hit the villain? Technically, the film was also horrible. The dialogue was more often unclear than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deaf music. In addition, so many scenes like mud. The only redeeming feature was the shootings of Rome and what looked like the Vatican - a performance, for I am sure the Vatican officials would not have liked this shot in and around St Peters - and the interior was convincing. Rome is a magical place and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.
