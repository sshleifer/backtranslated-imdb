I am not surprised to find user comments on this movie full of gushy nonsense, as this film "shows that when it is predetermined, love will find a way." I start this way, so as not to criticize a particular reviewer, but because this reference characterizes the hyperbolic, uncritical trill that was poured over this movie, even before the hit theaters. Even the best of movies "doesn't" prove anything, nor is it intended. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember the study's promotion of "The English Patient" very clearly: "From the producers of 'Amadeus' and" One flew over the nest of the cuckoo ", it announced grandly. An ignorant or careless listener may miss The decisive word "producers" in this monstrous statement and mistakenly associates the director of "The English Patient" with the really great director, Milos Forman, is such a comparison, such a comparison being offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman. <br /> While the novel by Michael Ondaatje, on which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film could not capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. a little similar to the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite worries that began when I heard the shameless misleading promotion, I went to watch this movie in the theater, when it began to unfold, I realized that the rendition of rome The strange magic of his had failed, that the actors knew their words, but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull and unworked. The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely still-born film object of the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who topple over this movie are very likely to talk to adjectives like "sweep" and "grand" and "hypnotic". Well, none of them. In fact, even Ondaatje's fine novel cannot be described as "sweeping" or "grand". It can be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" - but it is precisely the qualities that the film so completely failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella as a reader had completely missed what was valuable in the novel, and could exclude celluloid only a pale skeleton version, a version that not only missed the spirit of history but focused on wrong characters. He produced a cinematic transliteration that not only had any respect for the metaphors of history, but also an obvious knowledge of them. <br /> <br /> Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton who misses the novel's narrative track as well as the "essence" of it. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas embarked on relentless, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional beliefs that were apparently intended to convey a great, running, passionate love affair to the viewer, but actually only providing an inexplicable , perfectionist connection between two flat, superficial, uninteresting fakes. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance gave the viewer with the great emotional response evidently intended by Minghella's large and overwhelming presentation. "The great, sweeping, David-Lean-like" qualities that the many discriminating reviewers of this goofy movie love to refer to are simply not there. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") is positively offensive to another great director. Take, for example, the "Patient's" sandstorm, which is no doubt where these "big" sweeping qualities are believed to have lived (or should have lived): Sandstorm is not great - it is not even convincing. The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and their emergence after the storm, which undoubtedly had to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, was completely lacking in either drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so overtly weak, it had a comedy about where comedy was obvious off. <br /> <br /> This movie failed. It failed as a rendition of the novel, and it failed as a movie. It seems to have been this year's "anointed Oscar vehicle" (in connection with such overtaken cinematic slosh as "Kramer vs Kramer" or "Terms of Endearment"). One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamy had the good sense of presenting the best actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly meritorious performance in the truly outstanding movie "Fargo". There was not a single performance in the executable "English Patient" who was neither embarrassing (Willem Dafoe) nor truly forgettable, mediocre plays (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). Why not the -ity of a movie retains a coven of fanatic (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the time of the sand will permanently limit this mediocrity of a movie, and fortunately it will not have the force ever to dig out.
