I hired the DVD yesterday and first of all it went bad, it's 4: 3 picture format movie and it just gets worse, the play is so bad and the movie itself is a way to predict, I was like watching the movie and saying to myself: this will happen next and guess what happened? Right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action boxing movie, don't see this, you'll end up being disappointed with this low budget movie I did. go and see Ali's way better!
