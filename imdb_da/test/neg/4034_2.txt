No movie I've ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this junk foam. And I've always been a big B movie fan. Having seen this total piece of crap, I can honestly say that this doesn't even come close to being a B movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this movie could act if their lives depended on it. Scripture is so stupid, I don't think I've ever heard anyone speak like this in my life. The author should spend a couple of years studying real people to see how they are acting and talking, even then they would not be able to make a movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent driving them at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. Also, forget about some sexy scenes, the women in the leather garments are so grotesque, you'd rather puke than being turned on! <br /> <br /> Avoid this senseless drive unless you want to get bored of it!
