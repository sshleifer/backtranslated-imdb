First, I must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book. So of course I have some prejudices against any attempt to adapt it to a feature film or television movie. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s, but shot at the Phillips Exeter Academy, where the book's author attended school, and although it was as likely as it could for the book, lacked any real depth of touch and failed to capture the essence of the characters. The original simply seemed to go through the movements. When you read trivia about the movie, you discover that it was thrown mostly with non-actors. Thus, the original has an amateur feel and ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, though I will give it the look of the period better than the original, seems to have thrown the book out all together. Scenes are reorganized, characters imposed where they do not belong, characters created that were not in the book, and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so convincing. And the cardinal sin of all: The tree is not treated as the crucial, almost central character it is in the book. This is an inexplicable overview from the filmmakers' side. How could they break down the role of the tree? Why was it not introduced right away? Why the dead poet-esque beginning? And what in God's name was there with Gens accent? This movie is to be blunt, rubbish. A separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt to the scene or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine, linear style. The filmmakers should have relied on the story as it was already written; make changes, safe; decorate here and there, for sure; Take some mild dramatic licenses. But does one of the beads of the American literature ruin the process? What did they think? In their corruption of the narrative line, they cut any possibility of excitement or drama. The whole movie falls flat and fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a high school or college student who is required to read this book and you are thinking of skimming and just watching the movie ... don't even think about it. This movie doesn't help you. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we have to wait even longer before a version of this story comes to the screen that really does it justice.
