I feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10. Okay, noted that the special effects are "okay" and Renny Harlin made me my favorite genetically modified shark-attack-one-research station movie, which You may know as the Deep Blue Sea. Also, the opening credits are made pretty good with a remix of WhiteZomby's "more human and human", and it goes quite well with what is in the context of this movie. But enough praise, let's get the reason why this movie sucks so much. <br /> <br /> Not since Uwe Bolls Alone in the Dark did I ever feel that the special effects of a movie were completely wasted. Okay, our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families, each having a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that made a never fully explained art of witchcraft. Oh, and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, everyone goes to the same school, everyone is on the swimming pool and everyone, for some reason, is sitting in bed with their shirts, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. I have nothing against gay, gothic, or thirteen-year-olds, but that's what this movie is aimed at ... 13-year-old goth asking their sexuality. Yes, there are girls in the one sitting on their beds in their panties or whatever, but how do they come from their shirts? hi its the only fair. <br /> <br /> In any case, the characters in this movie are told that when they reach 18, they will rise and be given new deep, almost godlike powers. But before I move on, I have forgotten to mention that when they use their power, they age slowly and they become more dependent on it. It explains why they made people in their late 20s play 17-year-olds. Oh, and if something needs to be explained, then calm, someone will explain it all in a big dialogue. God, this movie sucks ... where was I? Oh yes, the ascent section. Okay, apparently there was a super-secret alpha-one family that the others forgot or some like it, I don't know I was killing at this time. But they were written out, how and the new child in school, friends of the group, is 'secretly' one of those descendants of the fifth family. And I'm saying 'secretly' because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. He has greater power than the others because he is older I think. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (says it loudly) things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie. To be honest I was all games for a witch fight. You know as Saurmon vs Gandalf or something like magic battle because you know it's about witches and things. Now, when these two witches throw it down, it's more of the same ... how can I say it ... a very, very crappy version of a Dragonball Z-type match. They throw things into each other, talk, throw things, talk, throw things, talk, etc. When I say 'throw things', I only say that because I have no idea what F #% k throws at each other. It looks like big gobs of slimy water. God, this movie sucks, anyway, when our main witch rises, he doesn't get very strong at all. He just throws larger gobs of slimy water. Things happen, and it ends up in a way that you as the viewer knows it will end. The good witch wins a bad witch loser. <br /> <br /> You know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as, "I'll make you my Wiotch" That's where I would turn my face to sit through the whole This ... thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that the idea of ​​witches is struggling, using powers in the present sounds rather cool, but when the execution is bad, I really wished they didn't make this movie . Maybe if it was R-rated, often had several deaths with a touch of gore, it could have worked ... maybe worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing this, do not buy it or even rent it. Wait for it to come on TV or borrow it from your sucker by a friend who bought it. Don't waste your time with this hack of a movie. If you spend money on it, there is a good chance that you will make an effort against a successor to be made by Uwe Boll, called the Covenant 2: Alone in the dark with the house of the dead.
