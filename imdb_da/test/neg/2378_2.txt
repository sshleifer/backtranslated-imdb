I think it's the first time I go into a theater and go so disappointed. There were two reasons why I went to see "Astérix et les Vikings": first as a movie film and another as a great Astérix fan. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film does not meet any request. It is simply a big animated mess, and it shows that the Astérix franchise goes from bad to worse. In fact, it has been this way since the first scenarios of René Goscinny's death in 1977. His faithful collaborator illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following books clearly lacked the quality that was present during the Goscinny years. "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands", which was published during Goscinny's reign. The basic story is the same: Goudurix, Abraracourcix's nephew arrives at the village, and Astérix et Obélix must make him a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to discover what fear is, for fear seems to give wings . <br /> <br /> The similarities end here. What follows in the book is an uninterrupted series of laughs, gags and fun dialogue, whereby the Vikings discover fear and they flee from Gaul. The movie is stupid, unfunny, fast-paced, corny ... Just mention a standard and it has good chances to be used ... The difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good. But the new ideas just collide in a bottomless pit. Even older Astérix films such as "Astérix le Gaulois", which almost passed the lines one by one without changing them, are easily improved. <br /> <br /> Animation has the quality of other 21st century movies, but it has its flaws and any movie beginner could find the mistakes. The biggest example is the continuity error, where the day follows the night after a fraction of seconds in the same order. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They took animation studies from many countries and they still can't get enough film production. <br /> <br /> The changes in the original story are simply unbearable. And they could still be, even though there was no original story. Goudurix, in the movie, has an animal day by name SMS and acts as his mobile phone (!). Grossbaf, the Viking chief, has a rebellious teenager named Abba (!), And she is constantly tolerating her father's authority. There is also a stupid Viking magician, his cartoon-like stupid and muscular son, the faithful bride of Grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can't stand that much longer. <br /> We are far from the original gags of the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags that don't have the same appeal on a theater screen. I remember that the greatest moments in the book were Obélix, who laughed at the intruders' names (all of which are finished in 'off') and Goudurix is ​​trying to scare them in ridiculous ways. <br /> <br /> And if not enough, someone in the advertising staff has decided to write on the movie poster that there is already a Céline Dion song that will be included in the final credits. If it was a new song, I could have understood it. But using an old song is just another proof that the movie is so badly made that they are ready to do everything to attract movie actors. The only good point for this movie is that it's so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't go out of the theater without getting cold. In a summer release, it just can't hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point in the movie is how Goudurix becomes brave. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it is better depicted in the film, and the motivation is more credible. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money on it. Take the book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh René, why did you leave us?
