To sum it all up, skip End of Day and see renting Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate instead. This movie is the perfect stereotypical American movie vs. Ninth Gate as the perfect stereotypical European movie. Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, nicely scored, atmospheric, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good filmography, fun one-liners, intellectual, minimal foul language, thought-provoking. The only mistake is that a few people did not understand the open end and said the movie was "crappy" because of it, and there were a couple of dubious scenes. End of Days: Too violent, liberal use of spooky language, no musical score except for a bad attempt at a commercial soundtrack only heard when Gabriel Byrne stalked around NYC as Satan (but all you could choose was Korn's Jonathan Davis incomprehensibly screaming), sex that had nothing to do with the plot, the violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention much more violence? I think some of the special effects were good, but it's about it. Maybe I was wrong, but I thought the ninth port was much more interesting, quirky, original and intelligent. But maybe the Americans don't need it. * Drinking with cynicism * Although I'm American, I sometimes wonder.
