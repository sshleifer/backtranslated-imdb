This movie was totally rubbish. I sat and watched this completely furious that this was funded. They absolutely spent their budget on the special FX instead of the screenwriter and director and some of the actors. <br /> <br /> First, the actor was bland and rubbish. The story was not related to the audience enough. Instead of being from people's perspective of the storm, the story was told more from government figures and the army, which really is not a way of connecting them, as most of us hate politicians at least. The author tried to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the tiny part plot about the father and son who failed altogether. <br /> <br /> As for the steering ... oh god, his techniques of trying and creating excitement and turmoil are repetitive and over the top. It sped up camera movements and then suddenly flash bolt pause on a character's face when something terribly happened, was pathetic. The only reason I saw it to the end was to see the special FX. It's a bad thing, since special FX shouldn't make the movie, it should only enhance the story and the experience. There was no history. <br /> <br /> I really wouldn't bother to see this, the overall waste and the embarrassment of the British film industry.
