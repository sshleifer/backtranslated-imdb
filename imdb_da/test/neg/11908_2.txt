The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director also did it for a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is time and place for "emotion" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart who recited Shakespeare was very good but still inappropriate. Wouldn't recommend or see again. The close-ups and padded text and partial plots were lost to me. Adding foreign material and scenes takes away from a really good job. The scriptwriter was supposed to find another profession where he could reject his talent, perhaps the afternoon soap would be a better place. Check out the really good version and pass it on.
