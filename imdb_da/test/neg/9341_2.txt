I grew up in the 90s; Therefore, you must understand that I witness first-hand premiere of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc. These films are my childhood. When these movies came on, not only myself but who I saw them would be in awe of 1:30, talk about it for the coming week and catch it again next weekend. I don't think words could express the amount of excitement that Zoog Disney brought. <br /> <br /> Even when I see them now, the dialogue doesn't seem so bad (so effective in fact, I actually remember parts of conversations literally words per word, from movies I saw over ten years ago). The characters are trustworthy, funny, given a little stereotypical, but that's what makes Disney's charm ... I sat down my little brother in front of the Disney channel to try to convey and make him understand my feelings for DCOMs. Entered in the suburbs ... my brother looked a little confused and asked me if I had always been gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now than what could I compare to this? When Han Solo found out that Lando was selling him to Vader ... Half of the movie, and I'm not exaggerating, are flashbacks. There is no talent in these young players (some of which are older than I am) at all. The reason is ridiculous; It feels like a bunch of old decaying businesses over at Disney sat around a table and asked themselves, "How can we seem hip to these young people?" OK, maybe all the DCOMs were like that, but at least they did a little effort not to let us realize they think we are complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently, this type of movie works ... Stack in the suburbs is rated almost as much as Zenon or Airborne. How is it possible? The DCOMs were even cheesier and people prefer them now? (Although apparently lacking curse words is enough to give it 10/10 for some people) Christ, it is a completely different generation.
