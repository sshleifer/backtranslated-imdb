The series finally hit the rock bottom with this miserable fourth installment, which was (thank goodness) the last. None of the three successors made the right to the very entertaining original, but this particular movie is nothing but a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the "Magnificent Seven" and Bernstein's arousing music theme. The production values ​​are similar to those made for TV movies, and the characters are forgettable and discernible: in parts "II" and "III" you can't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for Chris's role, but no one could have replaced Yul Brynner in our mind anyway. Do not waste your time.
