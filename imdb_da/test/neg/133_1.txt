These days writers, directors and manufacturers rely more and more on the "surprise" ending. The old art of bringing a movie to a close, taking all the information we've learned through the movie and bringing it to a nice complete end, has been lost. Now what we have is a movie that, no matter how complicated, detailed or lukewarm, can be packed in 5 minutes. It was all in his / her head. This explanation is the director's safety net. If everything else fails, or if the writing was not so good or if we ran out of money to complete the movie, we can always say "it was all in his / her head" and finish the movie that way. The audience wants to buy it, for well, none of us are psychologists, and neither of us suffers from schizophrenia (not what we know), so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a strong thing. Some movies have pulled it off. But these films are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings. Every director / writer now thinks they can pull it off because Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity and this movie (just to name a few).
