I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as "Big Brain on" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But I just didn't care about the signs at all. Kevin Spacey is a dot throughout the movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him I didn't like him. Especially the end --- that made me hate him even more. It was like seeing a bad car wreck. Spacey played a dot well (he does it all well), but apart from that, I don't recommend it.
