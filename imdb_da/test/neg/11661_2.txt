The hindi remake of Mrs. Doubtfire starring and directed by Kamal Hassan is a somewhat creepy version and not as good as expected. Kamal Hassan is clearly struggling with Hindi Dialogues, even after all these years, and cannot handle even a scene effortlessly. The guy is aged and should give it a break. Hassan brings nothing new to the role or character that Dustin Hoffman does to Tootsie or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli makes to Mavshi's (moster's) character in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Moru's Aunt, comedy). /> <br /> What was the child playing with firecrackers as it was not Diwali? Most of Chachi's romantic "cross-connections" - Vs Amrish, Paresh, and then Johny Walker, seem redundant for the main story. Tabu sauna was unnecessary. The family is North Indian but must be reminded of Karva Chauth's evening of a 'Maharashtrian' Chachi. Yes right. <br /> <br /> The fine acting values ​​of not one, but four actors for Tabu, About Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal have been wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> See the original Mrs. Doubtfire - pure, crisp and crackling with fun, unlike Chachi 420.
