The most hardcore bad movie buffer will be surprised by the overall uncertainty of this grade-z "movie". Mary Woronov, a smart actress best known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar in Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best thing about this trip. This movie is almost too bad even for MST3K - honestly!
