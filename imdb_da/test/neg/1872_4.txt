Just caught "The Rain People" at Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars like Natalie, a housewife from Long Island, who - for unknown reasons - leaves her husband and goes on a road trip, without knowing exactly where to go. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player "Jimmy" (James Caan) who has been kicked out of his college and hitchhiking. There are many twists along the way between these two as Natalie struggles to look after Jimmy and she begins to realize that he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. She goes through her own struggles, it is unnecessary to say and not able to take care of him. Natalie seems to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; She makes some odd phone calls to her husband asking her to come home. Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times, only to get him into his life through the circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled policeman who turns to Natalie. You make sense all the time that this movie is going to end finally and it does. This film is sometimes uneven at times, and the manuscript is missing something. Francis Ford Coppola briefed this, and of course he would soon become very famous in the coming years to rule "The Godfather." The actors are good, it is unnecessary to say, since they would all have futures in front of them in movies. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also undervalued as an actor. James Caan is particularly effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character. This movie remains a little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is an early film by Coppolas, and I admit that I had never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies to bring it to a new audience.
