I don't care if this show manages to convey deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The show is shit .... how can anyone enjoy seeing it? But it was received so well. This reflects a sad state of affairs for Joe Moron out there. <br /> <br /> I was trying to see this program as it first came out as friends talked about it. The inner laughter between the two main characters and the pitiful dialogue made me want to cry. It is convinced that people can see this show. Still, I suppose the creators had the last laugh .... making themselves wealthy by taking p.ss out of the very people who would see a show like this. <br /> <br /> I'd bet, they are laughing at the bank.
