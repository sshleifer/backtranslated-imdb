When I first saw the trailer to The Comebacks, it looked awful, and I had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on DVD today, I figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest I would rent it and give it a shot. I saw it tonally and it really wasn't that bad. I think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were some fun moments that made me laugh. I don't see a lot of sports movies, so maybe I wonder if I saw more, maybe this movie would be more sensible to me, but that's all good, I don't mind so much to see Comebacks. I admit that these "stupid spoof" movies are lame, but what is the damage in a stupid joke every now and then? Comebacks are not that bad if you give it a fair chance. Coach Fields fails in life, family and career both, but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser soccer team into the championship. But the team is really really terrible, just like beyond terrible. But with a little work and team effort, they try to give it their all, even though it can turn into something more sad. <br /> <br /> Comebacks over all is not the worst movie I've seen, I think it's good for a few laughs and giggles. I know it was stupid, but I couldn't help laughing when the coach came in the middle of a fight in the closet, and he hit the nerd's head against the lock, just he and the nerd were generally so funny together. If you have an open mind and do not take this movie seriously, I think you will have fun watching it, if you expect it to be an Oscar worthy material, it is not the movie for you. <Br /> <br /> 4/10
