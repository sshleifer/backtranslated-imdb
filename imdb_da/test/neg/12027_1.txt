I bought this movie invisible at a sci-fi conference, and I got what I deserved to do something silly. It is simply said that this movie is impossible, boring and invisible. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted by the lack of plot development that I knocked it off to see a repeat of Mythbusters. I understand this was a very low budget movement, or at least it looked like a very low budget movement, but it did not apologize for the horrible acting, terrible plot and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and became full. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the villain wasn't so ridiculous and the plot was something that could actually happen in reality with respect to law enforcement it could be so bad it's fun. This movie is not fun, it's just bad.
