If you're looking for a precise portrayal of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped to help Fidel Castro with his bid for power would better read about the Cuban story or even write in his name on a search engine (you're on The Internet). <br /> <br /> Whatever you do, don't see "CHE!" <br /> <br /> Of course, unless you just want a good laugh. <br /> <br /> All reviewers of the time (and movie group) gave "Che!" their voice for the worst movie of the decade. And no wonder; Have you seen this travesty? Its facts are at best scared, Sharif is even unconvincing as a corpse and for Palance's Fidel Catsro imitation .... As I said, if you want a good laugh. <br /> <br /> It's like watching a co-production between The Learning Channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> A star. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Palance can make W.C. Fields too?
