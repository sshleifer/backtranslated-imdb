For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. Not only is it a comedy that fails to be even extremely fun, but there is nothing to laugh at * about * the movie. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money. I have never seen a movie that annoyed me so much. It's a movie about stupid people who do stupid and horrible things. I also don't really know how a person with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. I have been using IMDb for some time but felt obliged to sign up to prevent poor unsuspecting people from renting or, worse, buying this stink !! Real waste of time and money. I have to say that the line is horrible.
