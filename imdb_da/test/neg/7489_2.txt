I watched this movie on TV last night and hoped for a realistic account of what could happen if there was an outbreak of a highly transmissible disease. I was disappointed and I think the movie was garbage. It didn't work right for me. Some of the actors were horrible, especially the doctors. She was about the worst I have seen. It all played like a CNN 'worst case scenario'. Even the mandatory disaster films human relations bits did not seem sincere. I've seen some disaster movies, especially the weather, which is actually so bad they are entertaining. This is almost as bad, but it's not even fun, it's boring and boring. Don't break with this one.
