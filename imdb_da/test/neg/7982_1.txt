Suppressing black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) flying her house on Christmas Eve when she discovers her husband (Tony Goldwyn), has hired a hitman to kill her. She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then it goes wrong. Farrow basically keeps going and continuously meets VERY strange people and comes in morbid unfunny situations. <br /> <br /> This was announced as a good movie when I watched it around Christmas time on the very short run of an art cinema. I found it sick, unfunny and just depressing. I like black humor, but it was too dark for me. What happened to Parker's character was especially scary. To make matters worse, Eileen Brennan is thrown in like a nun (!!!) later and continues to chew nature with gusto. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was Farrow's acting - it's much better than this picture deserves. It was also a relief to see the very talented Stephen Dorff appear at the end. The end itself was cute, but it couldn't delete what had gone before. <br /> <br /> Sick, morbid, pitch black "comedy".
