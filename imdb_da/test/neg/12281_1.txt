I had to write a review for this movie based on those who say gory, non stop action, great movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people were watching another movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go !! I waited and waited for this movie to get better and it was of no use. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory, but I can't find any of these adjectives actually showing up in this, I mean hell there are so many scenes with people being shot and there is no blood at all is it not even fun! ! I think the best way to summarize it is to have been rated PG by 1984 standards and now in 2010 there is no doubt that this would be PG !! Bad, BAD NOT in the fun cheesy "B" black movie !!
