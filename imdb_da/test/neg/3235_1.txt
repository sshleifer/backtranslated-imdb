I still find it hard to believe that a fine - whose over-length novel by Dean Koontz was transformed into this complete excuse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad it is disgusting. Boos to everyone who participated. Shame on you! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that successors have emerged just goes to show how little taste and discretion is in Silver Screen Land.
