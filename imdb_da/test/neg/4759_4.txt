A ridiculous comedy given a gunshot direction. I love one of the comments here: "Couldn't be done today". Well, it could not "The Philadelphia Story" without a car or two. Nevertheless, does it mean that the image is worse for wear to be old-fashioned? I don't think "Susan slept here" was good for any generation and it should be peaceful in the memories of Debbie Reynolds buffs. There is no spark in this story of a screenwriter locked on a much younger girl for "script research". Dick Powell makes his color screen look in what may have been an embarrassment to him. Reynolds is pallid. Produced by a Harriet Parsons - giving her famous mother Louella a variety of inward connectors. * 1/2 from ****
