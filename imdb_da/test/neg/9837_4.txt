This is one of the classic B-movies after the exploitation of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid runs off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in like creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the father's voice goes up 10 octaves ("You loved her?"). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupid, but not as embarrassing as our star. There is also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at dinner. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. And the yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and liquor is hurt according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hoot. See the MST cover on this and Crow's amazing Elam greeting!
