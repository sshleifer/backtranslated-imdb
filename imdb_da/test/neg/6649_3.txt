After breaking into a secret database file for matching DNA serum, Federal Agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) discovers the only person who can save his son's life, a psychopath played by Michael Keaton. But when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes horribly wrong, a particular Mr.Poo must do everything to ensure that the madman becomes alive to make the inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I just want to call it him. Despite the original concept that is present, this is a creepy and eerie action thriller. I have never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and given his charecter here is not the attachment, this movie is getting worse. The action sequences are handled rather disappointingly, and the end sucks pretty badly. Having done a great villain in Pacific Heights, Keaton's psychopathic bad guy is a disappointment that gives a madman a fun and charismatic to be sorry. Brian Cox is also wasted as Garcia's firm and honest superior.
