Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production does NOT make his wonderful tongue in the cheek novel any justice. Starting at the top ... poorly adapted. Screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to - think about it, I don't know what she was trying for, but it's enough to say she missed the mark of light years !! Pair it with all the overpowering and terrible production values, it is an adaptation that should never happen. It would have been much better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this outrageous production!
