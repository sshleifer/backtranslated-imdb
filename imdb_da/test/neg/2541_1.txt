First, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It can make you see it, but it's not bad in a good way. It is boring, unreliable, badly shot, ridiculous script and lacking in cool disaster effects. It's worse, it is intensely patriotic with no trace of irony or fun, turning in a sense of Japanese uniqueness and sacrifice. Everyone surrenders the Japanese in their time of need. The Koreans in particular. The most noble characters choose seppaku - go down with their ship as their beloved beer sinks. "Only Japanese would think this way," said the Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If this movie in any way reflects the Japanese perception of their place in the world view, the first thing they have to do to fix the problem is to stop making movies like this.
