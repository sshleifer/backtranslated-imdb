I am ashamed to publicly admit that I myself had covered this movie sometime! This is an absolute reason why you should investigate the movie before you see it! The filmmakers in this movie have called us all fools and credible losers with too much time on our hands. Based on the mythical Indian shifting powerful cobra and rebirth, history takes us to a painful trip. College goes 40+ actors (now really?) Is the goal of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was in his former life a cobra but is now a ghost!) And her pathetic, eternal, powerful girlfriend cobra / killer machine girlfriend Munish Kohli (fortunately not seen since). Now you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I'm voting to study for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie! Give it a passport if you are healthy. If not ... then you will probably enjoy it.
