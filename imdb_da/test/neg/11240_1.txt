I just gave a 10 to Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons that one can prove that I'm not a git that only gives bad reviews but 2 because the movie theme has the same thread for falling in love with a woman by night. <br /> <br /> We all know beautiful woman is a chick flick, but you can't avoid them all, they eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two horrible horrible horrible things, firstly depicting prostitution as a career more akin to the dancer, you know with amazing friends, the leg warms lots of giggles, lends each other's makeup. In fact, you see Pretty Woman, the prostitute, and this is a street walker Prostitute we are talking about here, have a good life, she is healthy happy with only occasional whining to explain her problems. My feeling is that this "happy hooker" type protagonist is much more tasty than an almost realistic character, which to me asks whether you are making a movie about a person, but is too scared to adorn that person plays with characteristics known for the role, why do it? If I make a movie about a cook but do not want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat, then why make a movie about a cook in the first place? By bending out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type, the story fails altogether and thus never indulges in any of the moral or social issues that it might have, what a policeman really paralyzed. <br /> <br /> Secondly, "Pretty Woman" offends the romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no idea to seduce or romance this "lady" who is without her plastic friend, you do not go home without It, especially if you are a moron in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve the spread of cash somehow, even when he first meets her is the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds that limos over there, money money money where is the charm? where is the charisma, don't mention the attempt on the piano please. <br /> <br /> Girls who like this movie will also be girls who like to shop more than most. Guys, who like this movie, have not even realized that the old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they also do not have it or not. More importantly, anyone who likes this movie hates 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story about which part is based on the same subject. <br /> <br /> I end a song: <br /> <br /> Pretty Woman Hangin Around The Street Pretty Woman, The Kind I Like To Treat Pretty Woman, I Don't Believe You You're Not The Truth No one can spend as much as you Mercy Pretty Woman, you will not apologize Nice woman, I could not help but see Pretty Woman, and you look nice as it may be, you lack imagination like me. Pretty Woman, shop a piece of Pretty Woman, talk a Mens Pretty Woman, sell your smile to me Pretty Woman, yeah yeah, yeah Pretty Woman, see my way Pretty Woman, you want to stay with me .. and I pay you .. I treat you right
