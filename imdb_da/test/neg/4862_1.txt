Fun. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang have all had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as callow naif in Wall Street or Sutherland as the cynical Korean war surgeon in MASH? Both Waterston and Lang have both had successful television and film careers (law and order, killing fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc.). So what in the world would any of these fine actors do in a stink bomb like this? <br /> <br /> Shadow Conspiracy's plot of a Washington coup d'etat isn't really that bad, unoriginal maybe, but not so bad. Sure it's done (seven days in May - a nice movie!) But with a little tweaking it could still have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> Shadow Conspiracy is the main problem in performance. Early in the film Sheen, politically strategically extreme, it ridiculously and unintentionally solves a potential PR gaff by blackmailing a congressman. Later, gunplay with Lang's dumb hitman tears half of what was supposed to be Georgetown, explained to the news as "gangster". Has anyone remotely connected to this movie ever lived a day in Washington? Sheen is about 20 years old, too young, to be so senior in a White House Administration. Sheen's answer to averting a political crisis is then loaded with false machismo, he looks as if he was attending David Hasselhoff's play school. And when was the last time gang fights spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a part of Washington where citizens voted against having a metro stop so they could maintain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would have been unbearable without the fast-paced button. I taped it from HBO a year ago and then took 3 separate pictures to plow through. <br /> <br /> In summary: Don't buy this movie. Don't even rent this movie. If you see it at Blockbuster, run as soon as possible.
