This opens with the company's credits that inform us about it by the World International Network. I knew I had seen this business credit before but couldn't remember where, but knew it was at the beginning of a really bad movie I had seen so I seriously thought about changing channels, only thing I saw each movie on the other channels, which is one of the problems with being an IMDB reviewer. What the hell did I not really believe if WANTED is good or bad because I still can review it for this site. As I expected, WANTED was not so good. It's a plot I've seen so many times (too many times) before I involve a refugee on the run, a bit like THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV series without the t-shirt rope. Jimmy crosses the mob in a completely constructed way and starts, and finds himself in a completely constructed way at a Catholic Reform School. Have you noticed an often used description in the last sentence? "Fully constructed" is the answer. Let me repeat for it hard to believe that this is a completely constructed film where everything depends on randomness. Another problem I had had was the Reform School run by the church - it's too compassionate and friendly, I have believed that this type of business makes Alcatraz look like a country club, I say this is a fact but when the main priest looks like the spitting image of Donald Rumsfeld you feel there is a large amount of sugar coating going on. To be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists etc. WANTED is not really a bad thriller even though it is a terribly good one either. I never really wanted to extinguish it, no matter how it happened, it was a compliment to the movie
