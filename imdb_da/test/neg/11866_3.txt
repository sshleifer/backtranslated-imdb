Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. And of course they do their best to change it a little, but miraculously fail. Snipes delivers its gentle performance as he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to steal in a movie, but just sex appeal. The worst part is that it did not cover my bad movie basics, which are: 1 ?? Cheap great villains. 2 ?? Perfectly timed one-liners. 3 ?? Intense car gates with massive explosions. 4 ?? The hero is linked to the hot chicken. 5 ?? Lots of naked or gently dressed women for no reason. OK so I lied, covering them, but making it so terrible.
