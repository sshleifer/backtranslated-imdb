Does this not seem familiar? Oh wait, that's right. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the TV series. What is the point of repeating yourself, can you ask? Is it beneficial for Americans who haven't seen the program? Did the manuscripts write out inspiration? Or maybe everyone had seen a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot that they had already covered this ground? Either way, for anyone who has put through the first three series, it was just really boring. I had to turn it off under the "tablets that make your water green" part .. yes it is very fun, but give us something original for the sake of goodness! In fact, if the best new stuff you can come up with is Leonard Rossiter's Saturday Night Fever, you can forget about it. <br /> <br /> The guy they got to replace late Richard Beckinsale is a lookalike okay, but not half the actor. Personally, I would exercise the role of a sign of respect for him. Or better yet, not bothered to make the movie at all, and just leave the hilarity of doubt speak for itself. But no, they couldn't do it ... not as long as there was money to be made. Sad, really. 4.10
