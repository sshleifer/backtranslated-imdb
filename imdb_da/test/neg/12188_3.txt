Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less of a movie that does it and shows a certain lack of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the movie seems like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and cute, although it was a bit uncomfortable in the presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music and even a whole lot of the scene that was blocking the previous version. I do not understand the point of making the film again, as the method to recreate it was to basically make George Cukor's movie with everything but the people working on it.
