Yes, this movie of course tries to be Conan the Barbarian, and what astonishes me is that this is a sequel (the people demanded another?). The first part of the girl is a flashback showing the original. From what I saw it doesn't seem to be checking out (and apparently Ator always kills a huge puppet in her movies). Now Ator lives at the ends of the earth with his stupid sidekick Thong. A girl is seeking her help as this evil guy has his father in his custody. Let me just say that this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just speaks endlessly. The bad guy is waiting at the end of the movie and finally knocking the old guy around and leaving you wondering "What took him so long to catch?" Meanwhile, Ator and his sidekick and mad go through an adventure after another. They struggle with hollow men, invisible soldiers (don't ask), rent a slut and people who worship snakes. Ator also fights a huge snake doll and hanging glides (again, don't ask). Yet you want to think that Conan would kick Ator's ass.
