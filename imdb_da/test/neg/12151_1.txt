First of all, I am not thinking whether to use my imagination in this movie or the director tried to save money or low budget! Here we go .... Basically there were so many years and holes that I don't understand, it was as if the movie jumped from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so many holes that make you ask how the hell did this ? and why? I think it's a big stream. Forget about the reviews that stop history, this movie not only has historical facts problems, but also has so many mistakes. So most people continue to say this in the cinema, you will lose all the movie pictures like rivers, deserts etc. It is true they are beautiful, therefore I have been waiting for BluRay release 1080p. OKAY! beautiful scenes but what is the meaning of it? I turned off the movie after 1 hour and half, I just lost interest. The movie continued to do the exact same thing that jumped this year (at least Mr. Director put for example after 2 years after 10 years!) I think I couldn't see the movie, I lost understanding of what was happening! Anyways I wish I could include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how did this happen? you want to know what i mean! Don't look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
