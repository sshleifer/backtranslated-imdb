Oh my God, this is so idiotic. Totally pointless, offensive and repulsive. Why have the authors such a problem getting Zoey and Chase together, we all want them too! In normal shows, there is actually more than one plot conflict in the show, wow what a concept. Also, you can't even tell Zoey 101 episodes apart, because the same thing happens every time. Quinn exploits Dustin for some weird stuff, Nicole is gigantic and stupid, Zoey's just kind of there, Chase slobbers after her all the time, but she's not surprisingly wondering, and Logan is a dunk. repeat. Quinn exploits Dustin for some weird stuff, Nicole is gigantic and stupid, Zoey's just kind of there, Chase slobbers after her all the time, but she's not surprisingly wondering, and Logan is a dunk. repeat. It's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, again. so meaningless nothing happened. It is as if they have specifically designed it so that the film could fit between two episodes of the show, and the show would go completely unchanged after the movie plot.
