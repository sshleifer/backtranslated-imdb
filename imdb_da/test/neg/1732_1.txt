It was fun because it was all so unrealistic, I mean, move on, as a pop star would just show up at a primary school and fall in love with the girl being obsessed with him? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone with the maid was terribly horrible at acting. The dialogue was cheesy, the assumption was stupid, and the camera's work was poorly done. I felt I saw a poor home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I have been wasting almost 2 hours in my life, never coming back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say except that I would rather hit my face more than see this movie again.
