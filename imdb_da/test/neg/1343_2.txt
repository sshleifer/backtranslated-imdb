The women (2008) by Diane English are unfortunately a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman, who I like and enjoy in everything I have seen them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes, who may not be my favorite actors, but It's nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and simply bad? It was made by Diane English, known as the author of the highly successful TV show Murphy Brown, and it's her first movie for which she wrote a script. The film has been a love work for English that for many years had tried to make it happen and I respect it. In short, I found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, chic and fun, but generally the movie is a "Sex and the City" that was released a few months ago. I didn't find Sex and the City very good when I saw it, but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's supply room, where one of the characters' had a baby and her friends were there who supported her. Bad Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve the nightmare she was doing, and we, the viewers along with her? The films like "The Women" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It's not something wrong with the genre, but why is it so hard to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, to deal with marriage, motherhood, and prove yourself professionally? It is all very convincing and important issues that a modern woman can relate to. Why make movies with lines, dialogues and situations so clich√©dic, predictable, not funny and insulting that they are forgotten as soon as the movie is over? After I watched the new movie, I checked out the original women from my local library and I really enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest all the way. The old film had a real star force.
