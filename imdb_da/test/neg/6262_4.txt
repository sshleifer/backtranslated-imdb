I have never expected too much from a movie by the sly-named BD director Jim Wynorski: a stupid premise, some cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes, and I'm usually pretty happy. <br /> <br /> Well, the Cheerleader Massacre delivers on the past and the latter, but unfortunately it is a bit light when it comes to the splatter. And when a movie has the word "massacre" in the title and scrimps on gore, then Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's film is centered on a group of cheerleaders who, along with their teacher, minibus driver and a few guys, are stranded in the mountains during a blizzard. They walk on foot to a deserted mountain retreat where they find food and shelter. And a crazy murderer who wants them all dead! From the beginning, good old Jim ensures that his movie contains lots of scenes filled with T&A, and includes the mandatory shower scene along with many other moments where tasty women get necklaces (including a spot of raunchy softcore sex and a very free three-babe-in-a-hot-tub scene). None of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders (and are never even seen in their outfits), but who cares about such details when they are too willing to get away in the name of art? <br /> <br /> But I don't care about the film's many missing deaths. With such an extremely lurid title, I had hoped for some inventive bloodletting to go with all the pimples, shrubs and breasts; Instead, almost all the killings without a screen or function occur next to no one do. Only a silly after-creation scene (obtained with cheap-as-chips CGI) comes anywhere near delivering the goods. <br /> <br /> Still, if you feel in the mood for some titillation or a bit of slasher silliness minus horror, then in 82 minutes, at least Cheerleader Massacre won't be too much of a waste of your time.
