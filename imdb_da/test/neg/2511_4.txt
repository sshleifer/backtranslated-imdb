Alien body-snatchers in the desert. Small blue rocks that look like they are made of cheap plastic. The overall story is not bad if you like that kind of thing, but the play is so far beyond the poor that it surprises me that some of them actually entertained me in The X Files! And the special effects? Hi?! Where did they get their FX crew from high school? I mean, come on now; there was so much more they could have done! It was amateur and very basic. I didn't really enjoy it (and my father fell asleep under it!) And of course our hero falls in love with the leading lady! It is so typical and very predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
