As you may not know EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of Portugal's most righteously famous writers. He was witty, he spared no one in his critics and is now going to roll in his grave. And this is not because this film is bad as it is, but as a result of the treatment given to one of his masterworks "O Crime do Padre Amaro". It was treated as cheap, flexible waste. When it was published that this should be a "modern and urban" take the book I feared for the worst, it usually means modern in these contexts that one takes the liberty to take **** when making an adaptation, to half-rob it in the shoddiest possible way. And then a priest's moral and social dilemma with a secretly forbidden affair is replaced by extra-long passages of people who treat drugs and sing hip-hop for no particular or relevant reason for the plot. It's just there as it may not have been. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's lots of sex so you can at least count on it when you put it on. Remember how each movie in the 80s, regardless of the genre or tone, has always found a way to sneak into some nudity? If it was a thriller and they didn't need it, they simply found a way that when they caught a crime, "he" happened to be in bed with a woman who would boast about screaming (naked of course) when the police broke in. Ahem, free is the word I think. Not that there is anything wrong with naked scenes, but here the creators of this movie look desperate, simply because there is nothing else in the movie, it is completely devoid of what you call the dramatic content.
