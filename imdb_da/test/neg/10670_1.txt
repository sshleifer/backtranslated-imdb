First thing first, how can a person with his creativity on the right believe in a movie like this. I watched this movie, and after a few hours left scratches my head, what exactly directs the instructor to say. <br /> <br /> If there is a thriller, there is no excitement if its action there is no action that excludes a chase sequence, there is no drama, and the very prominent love story never actually takes it off. No passion, emotion, there is nothing there. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never expected wonders from the movie, but after the opening of the bumper, I thought about giving it a try. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya at all, and I'm not one of those guys who will bash him at any given opportunity. I went in with an open mind and came out with a closed. <br /> <br /> Let's not blame Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a debut actor. But direction, manuscript, writing, makeup, everything has gone to a caste. Himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to get to the basket. He can do such roles. Hansika is just a child and it appears on the screen with her baby fat and the way she goes. <br /> <br /> The only actor who was good was Himesh's friend in the movie, I don't know his name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk, not even good at seeing it for a time trial. <br /> <br /> ** Highly recommended to avoid this movie. **
