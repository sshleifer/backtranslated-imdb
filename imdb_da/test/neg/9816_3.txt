A pig-tailed Linnea Quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex. She goes to an asylum, makes a best friend out of Amy (Karen Russell), and the two extortion goes out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "Carol Burnett Show" regularly by Lyle Wagoner). On the outside, these two hitting mafia stop princesses (!) Taking their medicine and inviting six slimball ex-boyfriends to their big country home for a party, systematically slaughtering on very gory ways of a skin, leather-clad mystery killer. The gentle David Barton FX is so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a kind of surrealistic quality. The same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so weird and silent, the movie is so immensely fast-paced and edited, and the actor is so world-wide you start to doubt your own beauty. This movie actually tries to get a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it's all so badly handled, it's almost like what would happen if Ed Wood made a rewrite of an Ingmar Bergman script! And like any good Bergman movie, this has a mature morale to adhere to - Any good party has a real girl / girl relationship "so there will be enough chickens to" tickle your lizard. "See for yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I myself was interested in seeing this to begin with) is very funny in this, has much more dialogue than usual and has several glances naked scenes. also from the last third of this movie, and the movie suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
