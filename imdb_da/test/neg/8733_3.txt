After his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson played in many different projects, including television shows and smaller films. But I think "Embryo" is his only trip as a mad scientist, and that's probably a good thing. I suppose he needed the work. <br /> <br /> Driving along a dark and stormy night hits brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) an injured Doberman, whom he brings back to his lab (resembling a Tank Midwestern basement). He then manages to raise the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb, so of course he decides to do the same with a human being. He raises Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) from a fetus in the same way. Victoria is growing at an astounding pace and is soon flourishing for a beautiful young woman. Predictably it goes very wrong. After a halcyon start, Holliston's son-in-law Martha (Diane Ladd) begins to wonder where the young woman came from, and Victoria herself shows signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is a long car chase straight out of "Smokey and Bandit", after which Victoria ?? who has shocking age in just a few minutes? Being attacked by a hectic Holliston who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation with the unborn child. All of this is accompanied by screaming tires, roaring engines, car fires and lots of sirens. The secret end? A lot of paramedics work hard at Victoria while Holliston writhes in regret? Is more labor than scary. <br /> <br /> Although made in 1976, this movie is very dated. The only difference between this and the many 1940s crazy research films is that Hudson plays the lead role instead of Boris Karloff. The sets are pretty cheap and very outdated to today's audiences to the extent that Hudson's real-to-real tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson sleeps through his sordid role, giving the impression that he is really a washed movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more credible. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall cards appear as a chess player. Passport The video transfer is very substandard and looks like it was made from a poor VHS copy using home equipment. If you're nostalgic in 1976, keep an eye on this once to say you did it. Otherwise, you should see a football match or soap opera instead.
