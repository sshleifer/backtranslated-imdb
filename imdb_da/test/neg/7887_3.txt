SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (USA: The Hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> Image Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Dolby Stereo SR a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated suicides, an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) uses a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes the victims acted on a post-hypnotic proposal. But their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force in the workplace associated with a young girl (Miho Kanno) whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse ... Based on a novel by Keisuke Matsuoka, this close-plot mystery takes inspiration from various sources (Italian gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some of the images in the climatic show reveal a more immediate influence: Hideo Nakatas RING (1998) recent commercial success. For all its ambition, however, SAIMIN is a routine pot boiler that stumbles poorly after a powerhouse opening (suicides are particularly impressive despite some weak CGI effects), although director Masayuki Ochiai - who wrote the script with Yasushi Fukuda - brings together procedures for an expanded final where the horrible secrets of the story are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of the novel-turned video game PARASITE EVE (1997) - which also starred inagainst Inagaki (member of Japanese pop group SMAP) - and while SAIMIN echoes the film's strong visual sense, it falls short of drama, and most of the characters are just digits, which undermines the emotional payout of the storylin. It's a shame, for the last half hour has been galvanized by a series of dynamic set pieces - especially a concert hall's order, where Dvorak's 'New World' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder! - And Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. But those who are enticed by the promise of gory carnage can be disappointed - the film is long on the atmosphere and short on splatter. <br /> <br /> Performances are varied due to the script's limitations, but Kanno (TOMIE) is excellent as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorders - as the subtitles on the printed notification do not acknowledge us as a viable medical state of Japan! - Who falls in exchange for a sleazy television hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), a primary suspect in the murders. Inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role, and he is constantly raised by Udui, a veteran artist whose career dates back to the "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> (Japanese Dialogue)
