From the fertile imagination that brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), the even more perishable (read goofier) ​​sequel comes: just outside the bat we get yet another impenetrable "start of time" prolo that even strives to completely to contradict the same events as created in the first movie! a condensed assembly of highlights from the same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credit sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven important (but poorly animated) thunderbirds ?? a crime that for one thing puts the moon's care on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you can say "nepotism", sends Zeus (again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sending his master ?? who has rightly taken the place of the elite thanks to the omnipotent tasks performed in the first film? finding its thriving thunderbolts and averting disasters in the store. <br /> <br /> Previously, Hercules (Lou Ferrigno? as if you didn't know) touched the earthly surface that he came in contact with two attractive ladybirds (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) who needed to get them out of need! the former (who would continue to be an Italian television personality) apparently has the ability to talk to the small people (!) ?? who look scary as the little sisters from GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964) !! Just so they can scam so much unused footage from the first movie as it is humanly possible, reviving the divine quartet of crooks good ol 'King Minos (William Berger again) from his skeleton lock and once again putting him against his eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly enemies, including a Gorgon ?? a very underproduced order which should have led to a surefire plagiarism suit, the filmmakers behind the very superior CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) had plagued seeing this flick (complete with the same "reflection in a shield" before the Muslim lets the audience in on its tactics before he performs them as if to show us how clever he is !! And to make it clear that he has his influences on his sleeve, Cozzi Hercules and Minos have turned into a cosmic version of "King Kong vs Godzilla" for one of their battles and later King Kong comes to address a large snake, a meeting lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original. I swear: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As was the case with the first movie, is the casting full of old reliables like the aforementioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (like a wizard with a really bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets? ? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and once again Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily fights her appearance in the first film); For what it is worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this is reused by musical signals that appear from his soundtrack to the previous movie. If you've been sticking with this review so far, realize that this is one of those movies that is so incredibly bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either dismiss it in an incredible phrase or spend an unworthy time dissecting its mistakes. I am sure I have omitted some of its inconveniences, but I would not forgive myself if I failed to mention the greatest single-grin occurrence throughout the film, which almost made me fall off my chair (yes it even surpassed the aforementioned animated titanic duel for me), namely the decor of the rebellious gods lair, which is in the form of a giant marble skull !! <br /> <br /> At this point, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) an assessment instead of a (not totally unjustified) BOMB; In the past, I have had many long-term online discussions about whether a star's rating of a particular movie should reflect the overall artistic quality or its pure entertainment value ?? But there are two cases where I found it necessary to be deliberately influenced by the latter in settling my final assessment. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm currently in a "sword-and-sandal" state (with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled in the coming days!) But after all, uncharacteristically, I decided to add these two movies to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit ?? And that alone must count on something, no?
