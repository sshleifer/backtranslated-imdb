This was on TV last night. I needed painfully through it and barely carried it through. First of all, except for Leroy, Hilary, and possibly Coco, NONE of the other students, we must be interested in having a familiar talent. It's like HSPA had no standards, just sign on the dotted line and you're in. The history lines were lattice and obvious. Doris was just terribly terrible. The gay guy was such a wasted clich√© (fun that the school only had a gay guy, right ...) I liked the Leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent the Leroy pack . Lisa looks as though she'd rather be elsewhere, and since she wasn't a talent, I wonder why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I would have rated this one star (horrible) but the music wasn't that bad and I liked the premise. It would only have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent.
