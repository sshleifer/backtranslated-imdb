Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally referred to B-movies, they are even over this movie. It fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear or fear - unless you count the fear of sitting through the rest of this waste. The direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movements that hide the fact that the killer is not as close to the victims as he attacks. And what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black cap. I liked him better when he fought with He-Man. This is one of the lazieste jobs of character design I've ever seen. I mean, it's Skeletor! And he's on a horse! This should be something scary, supernatural creation? How should we take it seriously? All we get is scenes of this guy running around in the forest on his horse - which he can hardly keep up with - mixed with scenes of soldiers shooting at random into the forest and thinking they can shoot a ghost. Occasionally Skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or drive past and stab a person and reveal how corny the effects really are. I generally enjoy Sci Fi fare at a basic cheese level, but this movie is too unobtrusive for any level of enjoyment. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him ???
