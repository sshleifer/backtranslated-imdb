Can be spoilers, so do not read, if you do not want to watch TV news, everything has already happened, a big tsunami weaves over a city bay and CUT, no more to see, Tokay suffers a big earthquake, so someone more than they 5 seconds, I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use a disaster movie title, please show me THE DISASTER, after watching this movie, watch JISHIN RETTO or a GODZILLA movie to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsed that didn't get a chance to do in this movie. Don't forget me, I love disaster movies, and I love the original Nihon Chimbotsu and Jishin RÃ¤tto, I also like the latest Poseidon, not too much of a story there, but a very good and graphic disaster sequence, Nihon Chimbotsu loses the point as many times as a marina or the day after tomorrow, but at least these two films show good disaster sequences and also with the expensive FX that didn't show anything, gives me false buildings if you like as long as you destroy them properly, I know I should sound like a sadistic freak, but I went to see love actually, as I felt like watching a romantic movie, grrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn't. there is also a tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975 i have on dvd and it is much better
