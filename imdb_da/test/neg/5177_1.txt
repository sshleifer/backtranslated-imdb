Guilty Guy Ritchie. The late 90's success of Ritchie's clich√©-knit Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster films where the genre never really recovered. Unfortunately, the Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Essex hardnut Carlton Leach - is unlikely to reverse that trend. Despite a decent lead performance from Hartnett, the film is the victim of all too familiar East End stereotypes. They are either busy blowing out the brains of others or shagging a sharply blonde. From the horrible football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties, Footsoldier charters Leach's rise through rows of thuggery. Leach becomes a bouncer where he leaves the terraces for night clubs, where he is given carte blanche to kick out a crap. Here he comes in with infamous gangland leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone), and begins to realize that giant war is not what it has blown up. <br /> <br /> It is fun to have deconstructed author-director Julian Gilbey's ridiculous join-the-dots yob patois, since each sentence seems to start with one, "I'm going to forget it?" or 'you pocket' ?? or sometimes "Then I only went a" union "??, which was typically concluded with a mandatory 'caaaant!' Also the direction strikes sadism, especially the obvious joy that Gilbey comes from capturing violent scenes in close-up and in the case of the bloody shotgun-to-face denouement in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Conductor Gilbey's use of the classic The gang-and-fall gangster story is not what will condemn Footsoldies to big-screen blurring, nor is the fact that half of the film sits on Leach for the benefit of events culminating in the infamous shooting of Tate and Tucker. It is Gilbey's morbid appetite for scatter-shot violence that destroys the movie, whether it is a brick on the face or the ax in the head during an evil attack on a train, it is all unnecessarily long-lasting. you feel offended and more important, rob you of two hours of life, you do not come back ...
