This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. It really does not qualify for movie status. It is very cheap (apparently shot at videotape), terribly acted and just plain clean. I couldn't believe how cheap and unobtrusive it was. It looked like a home video! I think I think a guy I know a few houses down must have dug his camcorder out and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. I noticed the name from where this came ?? Asylum ?? and i will never rent anything with that name on it again !!! When renting a flick, check if it is from this "company". One thing is true though - if you like horribly acted, amateur movies, then you like this loser. It is absolutely boring and terrible !!! You have been warned !!!
