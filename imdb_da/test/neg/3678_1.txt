I can't remember the worst movie I've seen. Total waste of actors and audience time. If you prefer to sit by your TV and think about when this movie is over, then this is the right movie for you. Perhaps this film is busy making people believe that Moscow has some mystery over. But I have to say that I didn't expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I expected more from Vincent Gallo. The film lacks a plot, character, development, denouement. The end movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique. I have to be fair there is some camera effect, but even that is too bad. Over and above are the same images. Everything worn out of time.
