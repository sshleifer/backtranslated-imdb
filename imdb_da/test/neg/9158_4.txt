This is a below average "whodunit" with cliche all in the living room routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service manager who does the government's work and he must find out who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat German U-boats in World War II. There is little to recommend with this movie, since neither the bomb nor the researcher or the war has much to do with the plot. Charlie Chan fans are likely to find this movie disappointing. Who the hell? So what?
