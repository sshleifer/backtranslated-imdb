That's what this movie really does. A great piece of cheeze. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde type duo who create their own party line to lure their victims in and capture them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for fun getting away with it? You come Richard Hatch, who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. A really bad version of a ladies man. And he gets involved in finding who is behind all the killings across LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and entertainment. But there are parts in this movie that really make me go as the stage with Lief Garret dressed in his mother's wedding dress, acting as a sissy in front of her sister, telling her he needs her and can't live without her and see as she strikes him over the face that dominates him. I can't believe it was Lief !!! Well, I think I could. But it is worth seeing, but only to see one of Garret's worst movies that he ever did.
