My brother-in-law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch video. This should have given me the first clue that it would be terrible. It was. From the very first frame, this movie is horrible. It doesn't even fully record as a "B" movie. Maybe an N or a P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. From the rubber raptor-on-a-stick to the still breathable body of the car to horrible closures so far, this movie is not worth seeing if you received it for free. <br /> <br /> Skip this hero - unless you want to play the Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.
