The movie starts well, it has something to do for it. Ca. 1/3 of the film goes downhill. Carrey starts occupying number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So what? There is no need to go for nuts and start writing things all over your body and on walls. It appears by the one who plays his son is bad. From the go, as soon as he hears about his father's occupation, he jumps on the band and is hysterical about it. Completely unbelievable. I hope I never see this kid in another movie again. It's a waste of time watching this movie. Grab another. Drilling piece ... well. The number kills him? Give me a break. I don't want to spoil the end for you, but let's just say it's equally disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
