This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations for this movie. I pulled it out of the video store stand with the movie, "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First, the credits for this stupid movie run approx. 5 minutes into it. The pacing from start to finish is slooooow. The main heroines do not like wearing a bra and the director seems to enjoy the jiggle effect when Anna Paquin goes down the stairs. If you like movies for boobies, it has a low buzz factor. <br /> <br /> Second, it is nice that the movie runs elements of Lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in better movies there is at least some rational or consistent irrational behavior. This stinker tries to create some sense of modernity and reality, but then you have situations where no one calls the police, even though they have uncovered a treasure chest of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and other world criticism is nicely spelled out in an extensive World War II book rituals like Buffy. I waited for Miles to show up and give some consultations on how to kill a particular demon type of it every now and then. The prerequisite is that it is possible to open the age of Darkness, where creatures that creep in the ceiling can cut the neck or turn the carcass effect on you. To do this, you must have a sacrificial circle and then have seven children who must have their neck savings on people who love them. This opens the world to the age of Darkness. It is at least what is in detail in the book of antique occult rituals. Which raises the annoying question of how have those who wrote the book, and if this is what happens, you would really leave this information in a book you can take out of the library, much less get it from a library in a world that is not already covered in the dark, an age brought on by lunatics who could have done this as much earlier by the "occult practice of bringing the world to darkness for dummies, 2nd edition"? It turns out that the father of history is the seventh child, the one who ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; He was released by his father, the doctor / grandfather of the film, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably other stupid parents who would just see if stupid like this opening world of darkness actually works. The grandfather let the father go because he "didn't really love him". Aduh. Stupid stupid movies written by a moronic director who seems to think he's a kind of Eurofilm author. There is also a scene in the movie where the child appears with great welts on his face, and the mother tackles him and has this total lack of response. The whole movie is like this. People who look really strange cannot continue and do not respond to it in any kind of normal way. Perhaps the bad plot and direction is. Anna Paquin does her best to play her character realistically without breaking a smirk, and she looks in a limp top, but at several critical moments in history her characters do not interfere with calling in for backup. You know more of the same: "I want to go into a probable demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others who carry lamps or firepower, even though I feel impending judgments." And even more stupid, as it may seem, even when you come to Dark age, these creatures that make you bloody cannot attack if you have a light source, but they work like people you know and tell you to turn off the light source. Reminds me of video games "Alone In The Dark"; Perhaps this movie is a rip off of that game concept. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the movie are the young child and Anna. They both die at the end. The whole family dies. The creatures of darkness lead them to their death, but truly the stupidity of the characters in the family was the greatest cause of death. The other adults can be interchangeable with other actors from the Red Shoes Diaries series of fine cinema. <br /> <br /> So, to unpack, the worst things about this movie are the stupid in the characters that come blindly in an overtly abnormal situation, the real crap plot (which is an ancient architect in history designs a house with a sacrificial age hidden in it - the architect suspects from the beginning that would be occult victims in the house, but does not tell anyone because, well, no real reason they could not find the children, but he did not disturb the authorities about the HIDDEN ROOMS, which he designed into the house, but he likes to hang around in the house for a 40-year period because he cares about what's going on inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), the chopped use of frightening mechanisms (more children are standing in the dark or only appearing in photographs and blood on the wallpaper) and the egoism of the director, as when you see him in the DVD functions describing his crap work as a new and original reproduction, you understand where the real horror of this movie lies. <br /> <br /> Is it entertaining? At 2x speed on a DVD player with the subtitles turned on, it can be entertaining until you reach the end and realize the movie is bad, otherwise it is about. The cinematic equivalent of a fat shake; The empty calories are awful. The film gives the feeling that the director must have seen "The Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in the mood, which in that respect fails the movie and so in this respect, Jaume Balaguer√≥, it is my opinion that you suck on what you do.
