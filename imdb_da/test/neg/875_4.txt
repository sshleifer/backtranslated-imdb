I had great hopes for this movie, even though I hadn't read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - should be good already. But the film does not deliver on the promise. I waited for more depth for the characters, and it wasn't. I have no problem with that it only took a weekend to fall in love. It can happen. But we never learn very well. I would have liked more focus on them. The movie reminded me of places in Bridges of Madison County and that movie was much better. I really felt for the characters in that movie, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that was not between Gere and Lane. Each of them is very good actors at their own expense. Just not the right movie for them together.
