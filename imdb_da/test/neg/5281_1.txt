This movie sucked on so many levels! Have you ever seen the dentist? This film made the dentist look like a masterpiece. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless of course you really really really really get bored, so maybe. It was so corny. The murderer reminds you of the grandfather of monsters, except he has goggles. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought she should kick her shoulder, but all she did was throw a dirty garbage bin on him. I was very disappointed. And when the ranking had the crying scene about his wife, then I felt the pain behind his tears ......... NOT !!!!! So before you see this movie, take a blanket and a pillow, get it comfortable because it is very relaxing.
