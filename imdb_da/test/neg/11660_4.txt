Like most musicals in the era, one has to check the reality at the door. Broadway MELODY of 1938 is not externally credible or credible, but sweet in its weird way. This movie is really just an excuse to perform the star's talents. Some scenes just happen as if they were in a review, not a plot-driven movie. Judy Garland shines and it's a shame she has so little to do unless there is much left on the rock floor. <One of the most frightening events is the way Eleanor Powell gets a major role in a Broadway show, and Robert Taylor says it will be work, work, dawn work to dusk. Several scenes pass by and there is no work, no repetitions ... NO. She needs money to win a horse in an auction. She has no money. Does she not get paid while she is training? Taylor needs to borrow money to help. He was supposed to be a big time producer. He has no money ??? Anyway, these are just two elements of this strange story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are absolutely wonderful, saving this from being a total loss. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better, which is Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
