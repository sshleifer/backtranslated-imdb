It seems that if you have to write here, it will be a 10-star rating, no one ever seems to like anything, well I'm honest, some don't like it, but here we go, rachel ray show is just quite terrible. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of snl character linda regardless of whether she had a cooking - whatever show.i must say i liked rachel on the food $ 35- $ 40 a day but i'm sorry to she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out, give me ham on the street, anthony bourdain, interesting people, but most of all i find her annoying, she actually told a student age to "quit" yes in a fun way but closed is closed and who cares about his pet stories, sorry rachel you have been canceled !!!!
