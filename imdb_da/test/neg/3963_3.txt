You know that the movie could have been much better when the animal - in this case a small dog - is the best actor on the screen! The action in this movie is so bad, so amateurish, the dog was embarrassed to see this. He ("Rusty", our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the inhabitants here. <br /> <br /> Now it's almost a story: Child finds animals, pets are not wanted or wanted by one of the parents, but the "pet" wins out saving a kids and is now a hero and a official member of the family. Sounds good? <br /> <br /> I remember that this movie is a big hit, but never came around to see it until the mid 90s at VHS. I was shocked at how bad it was. Why so very busy with a movie? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early 70s that a lovely family movie was in the crowd? Optionally. There wasn't a lot of healthy entertainment in the decades of the 70's, plus many people are suckers for cute little animal stories. Who could resist this cute little dog? Not me. But the movie I can resist: It's a Grade B storylin with horrible plays. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for small dog lovers and I mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner will fall asleep, trying to watch this movie in this day and age.
