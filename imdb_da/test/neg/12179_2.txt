The secret service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been tasked with protecting the elected president's wife, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has her hands full. She is the victim of numerous attempts at murder, all of which are directed by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the first death. This movie offends your intelligence with not just the story line but also the lack of realistic places. For example, in the scene depicting the initial parade, First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the president. We also know what Washington, DC is like in January, and not just all "top coat less", you can even see some palm trees in 70 degrees and sunny weather! (Of course, filmed in Hollywood, not Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It's not worth your time.
