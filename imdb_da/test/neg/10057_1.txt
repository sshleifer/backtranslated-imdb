Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-driven private eye examines the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is employed by Jaclyn Smith, the missing husband's avid wife. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows well about her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her boyfriend, James Franciscus dispose of his wealthy hubby. What more would you expect from a raw slasher movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly raised by Sybil Danning until a giallo-style wrap-up brings the whole mess to a bitter end. This is BAD cinema. And this movie is sooo poor. It makes it look like Halloween mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this. Rated for graphic violence, nudity and sexual relations.
