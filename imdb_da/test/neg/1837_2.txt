First of all, this film works in that it is disturbing. I really didn't like to see all those scenes where people are cut up alive, etc. The weird erotic introduction gives a sense of necrophobic wonder. It's something ... uncomfortable for me personally. But the film really works in that respect and it is suppposed to be scary so I give it credit for it. Yup, a couple of points for the scalpel and .... well, damn disturbing idea of ​​being disected alive. <br /> <br /> But what this movie lacks is an interesting plot, characterization or real surprises. The entire teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple, predictable way. Lots of 'tense' moments, creepy guys who are crazy, and the big question of all: is the girlfriend the killer? This movie fits into the category "Scream" and countless others who have spawned over the 90s. Well, I do not want to spoil it for you, but it is not interesting who is the killer. We find out who it is halfway through ... and from there pulls the film on and tries to fill a time ... pretty boring to say the least. I look a little at the watch on this movie. <br /> <br /> The lead actress is good as usual, but the sign box she's placed in makes you groan in pain ... the college girl is a detective who everyone thinks is insane, but she's the one who really knows what's going on. And the police? Ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, disruptive at times and most of all boring and boring ... It's like an American movie company took a flight to Germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign ..... hmmm ..... Or did they? <br /> <br />
