I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world's premier in the small cinema in the Triskel Arts Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found "Strange Fruit" to be an excellent movie. It's a bit rough around the edges, but for a low budget movie that can be expected! Generally, the actor (especially from the lead director Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and the direction excellent, and the writing is very entertaining and thought-provoking, with some nice settings and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit sudden, without any conclusion being drawn to signs and events when the final came to its end ... but maybe that movie was the filmmakers for? It definitely made the movie more disturbing. I liked that the protagonist never came to terms with his mother on the screen. It lets you wonder if he ever will, as in fact sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally packing it up! <br /> <br /> Tight and exciting everywhere, "Strange Fruit" is a huge ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what the writer / director Kyle Schickner releases next time. He - and his colleagues - is a talent worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I hope "Strange Fruit" will get a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with some original and insightful phrases about homophobia and racism in America's Deep South. Highly recommended: 7/10
