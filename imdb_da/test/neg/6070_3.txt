Trite and unoriginal. It's like someone saw Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them together and start stealing other formal plot parts from other movies to make another. As with most historical films today, there are some inaccuracies, as history is manipulated to better fit the story, which is understandable for the most part. For example, in the remaining days of Beethoven's life, others needed to write down what they needed to say to understand them. It would of course have been a pleasure to show on the screen. The script, although full of some quoted lines, does not quite capture the feeling of this time period, and along with some bad plays it seems relatively modern. Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at, but she still has a lot to improve on her craft. Ed Harris doesn't work for me as Beethoven, and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for that. Overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life. Better just find yourself a copy of immortal loved ones. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
