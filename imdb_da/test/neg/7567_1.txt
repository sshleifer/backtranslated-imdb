If I could give this movie less than a 1, I would definitely do it. I had read a review of this movie in the LA Times and I found myself going to the theater and remembered the review. My wife and I were games and we thought it couldn't be as bad as the critic said - you know critics. Certainly ... Give me a break with the horrible spectacle, horrible camera work, bad use of the budget (which has been mentioned again and again as an excuse). I have been working on movies with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It is the director and the producer who make film work - they choose the teams. That is it. If they don't put it together and make it work ... it simply won't. So they didn't - and it doesn't. I don't think they can ... I had to take the time to write this review ... though I'm sure the movie staff doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I do you all a favor with my desire to do well, but - in another career. Good luck.
