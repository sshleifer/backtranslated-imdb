I wouldn't normally waste my time criticizing a useless movie like this. However, I am out of work this week so I have plenty of time to give way to meaningless trivialities. To begin with, let me say that I often enjoy non-commercial, non-mainstream, non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supportive filmography.) That said, there are lots of bad movies released in countries outside the US. Believe me, I have been tortured by hundreds of them. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. The open half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneration. This movie gives some classic morals that belong to the same level as Kim Ki's "Bad Guy" (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. Women actually enjoy being raped; 2. Rape should be glorified, praised and respected 3. Do not rape any woman you like, because while you "do" her, she will eventually begin to suffer and reach orgasm 4. If you are a wife, raped, be sure to extort his rapist for much money, but if he does not pay, just repeat his lock of a wife as compensation; 5. If you are a wife, get raped, be sure to turn it down and break it down the next day while playing the role of rapist and put her on lines like: "Do you have this?"; 6. If you're a man is a rape, just accept it; 7. When you are personally raped, you must be friends with your rape and hang out with him whenever possible. How can anyone in their real mind worry about any of these signs? They are nothing but a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways, but actually fail in their meaningless and supportive ones. Don't get me wrong. I am very capable of enjoying movies that depict lifestyle and morals that are contradictory to myself. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting portraits of sado-masochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is a highly perverted game of child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a disgraceful accusation of traditional marriages. Even religiously-based films like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) have entertained me once. The difference is that these films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development for them, while "Lost In Beijing" hardly has any. It is known that humans with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet, but without any kind of character development or psychology behind the actions themselves, you end up with a superficial display of contemptible behavior. Why, exactly, Bing Bing is eventually friends with and cares for his rape? Why does a rapist's wife accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never disturbed telling us. Even the obvious compilation of rich and poor classes was incredibly conceived and eventually served as a simple situation conflict. It feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening hour slows down. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason why you can't choose which person to fight for is because they were not properly developed. Don't think this movie has complex characters just because they aren't clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they are not clearly defined is because we do not know anything about them or what they think. This is hardly a positive feature of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the camera work and the play is pretty good, but everything else just becomes obscure and obscure when the movie progresses. You can place this along with the trash like "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time Is It There" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002) and the aforementioned "Bad Guy."
