normally i would say i loved this movie. Not to act, even though it was OK. Not for the script, which was so-so. The reason I would usually love this movie is for the intense action that starts from the get go and does not end to the final credits roll.but the problem with this movie and I felt it was a big problem was the horrible CGI.it Looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the effects shots. Many of the effects look lime, they are in their very toughest form. Since it is clear that they did not have enough money to finish the film, they should not have released it. I found the effects insulting. It seems that they didn't do not care about making a decent end product for the consumer. If it wasn't for that, I'd give this movie a much higher rating. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
