This movie was so horrible, I don't even know where to start ... The only positive thing I can say about it is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. The whole movie was everywhere, there was no explanation for the cause (only theories) of outbreaks or rationales for their solutions or why it would work. That was ridiculous! All the signs and relationships between them were so cheesy, you just want to laugh !! There was just no background for any of them. The relationship between "love" seemed to have been added to the script, it was so awkward. There is an army man; great black general with a permanent cigar in the mouth with "AaarrrGH! I'm the man!" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. The two sidekicks that were supposed to be geniuses appear as two 16-year-old frat boys. And then, to create some action, they decide to put a stone on a person's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he coughs as if he were dying of pneumonia or something ... and then playing altogether (supreme scene of all! !) to help the plan to be done, who knows what ... it's never a good sign when you find yourself laughing in the midst of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; do not waste your time!
