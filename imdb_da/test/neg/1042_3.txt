Leased this a mistake by believing it was another movie with the same title and realizing that I had rented it some time before. <br /> <br /> Quick plot line. A couple consisting of an artist and photographer hires a studio apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez, who still curses the fact that his brother Martin Sheen could actually shop! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted by a creepy serial killer from the 1930s and his last victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, first improving their sex life, but eventually becoming more threatening. <br /> <br /> What follows is cheap R rated sex scenes, cheaper excitement and a little waste of time.
