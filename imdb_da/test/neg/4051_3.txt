The film is about a day in the life of a woman who goes crazy. To show that she is mentally ill, she overcomes much, and the narrator tells us she is "angry". Along the way she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he can be Orson Welles' brother, and he later takes a header from a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a strange little movie made very cheap - and it certainly shows. The film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or other inexpensive type of film) and had some sound effects and an indulgent story added later. In fact, the story was the most intrusive and unintentional fun I have ever heard, and that's said in such a stupid and over-the-top way, you just need to hear it to believe it. As a result of these cost-saving actions, it is not surprising that the film is poor, although the idea of ​​trying to make this kind of film was quite original. And it's very hard to do it throughout the movie.
