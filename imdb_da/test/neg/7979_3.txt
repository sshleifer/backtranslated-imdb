This was my very first "Bollywood" movie, and I found it the same way many other recent viewers did - through "Ghost World". Having done some reading on Bollywood's film industry this week, I understand why there are apparently unrelated music and romance and comedy in a horror movie. But "something for everyone" does not always add a coherent product. The ultramodern musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" has fascinated the world in a way that it probably could not have done in 1965. It is over the Internet now, with many people scrambling for a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does a great job of dancing after taking, so it all looks fresh, new and fun, even when any normal person would be exhausted! She rules! <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss Kitty is a light fun and beautiful tune in total contrast to the horror plot. Yet I find myself singing it in Hindi one week later. I found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> If you want to live in this life, then listen to what I say, leave your sorrows behind and join the party, take my advice <br /> <br /> them who wants to Live with laughter and song let your hair down and relax people in this world, what do you know? come to me and i will explain <br /> <br /> who is there to see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and there <br /> <br /> My Another favorite number in the movie is Butler's Dream, where Mehmood is attracted to Miss Kitty's dance. The electric tiki-like idols are just wonderfully sticky, just like the whole set of this number. Online, I had seen it described as what would happen if "Liberace threw up" !! It is fun. <br /> <br /> Gum name is not a good movie as a whole. That's why I gave it a rating of 3. It's actually a real stink of a movie with some fun, kitschy tracks that have nothing to do with the murder plot.
