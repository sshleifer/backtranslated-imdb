Gene Hackman is a former marine corps colonel who patterned a handful of private Vietnam veterinarians to return to Laos and rescue some Americans who have been listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that half a dozen or so MIAs are secretly kept in a remote camp by the Laotians to be plagued and to work harder. Hackman is paid by the rich Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is believed to be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and dated weapons, even though he manages to pick up help from an avid communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way. <br /> <br /> I don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to join the myth of the Vietnamese who still have our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was really enough. If anyone remembers, there were many bumpers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIAs. Instead, I think the movie was made partly to get into the myth. It was absurd on the front of it. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is propaganda value in something kept secret? To add labor supply? They need a hundred extra workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this movie - with its triumphant music and high body counting - were scary. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Stripped by its theme of saving mythical mistreated MIAs, it is a routine paramilitary action, no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one who manages to hold his head over water. He is almost always reliable. Of the others, who are a formal plot derived from "The Dirty Dozen" among others, I kept trying to guess which of the gangs would sacrifice for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I thought one or more were dead meat. Therefore, Asian helpers appear in movies like this. (I was right twice out of three.) I also counted Patrick Swayzie as a beginner, the youngest in the group who would never "earn the respect" for the others because he had never seen a fight would also have to Go in some heroic state. Wrong. He becomes a hero, true, but survives intact. I thought there was a fifty-five chance that Hackman would also go, but he does it okay. The formula also does not extend to originality. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW escapee from "The Great Escape" is here in Fred Ward's ex-tunnel root, a claustrophobic that has to crawl through a drain pipe with a snake inside it so he can make a reconstruction on the Laotian POW camp. <br /> <br /> The title "Exceptional Valor" is from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men of Iwo Jima - "Unusual valor was commonplace that day." Nimitz was right about it. Whether the men who fought in Vietnam were just as dignified is far from that point. Anyone who saw battle or even approached it, put their lives on the line for the boys in the line next to them, were heroic enough. This film, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam War, doesn't make them really right.
