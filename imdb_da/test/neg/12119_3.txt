I loved the very last Bellocchio movie, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". It had a fantastic manuscript, great actors (it may well say that Castellitto is so much bigger than others), a brilliant use of light for a great movie. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is another story. Ridiculous manuscript uses tons of morals (and we could talk weeks about politics, you know we are Italians ...). Bad filmography (it's too simple to represent 70's dark years with dark colors and dark light, making some effort more people !!!!). Bad use of music: What is the purpose of using psychedelia to represent Brigate Rosse's tragic rationality? <br /> <br /> And to all the people who claimed the main prize in Venice, I answer: "Are you nuts ???" Maybe the Russian movie was bad, but not as bad as this. <br /> <br /> I'm down with P.E. Don't believe the hype !!!!
