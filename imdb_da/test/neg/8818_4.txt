I have to give this movie a 4 because of a few things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I call it "stupid victim syndrome". If you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun - please shoot him. If you are a policeman and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back - please shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to push. This is one of the first things they teach in small arms training and the reason why you don't put your finger on the trigger until you're ready for fire - ask any hunter or infantry. If you are electrocuted, your muscles must also contract - so you pinch your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It is really hard to lay the floor completely for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - not feeling you are not dead. Even more, if you probably die from a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - the guy he injected with poison who was to receive the antidote. If you poison someone, it's murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson that he should learn? Yes, the doctor should be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something. <br /> <br /> Other than the things I would have given this movie a higher class. The reason was pretty good and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible action on the doctor's side - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The camera and soundtrack were very good, but the ending seemed designed and just didn't work for me. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to see this, or I would have demanded a refund.
