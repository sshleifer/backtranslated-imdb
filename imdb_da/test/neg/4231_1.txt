The protagonist, Pharaon, has suffered a loss of his wife and children in the pre-film past. He deals with just closing emotionally. For a long time a movie, too much time spent on the Pharaon's inexpressive face, too much "road time" (one of the paths of television: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) Long scenes of him make trivial - sometimes completely inexplicable, invisibly trivial - actions with neither reason nor feeling. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this movie might give new meaning to the term "free sex"); Domino and Pharaon's mother are the two characters that show some emotions, but not much. It's hard to tell with all the characters in this movie: is it indifferent play, indifferent writing, or simply indifferent characters depicted by good writing and good acting. Signs in this movie speak very little to anyone; It is no wonder that they are emotionally isolated, which is the more bizarre because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
