Grass, that's my reaction to this movie. I really hoped it would have been a good modern slasher, but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers. Instead, it tries to be something, it is not, which is a psychological thriller, and it fails so badly on this. Even the title "Freak" suggests that this may be interesting. Match this with cover art on the DVD and you think "OK, maybe I'll give this one a try". Not worth the time. In fact, the story begins a bit interesting with a poorly deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head, combed by his fat mother. She shouts at him and surely strikes him, since in a scene we see, she actually let go of him for no reason. After all this he decides that he has got enough and smashes her face with (I think) a stone. Today he is now in insane asylum and transferred. On the way he goes out of the habit he is in and escapes. Also introduce the 2 leading characters, a little girl and her older sister. They move and hit the road. So most of the movie is that they drive around in the car, talking between each other. But the bandaged "Freak" is now loose and is about going on a rage of cruel murder! (This is completely sarcastic to me) <br /> <br /> I can't believe how boring this movie turned out to be. The budget was the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialogue I could just break down on. This is one of the films where the packaging is better, so the girl herself. And to compare this to Halloween?! Nonsense! I'm not even the fan of the Halloween series (except the third), but Halloween is far better than this. At least with Halloween, we have a good score and some really crazy moments. With this, there is almost no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing scary about this movie. Maybe this movie would have gone better if it had a solid score, because even the worst movies are tolerable if the music is good. It's just my opinion of the movie. I thought it was just a complete waist of time and money. But since the movie has over 4/10 rating on IMDb, there must be people who like this movie. I'm not one of those people. 2.10
