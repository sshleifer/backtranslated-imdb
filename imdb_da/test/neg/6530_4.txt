Starring Tomas Milian and Manny Perez ?? 'Washington Heights' is a low budget drama in a Latino neighborhood in NYC. <br /> <br /> A young cartoon artist (Manny Perez) wants to escape his Latino neighborhood. When his father is paralyzed by a robber's shot, the young man is forced to drive the bodega family. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in a budget (low resolution and poor sound) with low profile actors. The plot floats well for 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes were just awful. We don't know for sure if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel ended up in jail for the shooting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
