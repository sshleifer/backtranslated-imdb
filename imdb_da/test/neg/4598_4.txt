For some twenty or so years ago, Charles Bukowski was my hero. I blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I never had to face the intellectual types that prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They could usually be found safely behind the counter by hipster video stores and record stores. These people barely spoke and when they asked a question, they usually cared and nodded in a certain vague direction. They were useless when it came to finding a particular title, but their shelves were always filled with strange and unique titles. Being started in the secret hipster club, I thought I had to throw my bourgeois education and encourage counter-culture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski started with the movie Barfly, the late 80's movie starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He was also a kind of modern male amazing anti-hero, a brooding intellectual type. At that time, this appealed to me. Barfly's totally scoffed at the convention. A fifty tramp that lives life without ties corresponds to none - Oh - and recognized as a genius by a warm female literary snob, icing on the cake. Afterwards I read Post Office and Hollywood, the later Bukowskis take on his experience with the movie. Now I allow to accelerate to the latest movie based on Bukowski's book Factotum, which I read and enjoyed. Bukowski has the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski began. Twenty years after Barfly, the fictional film Bukowski is still the same. I've seen about an hour in the movie, and I haven't yet seen any signs of the facade creep. Here's why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is beautiful (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean neat hair, styled but not over the top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski goes from job to job, ignores and / or struggles with different bosses. He screws two floozies, of which he lives, goes on, only to return to with a little repercussion. Chinaski is his own man, and we never see him emote. He is a sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something, James Dean archetype. Factotum is for the viewer. It does this by annoying the idea of ​​a man (an author). A poor man suffering for his art. What could be cooler than that? Now let's say there are some truths to the Factotum when the events took place. What the audience lacks is the pain that protects Chinaski's existence. Perhaps this movie, and most movie's point, is in 80 minutes. We have to escape the world, which is full of consistency and pain and admission with an antisocial woman who smokes, speaks, drinks with freezing chills. One who rejects conventional behavior of jobs and family. My hero used to be Movie Bukowski. Long ago it would have worked. It was so easier then. Now I still have a claim for a hero. Things are not that easy. Hipster logic and movie renderings of counter-culture icons offer no solutions or even ask questions.
