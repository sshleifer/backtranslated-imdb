This is a classic B-type movie, you'd rather not waste your time and watch. It started well, and I thought it would grow up like a good thriller, but I failed. Throughout the film, you get the feeling that soon something interesting will happen, and it suddenly becomes an exciting thriller, but it doesn't happen. It runs slowly and peacefully to the end, with nothing interesting in it. Only the end was unexpected and original, but it is. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this movie rated R anyway ???
