"On a clear day you can see forever," is no more than a New Age update of the "Pygmalion" / "My Fair Lady" story: A professor is trying to make a common girl a senior socialist. This time, but instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnosis and past life regression. You know that a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and costumes before they mention the plot and the music. The songs are immediately forgettable. (No "Get me to church on time" here, I'm afraid.) And the plot goes nowhere. To rewrite Gertrude Stein, who is not "there" here. The characters wander through history without getting from point A to point B. Professor Chabot repeatedly claims to come to the root of Daisy's problems, but he never seems to. <br /> <br /> All meaningful conflict is avoided. For example, there comes a time when Chabot's university demands that he either stop his reincarnation research or withdraw his position. Now there is conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Alas! Nothing comes of this development. A scene or two later changes the university and tells Chabot to continue his work. So much for conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent was decidedly for this movie: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Posted, Partly by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast by Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And oh yes, starring Barabara Striesand, who was almost on top of her game at this time in her career. <br /> <br /> But it all falls flat. Lerner's attempt to revive his greatest success, the previously mentioned "My Fair Lady", is so doomed to fail as Daisy's attempt to revive the glory of his own past. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movie music, there are far better choices than this.
