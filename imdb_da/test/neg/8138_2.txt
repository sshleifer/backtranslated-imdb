This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this guy who gets a curse on him, and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little sad because she was not a gorilla's bride: she is now the gorilla's wife. She should have married him when he was a gorilla, as the title would have made more sense. There are also all these people in the middle of the jungle and they all want to leave. This is not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. I didn't even see bananas for a wedding gift. Oh, he wasn't damned yet.
