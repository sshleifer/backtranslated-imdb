It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appears in really bad movies. Joe spends most of the time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. He takes orders from a puffy considered death angel that you might recognize as the puffy to the villain of Tango & Cash and as the soft face cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do, and it involves taking some souls of some kids into a big car driven by a stupid bile that questions Led Zeppelin. Well, the car is running and the chase is on. The lucky kids to escape from Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are hunted around the city, breaking things and Tonya is taught by her mother while she is dressing for a bath. The action wins in a hospital where we learn that heaven is a lift ride away. Eventually some green lights flash, Joe shouts and Puffy disappears without a trace. Wish I could say the same for this movie. See it from the relative safety of the MST.
