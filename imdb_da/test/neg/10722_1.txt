Part of the film's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we must endure. While this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pain it doesn't need to be stressed. As a result, fun with Dick and Jane is not a suitable title, and I was just disappointed to fail to see any fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but it fails to perform, and the title was not appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> But if the movie was resumed to be "Steal's art" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy takes more on the robbery and the plans to steal (stupid of course) would have given the film a big boost. At the same time, the film must at the same time show that the CEO at least initially is a villain so it will be easier to project the pain to someone responsible early and just leave it. The film suffers from a point of view problem and with that in mind, a comedy cannot work if the point of view is not done correctly. A scheming man character who is the one of a Wile E. Coyote on Road Runner would be more fun, including slapstick comedy. But in this case, instead of catching the bird with complicated contrasts, a steal would be very fun here. I think you can make many of these and put them in the movie. But since the point of view was made wrong, the robber part had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the movie for the first 15 minutes (under Jim Carry's big rise), but to do the trouble they had to face to be more comical as it is a comedy, that's the part that requires a major revision. It could be more fun if the problems were more like John Travolta's civil action during the downfall. That movie was a serious one, but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.
