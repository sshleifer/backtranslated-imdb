When I looked at the cover before I saw it, my expectations were not high, especially as it was among the other crappy horror movies on blockbuster (along with movies like Junior). Okay, it doesn't just make the movie have the brain-free stereotypical characters (the rich shower bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the local, who knows what's going wrong in the city, etc.), but has such god-fearing dialogue, action, governance and CG effects . Jeremiah Stone dude was fun. (* SPOILER *) I never understand why he put his finger out of nothing when he kept chicken up hostage. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the movie is as terrible as the other errors. From what I could get out of it, Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger under the Gold Rush and a notorious crime. He had a crapload of gold, (* SPOILER *) and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before being knocked down by the locals after killing a girl, but not only did he survive he hit his finger and ran off. So today there is a group of unclear morons that find out about this gold mine, and of course they are warned by the locals about "The Forty-Niner's Curse". And what do they do? As expected, the warnings ignored and greedily searched for the gold. They get the gold and all s ** t continues. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the bitch gets her head cut off. <br /> <br /> It's about it. Looking at the film's cover, you can see what kind of movie it is going to be. It's just so terrible it's fun. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
