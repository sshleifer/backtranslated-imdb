Wow. I've just seen Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, in fact. <br /> <br /> Never before has mankind seen such a free change in makeup, for not a shameful cause. Or similar, so very bad zombie (?) Makeup that makes you hungry for the halloween green marshmallows. Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then there was "The Shining." <br /> <br /> The reason here is so amusing that it actually holds a little bit of charm, like the dialogue. The last shot of the movie is just so silly that it is without description. It's like a drunk college student joined with some friends and decided to throw Bruce Willi's type of dialogue along with (I guess?) Teenybopper dialogue from some Elm Street movies. The result is smashing, and it would be great fun if it were that way. <br /> <br /> Oh, hello. I still want to laugh. <br /> <br /> Hell, come with your friends and see it here. But be sure you are full first. Or you can become insane. Especially if you are a college film student. <br /> <br /> Bowl.
