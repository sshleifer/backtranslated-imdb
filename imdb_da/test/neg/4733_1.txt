Where to start ?? I think only three other movies have made me write a review on IMDb and all of them were positive. As for this ..? <br /> <br /> Disgusting, fierce, tragic, embarrassing, disastrous, stupid, annoying, utterly and utterly horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm STUNNED this was made, never mind a theatrical release. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I'm not a "snob". I don't expect beautiful filmmaking or intense character dynamics, but it's really beyond a joke. We just have to demand more from the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the black death.
