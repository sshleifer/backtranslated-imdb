I won't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then it got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey, who tries to cope with a new wood brother, Derek, and his tall royal family, while gradually strengthening the princess's standards on each one. <br /> In season 1, the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey when she was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was blessed and deep. I felt bad when she was harassed at her new school by her new wooden brother. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and she dated a lovely guy who is now portrayed as one of Derek's idiot friends. The season seized the true excitement that the title of the show was trying to capture. Now I can't say that the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting, but I praise Derek instead of Casey. Now, there is little if there is any interaction between the two siblings. If they interact, it is only short. Oh, and I don't want any Dasey fans in my face. People called INCEST, even if they are step-siblings. My tolerance can only go so far, but it is not the intention. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek, as an antagonist, has become more sensitive over time, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikely than before. I like how the younger children get more time, but the parents are even more clever than before. But that's not the biggest problem ... Unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from Casey's point of view, with lame, nauseating background music. She has become stupid and superficial with time. In an episode she was whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalric, so she deliberately dumped food on herself and blamed Derek. What happened to being a strong, independent feminist? I haven't seen much of the fourth season, but I hear she is dating a guy named Truman, who is a jackass and is arrogant. Oh, I remember the nesting episode. She reminds him constantly that she doesn't like him, freaks beyond being "gone" by a sword, and eventually chopping with him because she can "handle" him? What the heck? Why go with a guy like that in the first place. The first season Casey just wanted to beat him in his ... against. Or maybe it would have been my reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. Not that is a bad thing, but I think she fell on one of her practices. And in a prom episode, she cried because she couldn't find "dress in her dreams" and was not completely satisfied before she became a prom queen. One thing I noticed is that it doesn't matter how badly Casey is trying to tell us that her life is, things are almost always in the way (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some kind of revenge, people all love her, etc.) Derek is still quite immature, but I see that he has really matured. I can't see why many people hate Sally. She seems nice, and it's good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than "playing on the track." He also treats Edwin a little better and is a good brother to Marti. <br /> <br /> Really, the show is so-so, and I rated it low because, despite a character development, the character I once admired has now become like any "fashionable teen queen" you can see anywhere on TV. But it was good while it lasted.
