I saw this episode with great hopes after looking at so many people's "Favorite episodes" list. I don't boast in any way, but from the beginning I realized that they were in a kind of toybox / can with the big eye that looked down on them, to the type of character in there. Although the whole episode is the question of "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What's out?" Carrying the excitement of the episode (which I unfortunately already found out), I have to say that different types of characters and the interaction between them made the episode interesting enough. Though history's twist may have been harder to guess if ALL of them were (toy) soldiers.
