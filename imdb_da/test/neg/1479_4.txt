So boring you will fall asleep after the first 20 minutes. Sorry, Mr. Boutonnat, I admire your work (all these beautiful "movies" you instructed as "Tristana", "Sans logique" etc ...) but here's the plot extremely ... in vain! Aside from the magnificent photograph, everything looks silly and there is no envy to know what will happen to these "medium" actors. In addition, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "where are the kids" repeated as often as it looks like a farce. Trust me, it's a waste of time (about the plot), and 3 hours is a long time. Certainly the reason for this box-office overall mess!
