Excuse me, Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case you really laid a 'Golden Turkey' egg. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin that appears more wood than a Giant Redwood, and I think the direction was non existent. <br /> <br /> There were certainly pathetic attempts to start other movies, Jaws and European Vacation to name two. <br /> <br /> If my memory really serves me Eric Idle played the same kind of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo were addressing this successor. In that case, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, no one can better Chevy and Beverley in their roles when Griswolds and Randy Quaid complemented them admirably in the previous movie. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid should have stopped National Lampoon while he was ahead.
