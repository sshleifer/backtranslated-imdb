"Nuts in May" may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Ed Wood still lived, it would be the type of movie he would do. To say that this movie is bad, it would be the understatement of the century. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels of bad I pass by; "It's so bad it's good" or "it's so bad it's GOD awful". This movie falls into the latter section. What little accidental humor it has does not make it the slow, difficult to understand, boring majority of the movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged Anglos take a trip to the countryside for some R&R and camping, where they met Ray soon Jim (I will explain later) who's tent is next to our biggest couple. Throughout most of the film, the two leaders appear on the beach, by a quarry and other exciting places. In between these adventures, they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism, fossil collection, the duty of a proper citizen and a good diet, all I want to see in a comedy. They live someone who will listen to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but pacing in some scenes is so slow that I sometimes felt dosing. Scenes would continue forever, and just as it begins to build and something is happening, the stage ends. Halfway through the movie I thought to myself: "Nothing is going to happen in this thing, it's really a movie about nothing". The characters are annoying and constantly repeating things. On one side I felt the director playing a cruel joke on his audience. The scene I refer to is the "Sing Along" scene. Here our two fantastic Britons play some of the musicians for us, in fact it was the same 4 four lines again and again and again and again. The idea was to get Ray to sing along with them, but Ray knew, as well as us, that they are the worst songwriters known to man. This scene was over boring, at the fifth time the song was played, I began to question the existence of a gracious god. Words cannot describe the horror of this movie. The first thing that hits you is the unimaginable British accents that most of the cast has. Remember the thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Times it at 10. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, our tree hugs, coherent, couples into a fight with some of Ray's friends who have complete respect for the camping rules. Our hero is so spoiled that a climatic struggle arises between our hero and the main hellraiser. To solve their dispute, they involve two men in a pole fight. This is really a huge fight! Now this is where the accidental humor begins. I laughed so hard at the incomplete of all that I thought, "This can make up for the other 80 minutes." After this hysterical battle, our hero is running behind some bushes to cry out the eyes and the other man calls Ray by calling him Jim for some unknown reason. A sting game, a weeping nature that loves 40 years old and a character name changes 3/4 into the movie, Ed Wood would be proud. Although I was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes, which sum up ends with a long shot of a pig. Why? who in hell knows it. In a moment we see a pig grazing and the next credits begin to roll over the screen. One of the worst finishes for one of the worst movies all the time.
