I can't really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie. A woman meets a man he wants to play games, even she, but only until she is aware of what she is missing. She leaves, and it really is. It took 9 1/2 weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke). She should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery.
