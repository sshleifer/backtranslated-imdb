The alleged "scream queen" Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes travel west to the title scene and encounter pig murder, which turns out to be a cult of former Confederate psychopaths trying to revive the South through a meaningless massacre. <Br /> <br /> Action and excitement take a back seat for lots of boring dialogue and uninteresting character development. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good in the city's roofless meaningless roof (but nonetheless meaningless) role, but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor, including the city and fort, both of which look like modern western tourist traps and costumes that were similar to those purchased from Party City. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a big favor and see Ravenous instead.
