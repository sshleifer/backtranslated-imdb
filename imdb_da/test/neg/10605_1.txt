OK, number one - this "movie" is a "90's" version of a 70's crappy show that no one remembers! Number two - As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was as if I was going halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it's just not credible for me that the small, skinny Omar Epps can hunt down a big adult man without a gun and scare him to talk! It's a ridiculous "plot". I'm sorry, but for me, kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone catch some "evil, underground, killers". I went out of the theater and demanded and got my money back! I reccomend this movie to anyone over the age of 12!
