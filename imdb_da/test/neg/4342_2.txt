A cheesy "B" criminal in the early 50s, the story is droll, the characters tree, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sex pots that make it a striking but short shot, just a few frames long , showing an "electric" train crossing the river on the State Street Bridge, of the 6000 series Pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950s painting scheme when they were delivered, as they were new in 1950. For traction fans like Me, the one short take worth the picture. I think that movies like this, Ulmer's DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, THE FUGITIVE with Harrison Ford and others of the film noir genre (dramas in urban crime) make it interesting if nothing more than the fact that I know Chicago and San Francisco intimately and recognize most of the street rankings. Second, it's a really dreary movie!
