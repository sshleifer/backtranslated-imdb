Jeez, it was very boring. The leading man (Christian Schoyen) must be the worst actor I've ever seen. and another thing, if the character of the film moved to America when he was ten or something and had lived here for over 20 years, he would speak much better English than he draws from here. or to say it in my own language "Really broken". But it's cool to see Norwegian dudes in a movie made in Hollywood. It was just a shame they were talentless hacks. The story itself is below mediocre. I suspect that Christian Schoyen made this movie just to live the dream, which he clearly does in the movie by hopping a beautiful treasure after another.
