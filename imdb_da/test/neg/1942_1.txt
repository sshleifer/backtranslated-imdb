This is by far the worst and most stupid show I've ever seen on television. It is almost physically painful to see an adult (well in his twenties) doing nothing but torture and mocking his parents, who always seem to have no idea what is ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their dimwitted son and his just stupid friends. Of course, I know his parents are in it, but I really hate how they always seem to be caught quite surprisingly. It seems false through and through. And I really hate the entrance to the show, where a voice over asks "Bam Margera, what will he think of next?!?!" (I think this is the case anyway), and Bam himself answers, "Whatever I want!" - WOW! Bam is really a hell of a raiser - living at home with mum and dad! - Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced with a tasteful beep, but we get the message. Bam is the real dealrebel - at least in his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his posb of numb sculls are aimed at a teenage educator, and of course it's an MTV show, but please raise the bar a bit. It is painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing more than boring.
