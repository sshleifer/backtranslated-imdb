I saw this movie by accident on television and it was so terribly terrible that I couldn't turn it off. Every joke and intelligence has been removed from the Oscar Wilde story by the monstrous scriptwriter. It hardly means because the violent, clich√© camera work and cloying music would have destroyed something that looks like a decent script anyway. The worst achievement comes from Patrick Stewart, who comes across as the most hammy, talented, less mock-Shakespeare nincompoop as the ghost. "Get out of here!" he screams at some point while he waving his arms like a pantomime villain. A really horrible movie, and why does Stewart ask who can act when he is called upon to do so, has dirty his reputation by making worthless pieces as such and XMen.
