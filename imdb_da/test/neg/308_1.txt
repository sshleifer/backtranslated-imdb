This would have to be considered one of the worst movies all the time. The film was screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the screening I would not only refund my money, I also wanted the 1.5 wasted hours in my life. I have a very broad level of tolerance when it comes to assaults on a European film production, but this is one of the films chosen for festivals based on the cinema's reputation alone. This film proves that while such choices can satisfy the filmman's and the selection board's ego, there is absolutely no pleasure for the audience. There is no sign development at all, the plot is a distorted mess, the style is invisible, the shot is terrible, and editing is worse. At the end of the first wheel you will wonder if you went into the wrong movie theater, and at the end of the third wheel you will ask to be knocked out of your misery. This movie is an abomination.
