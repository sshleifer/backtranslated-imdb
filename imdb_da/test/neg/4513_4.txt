As a devoted wife Frank, I remember being so excited that the game was restored to television. It was until I saw it ... This film is a good example of how important casting is and how instructor plays such an important role in creating the purpose. Casting any key role is CRUCIAL for a production of this kind ... shows that AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the lead actor's charisma. And in the film of this movie, the whole thing is destroyed by Melissa Gilbert's terrible casting in the lead role. There is not a single thing that Mrs Gilbert even comes close to inhabiting Anne-Marie's sensitive, mature spirit. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the film. The only time I was close to tears was during the reading of Anne's most frightening line: "I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart" - this is spoken by Mrs Gilbert so hastily, so lack of conviction that she might has a good burp and achieved the same effect. Film and dance legend Marge Champion was a dialogue coach for this production - she should have refunded her salary! Despite the fact that Gilbert destroys DIARY, other performances are satisfactory for the most part - special kudos to Joan Plowright like Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the deeply rooted soul and spirit of Otto as the creator of the role on stage and film (Joseph Schildkraut), but he is okay. Doris Roberts and James Coco as Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts - they are sharp and bombastic, but again only on the surface. This may be because the pacing of the project is too hasty (as mentioned in previous posts) - this movie clocks for 45 minutes shorter than the movie version - the difference due to the pauses for dramatic effect, which apparently needs to propagate appropriate MOOD to the story. This is NOT mandatory viewing, especially for youngsters learning about Anne Frank for the first time - stick to the original movie version and, or better yet, the TV production by ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley the easiest thing to capture the heart and reality of Anne's situation ever filmed! Note: Particularly terrible is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister Margot, is NOT included in the opening credit with all the other members of The Secret Annex ... she is listed in the post credit with the actors playing Miep and Mr. Beads. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I would have driven!
