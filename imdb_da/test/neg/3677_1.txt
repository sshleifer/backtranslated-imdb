Wow .. where do I start I rented this movie because it sounded like something I'd be interested to see. With a name like Val Kilmer starring in this movie, I thought how bad it could be? This must be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a big name attached to it. I wondered why it threw through the cracks, and I never remember hearing anything about it when it first came out. It starts off well and reminds a little about the intro sequence of the bourne identity, but after the first 30 minutes it goes from bad to worse and then it goes into the WTF country. If you have not seen this, do yourself a favor and do not rent / purchase it unless you are a masochist or in search of all Val Kilmer movies out there. There are many more titles out there that deserve your time more. This movie (if you can call it that) is a bona fide waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
