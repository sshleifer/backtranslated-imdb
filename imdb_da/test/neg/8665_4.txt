Is it just me or are most of the players in this custom miscast age? <br /> <br /> Even though a superior actress, Jemma Redgrave seems to be joining her kids instead of nodding on the couch. (I would have loved to see Brenda Blethlyn in that part, her connection to the latest Pride and Prejudice, regardless.) <br /> <br /> Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only two I felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance. Everyone else looked confused or out of place. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I'm not very familiar with Dr. Who (I have only seen a few episodes so far) or it would certainly provide this further. <br /> <br /> Too bad Mansfield Park has not yet seen its grounds on the screen (either large or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully.
