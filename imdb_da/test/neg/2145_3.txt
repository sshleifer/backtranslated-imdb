His significant charisma and commanding presence is all about keeping that move, but Fred Williamson has made far better city-active films including many of his later, wide-release tickets. The early-mid-70s Williamson films of the large studios rarely had their mid-level counterparts, and this is an excellent example. Clumsy action, little violence, and PG assessment is not far from questionable. Worth looking for Hammer finishers in any case.
