As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, "Get me out of the door." I would definitely vote for this movie on IMDB's worst movie list. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California, peddling his brother's jazz records. He must be a barney located in the only local surfing community. But he seems more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There is also the continued adventure of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. Duke's (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert trying to get TT to act as a normal human being, the nasty drunk surfers who cheat their boyfriend and the guy who bets with another, that he can live by car for six months. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It starts out as a typical seventies, complete with bad 70's music (though this movie came out a year shy of the 80s). And Dennis Christopher comes as the most irritable loser, making the movie difficult to see (keep your finger on the fast-paced button). Although this film was about the surfing culture, the surfing scenes are almost complete waste. The people in the surf competition look like they can't fall asleep. <br /> <br /> I suppose the only cool thing is to see Tanya Roberts out of his role as Midge on sitcom "It's the 70s show." And Cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie.
