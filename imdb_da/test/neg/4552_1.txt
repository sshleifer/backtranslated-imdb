Okay, let's start by saying that when a Dutch movie is bad, it's really bad. Something with little quality (Lek, Karakter) rarely comes here in Holland, but not often. Costa! are about 4 girls who go to Spain to go on holiday, party, get full, get laid (you know the drill). It's also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro is trying to lure the spectators into their club. I'm not sure how long it took to write the script, but I assume somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you see a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long. Nothing, and I think nothing is credible in this movie. It's almost too ridiculous for words to happen to the story. Suddenly the movie turns into a kind of karate action thing. With a one-on-one battle with 'the bad guy in black' and the cliche car hunting scenes through a water tank car (it can be more cheesy). Also the words character development and casting are unknown to decision makers. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Traffic" 3 days before this, I fell from sheer sheen, from a work of art to this. This is film making at the worst. And don't start with a low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems that the filmmakers were busy attaching themselves to making a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever the chickens in the water at the end made it a little, but for the rest of it, don't waste your money on such waste.
