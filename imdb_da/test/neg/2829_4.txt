After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday newspaper, I hoped it was not the usual duff movies that were given away because no one would ever buy them. I was mistaken. Sheens plays are on a par with a 10-year-old school pantomime production, as does the majority of the cast. Neill is satisfactory, but plays a Russian and is not helped by his hybrid Northern Irish / New Zealand accent, nor the rest of the KGB characters, which all sound like they are in a Cambridge Footlights reunion. In fact, the only people with genuine accents are extras that deliver a strange word here and there, helpfully letting us know at least where in hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash. The espionage factor is most impressive and consists mainly of Sheen, who confuses in various ridiculous aprons while trying to interfere with the background and quickly becomes not only boring but ridiculous. The reason has potential, but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. This could have been so much better.
