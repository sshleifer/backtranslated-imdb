simply i just looked at this movie just because of Sarah and also gives these 4 stars just because of her on the other hand This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theacting was horrible. The script was uninspired. This was a movie that held itself against it. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. It's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. It didn't even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst is, the more I think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more gaps we still find. A real shame really, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurks in there somewhere ... I might be a little tough and give the movie a 4/10, but considering the actors involved and again SARA obvious writing talent , this movie really should have delivered much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a shame, I can't tell it differently. You know, since the beginning, it's going to be shed. The story, the dialogue, the action, special effects, make-up, pretty much everything sucks. I like vampire movies, and I know they will never be Oscar-winning movies, but it's not even worth seeing, I can't believe how anyone produced this thing. It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... does not exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they were trying to do, but I doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to pull, but it was just one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life (and I have seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this) favor and DO NOT see this. <br /> <br /> PS It's also full of clich√©s! P. S. 2 bad script, poor instruction, poor filmography. P. S. 3 I have bothered to comment on this as an advantage to everyone.
