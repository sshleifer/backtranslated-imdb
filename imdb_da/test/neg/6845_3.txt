This movie was so stupid and slow, it was ever slow. The only good part of the movie was the girl in the dense shinny gold pants. There was no go whatsover and what is an 80's horror movie without a little gore. Plus, the murderer was not at all scary nor the murders. But if you like to see the world's worst horror movies, then that's for you. Don't waste your time as I saw this.
