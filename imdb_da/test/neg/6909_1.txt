My boyfriend and I decided to watch this movie after we had heard on the radio that it was a good movie to watch, even up there with "Cars". For the first ten minutes of the film I was horrified. Initially, the cows, who were to be women, had male voices. Then I realized that they really should be guys. I set aside the transvestite queues too little and tried to continue watching the movie with an open mind, but it was just so grainy that I couldn't avoid shaking my head. I've probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was nearly over. The reason was decent, if not predictable, but it took a long time to reach its point. I had trouble sitting through it and I'm 19. The kids in the theater actually went up and ran up at a time. I felt like part of them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was filled with drinking references, not to mention that the cows / bulls actually stepped in and stole a car, then drank and drove into a boy's house to push him out of bed. (However, he deserved it), then ran away from the police, as the film's authors looked like horrible people. This is not the kind of thing I want my child to be exposed to. There is too much of it in the real world, if I wanted my child to watch boys drinking and driving and hunting the police, I would pop them in front of 10 o'clock. Children's movies should be an escape from reality, not a escape in ridicule. What happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast of? That's why Disney's old movie, such as beauty and the animal, the lady and the tramp, the little mermaid, etc. classics. If you want your kids to see a big cartoon with pretty much the same plot as "Barnyard", rent "The Lion King". You can get a great story without the horrible drinking and driving and grand theft-auto references. The authors of "Barnyard", of course, attempted to continue the great tendency to make a children's film that a parent could also enjoy, but they did so in very poor taste. I would never take my kids to see this and I suggest you save your money and see something else.
