When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was so angry. It blew in my opinion. I didn't see it for a decade, so decided what the hell, let's see. I see all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. I guess it was with successor 5 who was the first to complete the whole "I'm in a dream of seeing strange things, oh no what's happening, oh it's a dream, oh that's not a dream, oh wait i see something creepy, oh never something "-carious story. These sequels do not even require the box to be opened, or adhere to the rules of the first 4 films, that if you saw pinhead, you are pretty much screwed and dead. The first 3 hellrais stayed with this story, which made it so scary at first. No imagination, nothing strange, the box was opened the boom, they came. Kirstey was the only one who could negotiate it, first because of Uncle Frank. Then because she had information about the cenobites. This movie at least tries to hold on to everything, even though it was a bad story, it was still a hellraiser. No, I'm pretty sure that part 5 was the first part to completely and completely destroy the Hellraiser series. Now they are remaking 1, and I don't even think I'll see it. Oh, who I am kidding, I will probably and probably be disappointed .... again.
