Considering they wanted to make a vampire movie in the room, I thought, "Well, it'll be pretty cheesy, but at least interesting enough to see another take on the whole genre." Oops. I don't care what kind of movies you like; Even if you are the biggest vampire, horror, thriller or suspicious fan in the world or negative, if you have never seen a horror movie before and would expect your first to be impressive in any way whatsoever ... you are wrong. I don't think I've ever seen a "made for TV movie" or after school especially this bad. I have never seen a TV pilot show this bad. I have never seen pictures of animals sleeping or shitting, as bad as this. This is by far the only biggest waste of hours you could otherwise use to consider the importance of towels and their impact on your life. I'd rather be trapped in a bathroom for weeks with nothing to consume, but my own urine and excrement than even see a single clip of this movie again. When you looked at this, I felt like the fates that the characters fell into rather than dealing with knowing that I was paying money to see it. However, it was like a train wreck: so bad you just couldn't stop seeing, hope something good could happen. It didn't. For God's love, if you or your friends - even if you use illegal drugs while doing so - even consider watching this movie, instead, choose a contest to see who can shoot a snot rocket anymore. It will give you much greater enjoyment and entertainment.
