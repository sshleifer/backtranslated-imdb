In the effort to make a somewhat comical but serious film about the art of marijuana cultivation, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) fell a few bong cracks of a good movie. While the casting is nothing short of amazing, this film is extremely difficult to sit through. Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch couldn't even save this movie from failure. It would be wiser to flush three single papers down the toilet and then check out this movie on the local video store. <br /> <br />
