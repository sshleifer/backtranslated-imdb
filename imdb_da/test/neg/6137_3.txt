Picking this up along with the rest of Marx Brothers box sets, I found myself disappointed with most everything except A Night at the Opera. This stink is prolly the worst I have seen of them so far, with the clever lines omitted and the characterization being boring. The actor is so indecent stupid in this game, it's hard not to cope with the television and try to stifle him. As it is, the Marxes seem to be doing better, as outsiders have come in for destruction and are much better when they have a good gag or two at least. The material here is clearly written for everyone, and it really wastes Marx's talent. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
