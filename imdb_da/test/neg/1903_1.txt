Plunkett and MaCleane are two highwaymen who rob from the rich to give to ... the rich; By comparison, they are the rich. But we know that they are the good because the chap behind the law forces, Mr. Chance is just as bad. He rapes women - or tries to. He turns up his subordinates. He commits murder. He has bad breath. He doesn't shave properly. He has no sense of fashion. He tortures whale animals. The last one is just an introduction to me: In fact, we do not see him torture whale animals. But I'm sure he does. Little of Chance's villain has much to do with his practice of Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby he picks up to be absolutely sure we don't like him. He doesn't have to have tried so hard. No one in this movie is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Appealing characters? There's no one: I think we've covered it. Swashbuckling? Not a swash. Instead, we have some kind of ugly heavy breathing. Dash? Flashing? We do? Everyone has gone in the way of swinging, I'm afraid. Realism? None of that either. I think they were trying on realism when everyone was so dirty, but the signs and actions had the whole plausibility of Errol Flynn - without encouragement to back them up. Beauty? Nix. Nice camera work? For a TV staff, maybe. Humor? You can giggle once or twice if you are in a benevolent mood. Then again you can't. Dialogue? See "humor" above. Music? Don't even get me STARTED on the music. The music in `Ladyhawk 'was, in comparison, improperly suited; and at least the misleading aesthetics of that score was a coherent one. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize for "Ladyhawk" for thinking about it in this context. In summary: There is a lot of positive badness here and nothing good - unless you count Liv Tyler, which I have in two thoughts about doing it. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've just written a pox review. "Not so good," the review says. It would be much more interesting if I could somehow defend the poxes, to claim that critics of the poxes got it wrong - but I don't know how to do it.
