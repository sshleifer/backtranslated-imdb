In the picture, this movie looked like it could be really good - it is not. <br /> <br /> Casting is pretty good, but most seemed to be embarrassed all over. The real disaster in this movie is not the flood but the script. It tries to include all the clich√©s in the book, all incredibly bad. The ending is very steep, but it is a blessing in disguise. Congragulations if you do so far. <br /> <br /> All three main actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) would surely agree that this is the lowest point of their career. I hope they have paid a lot of money because none of their reputation comes out. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same was done for much better effect in The Day After Tomorrow. <br /> In short, a pointless exercise. Do not waste your time.
