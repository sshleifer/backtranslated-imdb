After watching the Steven Spielberg version of War Of The Worlds in theaters, I was hooked on the subject. I could think back to my favorite parts of the movie, people being vaporized, people panic, fire, explosions, it was so good ... So a few weeks later I go into my video store and I see David Michael Latt's version of War Of The Worlds on the shelf. "It couldn't have been on DVD so fast, could it?" I told myself. I read the back of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell instead. "Oh, I remember him from Outsiders!" So I thought it might have been an attempt. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, dead wrong. As soon as I saw the opening credits, then they take forever, I knew something was wrong. Something would disappoint me in this movie, and it did. The whole film stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. From the play, the special effects (stupid-looking tripod things when people are evaporated, turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it is not even as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact the plot was boring and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What shit? I ended up getting so sad that I had to fast-forward through the movie until I found something that looked even more interesting. And nothing was real. <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't even touch this movie, stay 100 meters away from it. The Spielberg version comes out at the end of this month, buy one! But thank you, thank you! Stay away from this turd before it throws us all together!
