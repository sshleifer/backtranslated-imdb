I have loved the book "A Little Princess" for most of my life, and was very excited that there was a movie. But I was appalled by this adaptation. Not only is the play wood, and the plot is a mish mash of different events in the book, but the theme is all wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can only be a princess when she behaves like one that Sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 bowls to a beggar child, even when she is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses, which less expensive Sara's actions considerably and seem more to be written on a Hallmark card than applied to this story. <br /> <br /> There are many other things that are wrong with this movie - too many to list, but here are just a few of the larger ones: This story must be set in the British in the mid-1800s , not America during World War I. Miss Minchen is tough for Sara from the start and does her actions when Sara is motionless much less frightening than they would be if she were syrupy in the beginning as she should be. Nothing is mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father * * doesn't come back, he's dead. It is his closest friend and partner in the diamond mines, who finds Sara and restores her to her right place. In fact, the diamond mines are not mentioned at all, even though they are the source of Sara's fortune. <br /> <br /> Throughout everything Sara has faced, she always seems like a princess and gives what she can and forgiveness for those who have hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia a "snotty two-bully". Such a thing is completely out of character for her and undermines the whole philosophy that she must be well-behaved, no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that I have ever seen (with the remarkable exceptions to "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne of Green Gables, the continuing story") The book's plot is wonderfully and skillfully written, so I do not understand why the director felt it was necessary to change to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone who wants to know this story should see the 1987 version, which is much better. Or read even better the book. It will be more worth your time than one and a half hours wasted on this version on the movie.
