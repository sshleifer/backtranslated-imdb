There is something wonderful about a "revenge" movie. Everyone wakes up in the morning to believe that he is the star of the "movie," and that anyone who interferes with his own personal agenda is somehow the enemy. Revenge plot film works particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Instead of struggling back in the moment, "totally" draws on inner inner anxiety to engage in a single power in an attempt to restore balance. Naturally, in the "real world" this kind of revenge rarely suffers from the excitement because life is not a movie; After the revenge is adopted, the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge girl helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the films, the final credits roll and all responsibilities are solved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming with sharks" is announced as a comedy, undoubtedly an action by the producers to find out how to sell this amusement. It's dark, but it's not dark comedy ("The Company Of Men" and Todd Solondz's works come much closer). Parts of the movie are so brutal that they predict the current "torture porn" genre that everyone is so obsessed with ("Saw", "Hostel"). There is some laugh. There are laughs in "Saving Private Ryan", but it's not tagged comedy. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this movie is that it hasn't earned its revenge. It is apparently about a young man being abused by his boss and ultimately taking his boss's hostage to "pay him back" for all that abuse. The hero (appropriate name "Guy") is an "everyman" so vague we literally know nothing about him ... what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes an ongoing motif through the film, undoubtedly inspired by the film's authors' own struggle ... "What do you want?", The answer that we are denied by a vague, cheated by an end)? It is very difficult to take care of such a sign, even though it works well (although Tom Hanks becomes a bug in the wrong roll, such as "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey as boss, "Buddy," is going to be a monster, but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laugh came when he mistreated his assistant - he seemed almost as surprised as the audience is probably what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is tortured, it is suddenly suddenly empathized for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a learning monster without rationality. At this point, every message the author had had been lost; There is no "hero" in this movie, ergo, no reason to break at all. It is not a stretch to assume that this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film industry. I worked for a similar boss and can guarantee it's not that far out. I had similar fantasies of desire for fulfillment at the time and thought I was justified. I thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in history (actually the only woman - there seems to be about four people in the universe of this movie) just by being your avid naive self, that zeal has won awards and a boss abused you because he was a mediocre person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are just the demons of a person's personal psyche, and anger is usually based on self. As the film points out, Guy was so unhappy that he only had to leave. The film doesn't give any kind of insult, but "surprise" ends regardless. We still don't know anything about the protagonists, we can't even be sure what they said, actually they were based, and everyone gets the magic of having their cake and eating it too. In short, there was no point on this story on anyone but pointing out that (shock!) The movie industry can be pretty brutal. <br /> <br /> There are lots of great movies that tell solid and satisfying revenge stylish variations ("9-to5", "Working Girl", "The Devil Wears Prada") and not so much ("The War of the Roses") "The remake of" Hills has eyes "). This is not one of them - despite the fact that Benicio Del Toro has fun in the Emily Blunt role of "Prada" and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, pointless, confused and somewhat blunt creation by self-indulgence from a director who has a hope "has worked all over" now
