Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and I never looked at it again all these years. Pardon! that was bad. I am told that I have to write 10 lines, so I will put in a little trivia. Tom and Tuesday Weld were "introduced" to this picture and Tom was told to go to the premiere on Tuesday, but Tom said no, he went with Joan Collins and he did, and because he was only Tuesday, Weld was introduced. I found it very fun then and do it yet. The movie, while the concept was fun, and the actors in it were impressive, but some how it just didn't come out fun. Continuity was abstract, at best it was as if I saw two different movies at the same time, each running into the other. Sorry, Bob Gilson
