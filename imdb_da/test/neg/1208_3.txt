This movie is the magnificent 80's flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she is trying on something, they can be better than benefits. The protagonist, Doug, showed his skills in flying a Cessna plane, somehow resembling being fully capable of flying a jet and killing people. We all want a few million dollars to play with ... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the movie directors decided to make Iron Eagle ... not once ... not twice ... Not even three times; yes four times. Things to look the most at are the multitude'harmlywood end 'of this movie. Just when you think the movie should end after a cheesy end sequence, there is another cheesy end sequence. Then someone else. Absolutely a movie to look at to believe ... and maybe own just to remind you how amazing the 80s should have been.
