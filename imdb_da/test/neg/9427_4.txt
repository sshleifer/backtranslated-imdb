An anonymous movie that could have been led by anyone at all. Where is Anthony Mann, director of such classics as "El Cid" "the naked spur" or "the man of Laramie"? <br /> <br /> There are amazing shots of airplanes in the clouds, lovingly filmed. The story is very tired and almost completely devoid of dramatization. The couple lives an almost routine life, and the user complaining about June Allyson's wife's choice, IMHO, misses the point.With her less attractive look, her hear voice, she needed the perfect housewife script. At that time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not a single woman among the base staff, even in the desk jobs. All they had to do was worry about their hubbies who fought for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear, but in 1955 it wasn't hard to guess. <br /> <br /> One wonders why a young person who has never seen a Mann movie should choose this among all the amazing movies he made.
