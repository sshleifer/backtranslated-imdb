Where on earth do I start with the root that is Darkhunters? First, the script is one of the worst ever found on a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point, the supposedly terrible dark-haired Jack claims that Carol, the girl helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as "a steak in a burger". I would laugh if I made it up - but I'm not! Just as ridiculous is how Carol originally came to get the power to see how people die. A cat gave it to her when she held it during a car accident she had as a child. WHAT ???????? <br /> <br /> Secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat at all. This cannot be helped by the fact that all actions take place under strong, broad daylight. Not very atmospheric at all. <br /> <br /> Third, the play is really terrible, Pinion again proves he must speak in his native language to be self-reliant. Jeff Fahey is of course on auto-pilot, but how can blame him when he runs through a creepy Humphry Bogart imitation like Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We get joke that's just not fun). Credit must go to Susan Paterno, an actress I didn't know, she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other, more experienced actors to shame. <br /> <br /> In no way is it just explained how the human character can understand what Van Husen's character says to her. Of course, she has some degree in screwed alien language. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, a moment is well done, car crash involves Susan. The SFX is convincingly credible, and if it wasn't for the hilarious story that was due to this, it would have been applauded. All I can say about darkhunters is that the British horror will never recover from its endless decline, whose films like this continue to be made and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague, though the plague would be much more scary. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> p.s. The insights of other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are frankly fun. It's a weak defense when some claim "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". The letters of my name do not make you fool me.
