Hi! I am Sheena, an African (yet white!) Jungle tribal princess who possesses the incredible ability to turn into the cheapest, uscariest monster in the world (think 60s Star Trek aliens) by throwing seductive mud! When I first found myself in this terrible position, I took the only logical action: I made myself a torn jungle bikini to perform my badly acted antics. I enjoy Romanesque novels and tear each other from the occasionally unimpressive African warlord. And I would be referring if I didn't mention my (white, of course) sidekick Mr. Cutter, an American ex-military man who seems to have fled the US after his divorce. Can you say "ducking alimony"? Yet he occasionally gives distraction from my difficult life. I mean how many idiot blonds do you know who is also a threatened species of meat-rending monster? Despite my many hardships (plays are so hard!), I haven't given up, and after a lot of soul searching I've finally discovered my role in life: terrorizing sleepy television viewers who are so unlucky to have cable or satellite.
