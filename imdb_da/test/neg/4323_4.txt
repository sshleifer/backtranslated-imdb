Lon Chaney Jr. returns to timber together as the mummy Kharis seeks her friend, Annanka, whose soul now lives in the beautiful host of descendant Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, high priest of Arkan (George Zucco) leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of Kharis to continue their evil actions. Tom (Robert Lowery) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from certain future mummies. <br /> <br /> Routine predictable recording in the Kharis series shows that almost every movie follows a particular format / formula. The city is threatened by a curly cork that is masked in wrapping, which seems to have been endowed with superhuman power to choke life out of imperfect men who are relatively light at a simple Kharis evening. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action .. and knows a lot about Egyptian history. In the former film (The Mummy's Tomb), it proves that anyone who has survived a previous meeting with the mummy is sure to die if he returns in the next flick. Well produced, but lacking originality that would separate it from the other movies in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine sleeps through his role as the evil Yousef Bey. Insanity has Kharis, which is known to donate a crooked, lame right arm that carries an unconscious Amina with both arms for long distances without bad effects. One aspect, the shocking climax where Tom's attempt at the hero does not go as planned, when Kharis keeps her girl in distress, raises the film from the doldrums a little.
