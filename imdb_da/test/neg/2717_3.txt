I'm just happy. I like bad movies. I like movies with attractive young women in small quantities of clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie gives all the above a bad name. Yes, you know that what you get is not high art or something like that. But even for that type of movie, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. Some people have given it 10. I can only assume that there are people who have had the organs that allow rational thought to take place surgically removed. <br /> <br /> It's not very good. It is simply not very good. 3 out of 10 solely because of a) novelty value for the famous relatives and Burt Ward and b) some of the girls are sweet. <br /> <br /> By the way, did I tell you it's not very good?
