You know this is one of those "Emperor's New Clothes" movies. It's like, so away from the wall and odd that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into movies. Well, I think this is a bunch of Bologna. Films like this that hide under the dada or the cloak of surrealism make me nuts. Someone has this bad dream, maybe by eating the aforementioned bologna just before he goes to bed, remembering most (unfortunately) and putting it on film, and we must all marvel at their creative genius. I also have bizarre dreams, sometimes it makes sense, but I don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everyone to them and call it art. Weirdness does not mean in itself something interesting. True Dada or surreal expression has some intent and intellectual thinking behind it. If others don't, don't do it deeply, it just makes it unimaginable. Bizarreness for bizarre sake, for me it is not good, let alone great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" with "Delicates" is like comparing "The Godfather I & II" to "The Godfather III" --- same genre, NOT in the same league.
