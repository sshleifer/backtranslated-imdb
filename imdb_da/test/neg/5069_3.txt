I have come to realize by looking at this kind of movie that I don't like them very much. Caged Women is another "woman in prison" movie, and most of the rest of the genre; The reason is completely abandoned in favor of merely showing naked women. Now I'm not mistaken; I love naked women, but I also like to be a kind of plot thread to go with nudity, and since this movie only has the basic "women in prison" theme that runs through it (as well as the decisive escape, of course ), I got a little bored before the end. The movie is good because there is only a moment in the women's clothing, but it is about the only positive element. Director (and author, haha) Erwin C. Dietrich is looking forward to showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it is never very erotic. The director was the producer on a number of trash cans, including some directed by Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should keep on producing when his written talents do not exist and he does not know how to film a sex scene. This kind of material is pretty dry much of the time, but I think Franco could have done more of it. Overall, this may be enough for people who really are in this kind of thing; but I can't say I enjoyed it.
