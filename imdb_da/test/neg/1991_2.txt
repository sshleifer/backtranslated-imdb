I have to ask myself, do movies like this get their support from people related to the movie here and critics it? How can something so terrible score so high? My parents went to see many of the more adult theme films when we were kids, all with an R in it until we were old enough. I just remember two movies that had them say yech! when they came home. This one, and "Catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film consists of bumbling doctors and staff in a dirty hospital, wandering narratives and a pack of residents (resembling denials from the 1970s Norman Lear sitcom) staging a protest. The worst part is the "murder mystery", a crazy old guy doing "God's work" by killing doctors and others. When he admits, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only care about him coming out where he will "be safe and happy". A doctor who falls dead from a heart attack is packaged like the man so he can get away. Oh, my, what fun movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has not "make me think", chuckle or have any other feeling than "It must get better", but it never does. People wonder why it was a mistake, no wonder here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. Yech.
