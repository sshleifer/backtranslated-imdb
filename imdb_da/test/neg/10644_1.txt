Hellraiser: Bloodline is just such a movie. I think that's the fourth installment of the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the start and all I remember from there were some topless women and a boxing thing on a computer screen. But using my humor and intelligence (and the Info button) I quickly found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from the Pandora's Box, which I think is a gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> So Pinhead comes out of the box and terrorizes the "Toymaker's" family. And it's about it. Oh, and not to mention the random torture of various people who cross their path. Yawn. What mainly happens in this movie is that Pinhead catches the baby and then lets the dog out on his wife and then kills a random person. Then he comes man, blah, blah, blah. So what? Why does it fail because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too corny to be scary. Look at Pinhead's minion of creatures: a cheesy dog ​​that looks like it has been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are interconnected (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And someone who should be a princess of some sort. (I haven't seen the previous movies.) Now look at the biggest villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name you call someone when they're stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks come out of his fingers and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a grainy name and a corny speech. Somewhere in the film, two police approach him and say, "Let's not hurt you!" Pinhead Answers "Pain? How dare you use that word! I'm pain ??" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It sounds a little cliché if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the last half of the movie. The characters (and the audience) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. Someone we don't recognize (Maybe he was in the previous movies. I can't remember him at the start of the movie.) This scene is basically a thing that is played over and over: <br /> <br / > A guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise. <br /> <br /> Some other guardians: "Oh no! He's down. I want to look at him myself!" <br /> <br /> After he dies the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's what I didn't get. In the film, Pinhead is allegedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So how does he get back to four more movies? Are they prequels? Why didn't he die in the previous? Geez. The creators must come up with an idea for another series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes, but has little excitement or scary value. Just forget it. Bad special effects with bad otherwise everything else makes this more of a snooze party than a good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Well? Some people can enjoy the topless women in the beginning. Plus, the Pinhead voice is pretty cool. I suppose if you like ultra-violence, you also like it here. <br /> <br /> Poor: None of the above reasons make this a very good movie. Corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. And who names their villain Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.
