Construction workers interfere with the native American burial ground of a large cave skeleton monster that disintegrates the victim with that touch, breath or bone guard! The head at the top of the resort project, Krantz (Jim Storm) instructs his construction crew to keep their skeletal findings secret, too much would stop the continued development if the nearby Katona tribe caught wind remaining, being dug up and disturbed. An aging Bruce Boxleitner, who always likes half-breeds Sheriff Evans, tries to keep peace between Katona's and Krantz's crew. The peace was punished at best, but with the skeletal pattern running violently so that it became victims disappear without trace, Krantz will soon have an answer as to why the members of his crew are missing. It also begins to lose citizens. Evans is warned by Katona Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) that an old demon, Bone Eater, has been loosened and can only be stopped by a sacred warlord (... the ax was removed by a worker who found it back with weapons lunged inside ) Now in the back seat of her daughter Kelly's (Clara Bryant, wearing tight jeans and shirts to reveal how Dad's girl has grown to a quite striking lady) boyfriend's truck. Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing will stop ... and it must happen before Eclipse, or it will be powerful for everyone to overcome. <br /> <br /> A solid casting, floundering in an embarrassing scary excursion. The CGI is not very good, although the monster could have been quite threatening if it was done with a better budget. It rides a horse made of dust chasing after it's prey for Petesake! Some cameo appearances include BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evan's deputy Big Jim, STAR TREK's Walter Koenig as a coroner, and HOUSE's William Cat, as a Country Doctor who participates in the wounds of Evan's deputy. None of these cameos last longer than a minute or so .. really. Adoni Maropis impresses in a subordinate role as a fraternal Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use Bone Eater to drive the white man out of his tribal country. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a tasty dish of a Katona woman who opposes Black Hawk's hatred of the white man and wants Evans to follow his Indian blood to put an end to the Bone Eating monster. This can be worth sitting through if just to see Boxleitner dressed in war paint and Indian robe. I felt for the actor, to be honest, as Bruce is trying to keep a straight-face in such a horrible movie. In yet another overtime and tiring clich√©, Bruce's Sheriff has a strange relationship with her daughter, whose 17th hot and wants to dance the "bad boy" .. even though this is a signed subplot, most of the plot of the killing skeleton and many of the poorly developed figures.
