Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money from a movie, even if they have to continue to pull out stereotypes and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of this, and I really believe in my heart that a movie like this is racially irresponsible. History is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who has chatted with a lady on his computer, and when he finally meets her, she turns out to be the opposite of what he had expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a beautiful black woman who does not intend to dance Peter, but rather to look at her cases where she was convicted of robbery. He wants her to trust well, but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and in order to save her job, he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts that involve her case. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter has his children living with him and Charlene turns out to be helpful in raising them But suddenly a news bulletin announces that a fugitive convicted named Charlene Morton has broken out of prison. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI comes snooping around, but he calculates that she is actually innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Adam Shankman, who keeps things moving at a good pace, and it's a beautiful movie technically, but the manuscript is just as unlikely and every character is a stereotype to it point that a 1970 movie called "The Landlord" is clearly more in line with race than this root. I've always been a big fan of Martin, and I think he's one of the most talented people around, but he loves to work constantly and sometimes just seems to choose a script that is handed over to him. On the other hand, I've always had a problem with Latifah, and the way she goes into Martin's life is so over the top that she instantly becomes admirable. The basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is the hip black person who shows stretched whitey to loosen and then pass some street logic that will help them with their lives. It's basically what the story is here, but of course they must let Martin dress black and exaggerate like a delayed Eminem, because Hollywood knows it's what viewers want. Well, I was pretty much offended by everything in this movie and it's not because I don't have a sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood, anyway) I use logic and common sense when I watch a movie. Yes, I enjoyed Eugene Levy's talking jive, but do we really believe that he would be immediately drawn to Latifah? I suppose things have happened, and how many times is a head actor shot just to be saved by something in his pocket? Would a cell phone not crush if it was hit by a ball? Although your most daring Martin and Latifah fan, I wouldn't recommend it here. I know I've said this before, but it's not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
