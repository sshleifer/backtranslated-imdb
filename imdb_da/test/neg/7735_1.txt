Impressive show and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and the hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? <br /> <br /> I liked CTHD, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well-developed characters that still have enough space for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the DEEEPAA meaning of it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Hero" is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. The moral greater-end life was horrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your faith, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed ???? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> But Hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
