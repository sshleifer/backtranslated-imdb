The movie was disappointing. I saw it on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was excellent. Perhaps as she herself addresses the end of her musical career, her displaced desperation lands her in a role she welcomes, re-invents and tripples as her own. Bette sang is always the belt, always flat and lacking in showing her ability as an actress. To be entertaining, this achievement died for a stronger lead and a stronger throw so the others would be memorable in Bee's absence. Another criticism: she smiles directly into the camera every time she starts singing! I know that it is musical theater, but don't go a little socially - Middle can not function as Liza or Streisand, perhaps in a retrospective trip - out of character and outside context.
