It is difficult to determine who or what is the target audience for this movie. Jean-Pierre Limousin probably had the opportunity to explore the issues of amnesia at a serious level and instead chose to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles selector, who explores memory loss - albeit as a result of Alzheimer's - in a deep and heartbreaking manner, not least in Isabelle Carre's luminous performance, I find Novo an insult about See Souvenirs. I have no problem with soft porn in itself - and even though I had it, I would have to give up movies, so widespread today - but I have a problem with writers / directors trying to respect it by letting it be like here in the shadow of medical research. The sad thing is that the fine actresses like Julie Gayet - so wonderful in Clara et Moi - and Anna Mouglalis - who seem to have hit a double game after last week's Le Deluge and now this - wasting their time on dross like this.
