I had the accident to watch this movie recently and have to sit through it. A friend bought it for Â£ 1 and insisted that we look at it as it did well from the back story. <br /> <br /> 10 minutes in the film, it was clear that the actors were amateurs, and this was an extremely low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very bad, the script was silly, and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long, just so the movie would be of reasonable length. <br /> <br /> For example, when the protagonist hires a warehouse, the movie uses a ridiculous time on this scene, with meaningless dialogue that does not serve any real purpose or necessity in relation to the plot. <br /> <br /> The main actor is supposed to make revenge on a woman sleeping with boys to give them HIV, he never thinks about being tested. Instead, he turns into a crazy killer who decides to torture her before killing her and breaking her. <br /> <br /> If that sounds good and you think, it will get a lot of fun, think again. This movie has no real gory sequences and is pretty pretty for this type of movie. It doesn't scare it, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't give quick pace fun. However, it can put you to sleep, it is safe to drill you to tears, so please save the despair and follow my headline. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE 1/2 out of 10 (this doesn't even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The movie was 78 minutes, but seemed like it was 2 1/2 hours.
