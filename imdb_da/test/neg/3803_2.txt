I have accidentally got this in the intermediate channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the throw "groovy" haircuts aside and wondered what kind of movie could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? When I hadn't seen the original, I guessed it could be Poseidon Adventure, as it was obviously on a ship in distress. Was I wrong! I can't imagine for my life why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would have their names associated with such waste. There is no story, the show sees everyone forced out, the characters are a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and begin to pontify about the real meaning of life on par with bumper bumper philosophy. <Br /> <br /> It is only worth seeing the unusually horrible beliefs of such greats as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They needed the money badly. Can we blame the director?
