This movie played on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I looked for the first 20 minutes and then closed it b / c I'm sorry, but plot holes that are embedded in a movie's plot make the movie nothing but waste. <br /> <br /> The film is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bike out of the way, leaves for help, returns only to find out that it is called a hit and run and there is a hunt for the "monster" who wounded (eventually killed) her. /> <br /> This is a movie about a woman in a wealthy neighborhood who has 2 small schoolchildren who is an active social woman and yet for this movie to work, it must be credible that she does it does not own a mobile phone. Sorry, but it is complete BS, especially when everyone else seems to have one - they used their to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road - when our leading woman left the crime scene to go to phone 911 at some phone boxes. When the main woman returns, the ambulance is already on the girl's side, and there are chats about how terrible the person is who hit and left her. <br /> <br /> Only DUMB. Sorry, but I'm not willing to buy that woman doesn't own a cell phone that is needed for the movie to work. Please offend my intelligence movie, thank you. Perhaps if this happened in the 1970s or 1960s, I would buy it, but it is obviously a present day (1999 at that time) movie. .. but wait if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. The woman clearly knows the technology when she had computers in her house, the kids played games so the whole movie had to do was kill her cell phone in the car and make her way into another way to call the police .. out of a Mobile phone completely created just a ridiculous plot.
