I should have known better .. the tracks were everywhere IMDB.com. This flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record. Cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies. Etc. Suffice it to say that I can't see any reason why anyone would like to see this horrible amateur attempt at filmmaking. Turn on any broadcast channel at. 3, and you'll see better movies. Nuff said.
