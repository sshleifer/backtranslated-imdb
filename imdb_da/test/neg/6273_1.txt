My paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the DVD box summarizes: this movie was far more horrible than horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it was the Tom Cruise version. The ridiculously rough special effects on the menu screen should have turned us off. The gratuitous nudity that was already in the opening scene made us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But when the movie was on, we were embarrassed by clumsy plays - both over and under - non-continuity in management and editing, trite writing and raw special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; After starting this badly, it couldn't get any better. As I despise reviews that span a product without specifying, here are some examples of the movie's special unpleasant moments, even though they correspond to spoilers: <br /> <br /> - The management says goodbye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with her mother, the latter dots because it is their wedding day, but the lead does not come together because of sudden business. The son asks, quietly concerned, "Will I ever see you again?" Perhaps it is supposed to come out as a premonition, but instead it comes out as a creepy behavior for a child age in that situation. A large alien spacecraft has gone down to the ground and is sitting in a huge crater. A crowd stands nearby, looks at it uncomfortably, but otherwise looks generally uncomfortable. A woman finally says, "It's grim!" - After this craft has wasted a village and its inhabitants, the management and a criminal, now alone near their home and trying to load their cars into an escape, have an exchange something like this, in a quiet confused tone: < br /> <br /> "What was it anyway?" "I dunno ..." <br /> - A population trying to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military as part of the bridge is destroyed. When a foreign ship shoots an explosive substance on it, the crowd begins to run away, apparently only because a director told them and not because they are scared or in any form of real danger, let alone unusual circumstances. <br /> And so on ... write about the film lacking the experience of seeing it. But please save yourself, even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! The movie is so bad that it can't even be enjoyed as an inadvertent humor (as opposed to, says King Vidor's "Solomon & Sheeba" starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste to see such nonsense. There must be something more productive and comfortable to do, like walking the dog or cleaning a bird cake.
