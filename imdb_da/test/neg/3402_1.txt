Basically, this was, of course, designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible instructor who happens to be even worse than this documentary and definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, so avoid it at all costs. <Br /> <br /> As far as this documentary is concerned, it is entertaining; entertaining and blatantly misleading! Most of the "historical" movie recordings are probably just historical footage from completely independent events, which unfortunately were cut and inserted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would ever have been. There is no doubt that Waverly is a beautifully interesting place with lots of its own fascinating history, but the creation of a documentary to market the local area and its production is, for lack of better words, terribly useless. <br /> <br /> And I've lived in Kentucky all my life and I've visited the place many times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and there is no respect for this lame documentary.
