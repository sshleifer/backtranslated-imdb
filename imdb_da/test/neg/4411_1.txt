I know it's not original, but what hey? What more can you say about it? I feel unutterably stupid, just to pay attention to "From Hell It Came". The film makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests seemingly a matter of fun and dismissal, not the concern and alarm raised by scientists around the world at that time.
