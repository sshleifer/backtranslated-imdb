This is absolutely terrible. It's everywhere and nowhere and doesn't have any kind of point. I've never understood what's good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so over this drive, she must have been personal friends with the people involved because she hasn't read any part of this so-called "script" and thought "Yes, I want to do that!" Most movies I can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or fun. There is zero in this. It's extremely stupid. There really is no other word to describe this. It is probably the biggest waste of money on film production that I have seen for a long time. Skip it at any cost, you'll be glad you did.
