I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> It is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction, poor plot and 2-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br /> But I knew that when I went in. I was willing to trust the two gentlemen that I went with (knowledgable comic buffs) that visuals would be beyond normal and so were they. Unfortunately, experience of direction meant that the scene after the stage had gone a little in the way of dramatic excitement or conflict. Although this is a comment that could be made by many artists whose work is transferred to the screen, and who is responsible for the direction. The pace of the story is lost when the camera lovingly lives on the beautiful pictures. I would not have been at all without the assurance that the movie's style would be worth seeing. I have tried Neil Gaiman's work, but is always back with "Emperor's new clothes" feeling. I live in hope, but last night was no exception. I don't think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all his mistakes are described eloquently. However, I cannot understand how he imagined that he had an understanding of the idea of ​​a fifteen-year-old girl, and that what he might say added everything to the sum of human knowledge of adult living and taking on adult responsibility or changing relationships as a girl may have with her mother. These are the key themes of the film, and they are dealt with inappropriately, stereotypically, and without the depth of imagination. All the beautiful images in the world cannot cope with a work that is deficient in the core.
