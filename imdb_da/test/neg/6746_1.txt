I'm still trying to figure out what the goal of this movie was: 1) Whether to show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I can certainly add different adjectives here, but I think this is clear). 2) Whether to show how a twisted memory villain who does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) Whether to show whether a persistent detective will resolve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over for the criminal responses? 4) Or was it just to show that 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie? <br /> <br /> This was one of the movies that somehow disappointed me. From the first 10 minutes I found out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie prize, and surprisingly enough? this was consistent throughout. It was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupid it will continue and end? and I was not disappointed with it either. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete talk time? YES. Which raises your question ?? Why have I seen it all through? Well, I was trying to fall asleep and I thought it was a great candidate for it, but unfortunately I had too much coffee before that?
