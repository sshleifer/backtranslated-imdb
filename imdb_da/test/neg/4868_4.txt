My Take: Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable phrases. <br /> <br /> A rarely seen political thriller who made a very bad box-office answer, I managed to catch SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV right now and while I was happy that I met my curiosity for Seeing this rare movie, I didn't exactly feel that this movie was special. Given the box-office response to that, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as critics and the public responded to it, but it's still not as good to start with and everything from script to direction is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the president's assistant who finds himself trapped by assassins and chases (many of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy that lurks among the White House employees. After a professor is murdered, Sheen helps ex-flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) help uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak & Ric Gibbs, is pedestrian as they come, not very different from other white house-conspiracy players as in ABSOLUTE POWER and 1600 MORDER. Some significant talents (Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang try their best at a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. Not to mention a ridiculous scene involving a toy helicopter that seems too stupid and out of place in this "serious" political thriller. SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments I'm sure of which some are very underrated (director George Pan Cosmatos serves some decent chase scenes), but none of them raises this routine thriller where there is not much payoff or surprises. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
