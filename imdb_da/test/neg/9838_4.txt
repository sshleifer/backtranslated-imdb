Here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% of it that it was not entitled to be so challenging and frustrating at the end. Did the instructor decide to become an author suddenly, 80% by making this movie? Yeesh. SPOILER ALERT Thing typically starts enough for 50-year-old youth-away-wild; there are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the friendly old diner manager, and the city creeps. Things follow the expected road until approx. 15 minutes before the end, when the only sympathetic character is killed and the anti-hero is blamed (it would not be so unexpected if this was the main file of the movie ... but all this stuff begins to happen and unraveling during the last wheel! Major curve ball ). Then it gets strange; the friendly old codger forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody mass. The only presence of the hero's friend somehow pulls a confession out of the real killer - the lesson, crooked city nut (as in any real universe, he would have been the primary suspicion at first, even though anti-hero was found with his body). <br /> <br /> We are back with a somewhat weak "happy" end that is so out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes ahead of it. <br /> <br /> Even more strange is the film's insistence on playing homosexual induendo to the hilt, but constantly presenting the two male leads as equal. Perhaps this was on purpose - perhaps Bix's resistance to settling down with the girl more because of his sexuality (which in the 1950s was supposed to be fairly suppressed and thus not discussed or even admitted by him) than his need to be a "tramp". If the director's intention was to spin this as a sexual yarn - the driver is driving because he feels he is sexually excluded; that his paternal concern for Danny is not actually paternal but spousal; that his inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in a sexual disgust that even he does not fully understand - it could have become clearer. Instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoerotism and behavior that is completely heterosexual. <br /> <br /> These young men are sleeping next to each other, even when they have room to spread. When Danny is suggested (and even in bed with a woman), Bix flips out and takes him away. Danny pays Bix's way (that's probably another explanation for that, but it still hits a chord every time you see Danny buying Bix's lunch). They end up living together at the end. Not since Hitchcock's "Rope" has homosexuality been so obvious but denied. <br /> <br /> By doing this, MST3K did the right thing. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to praise the movie.
