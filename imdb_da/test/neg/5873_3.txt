I bought this movie at a store. Months before, my friend told me when we talked about silly movies we've seen. When I saw the cassette, I knew I needed it. I saw it that night. I could tell it would be very cheesy and cheaply done. . . That was what drew me to it. I popped it in and I laughed all the way through. I recognized Gregory (The Ice Cream Man), but I didn't recognize his name, and I couldn't remember where I saw him. Later, as he looked at the Andy Griffith Show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was added as an extra, as he is Ron Howard (Opie Taylor) brother. I saw the credits and I slipped. I turned to my mother who also looked at the show and said, "It's Ice Cream Man !!" She also gasped. This movie is great but only for laughs and criticism. It's the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick. If you want to laugh and poker fun on low-budget movies, rent this video.
