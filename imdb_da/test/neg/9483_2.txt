The boys were the most appealing things in the whole movie. The girls were lame and pathetic, I mean, how can they own their own clothes line, dolls, movies, producing studies and not smell this bomb far away? to get some kind of responsibility that I don't really see meaning in the punishment ... they are sent to Paris, far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who has an important position with paris. I really can't remember what he was, so who's really worried? the details do not help, the girls are sent to paris to learn something .. so what exactly do they learn when meeting two french boys and are able to manipulate the guy who should see them so they can meet these guys on scooters? The typical pre-teen movie that has all the pre-teens who want to fail and be able to afford the trip to Paris or some remote countries away from parents? I don't really like olsens anyway, they could never really shake the picture of michelle, on the whole house ... if you didn't, then you were lucky from the start. (F F-)
