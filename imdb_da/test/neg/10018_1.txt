The best thing about "The Prey" is the roof line ... "It's not human and it has an ax"! The movie itself is a padded stinkaroo .... endless insects and wildlife shots make the viewer die! No slasher fan will like this nonsense ..... See "Friday the 13th" again and burn any copy of this movie you find! <br /> <br /> It's also one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
