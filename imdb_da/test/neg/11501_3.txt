This is a good show to see, it's not the best or the worst. I've seen it for a long time, and I don't like any of the new things. This show has changed to some teenage waste and lives very differently. I do not like the gentleman .. I have no IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really fun to watch and was partly entertaining. The 2nd season is just outside this world stupid. I don't really know why the authors / directors changed this show. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd year. I will only see the first season of this show from now on, when I see a new episode, I change the f * ckin channel ... you heard me! It gets a 3/10 because I slightly enjoyed the first season but hated 2 and 3
