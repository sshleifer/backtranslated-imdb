This movie was so stupid I couldn't believe what I saw when I looked at it, it was like a big train wreck - I couldn't look away because it was just so terribly awful! I can honestly say that I have never seen anything so bad in my entire life. It was so cheesy and the actor was just so sorry that I just stopped thinking, "This just has to be a kind of joke, right?" No one would actually make a movie this villain intentionally, right? "I really hope it's just a bad joke, and these people don't expect people to see this with a pretty face, and I really hope that the people who were in this movie did terrible acts and didn't believe that they are great actors?! The drones are quite fun to watch, and then the osteopic special effects are directly out of a bad 80's sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> See this only if you already have seen all other movies in existence first and there is nothing left to see at all! i would give this a "0" if that was possible.
