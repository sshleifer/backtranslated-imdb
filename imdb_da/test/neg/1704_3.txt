This movie, if it had been done correctly, has so much potential. Parody movies are always fun, and people tend to like them because they are light hearted, stupid and stupid but funny. This movie was fun in some parts, but it could have been much more fun. The action itself was OK from all the actors, but ... I wasn't happy. It seemed a bit empty and my summary title says all about the effects. Correct green screens were not used for this movie ... backgrounds were added after which it was just as terrible. No wonder this movie went directly to DVD lol. It wasn't all a total loss, it's fun and will give you a good laugh (AT it, not with most of the time).
