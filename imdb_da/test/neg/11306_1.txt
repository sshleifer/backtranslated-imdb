I enjoyed Mr. Magoo cartoon I saw while growing up. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So I thought this marriage should produce a fun child. <br /> <br /> I couldn't have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was just awful. I don't remember a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (hundreds of films over the years) I have wanted my money back. You will leave this movie discarded because you will never have the time left to spend in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and act as a frame for the gags. This plot does not. It's just a little in there and is given as a stranded fish.
