I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the toilet. No respect at all for many important details that really make the movie. The names of some Serbian terrorists (as I recall) are, for example, Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names is that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What a name I laughed for days and thought about it. Probably an influence on Karadzic and Mladic. Second, there has never been any case of terrorism by Serbian people. A journalist whose main character should have known it. Third, the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs or they speak Serbo-Croatian. All this aside, this movie is solidly acted, but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense at all !!!
