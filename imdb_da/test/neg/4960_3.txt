It's terribly bad. I liked 'How do you want me', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's standup action, but I submit this with 'Hippies' and' Planets Of the Apes' (the new show) under ' Great pedigree 'went very wrong'. My guess is that it appeals to the same people who like 'Withnail and I'. It is overwritten, but to the small end, permeates a luvvie-ish air, and Bernard Black is simply a small camp Withnail. And I thought it was self-sufficient even * before * Dylan Moran became the author. But the setup raises such cartoon potential that in the first 2 episodes I did not even notice that it was not in the least bit chortle-worthy. The things they say / do * must be fun, but somehow they fail to register as more than mildly amusing or "I can see how someone writing this down might have thought this would be fun. " What I am trying to say is that the situations / remarks are mildly humorous and yet far too ordinary / gentle / self-conscious surreal to be worth creating and depicting in a sitcom. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. Avoid.
