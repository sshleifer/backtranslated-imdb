This ranks as the worst movies all the time. No research or thinking went into this movie at all. Action scenes were thrown into random intervals, which had no meaning for the movie. Elements appeared and disappeared randomly, etc. It is obvious that this was controlled by a "stunt coordinator" who was to go back to his old job. The skeleton man saved a horse throughout the film, which surprisingly could change color as desired. Either that or any believed audience would all be colorblind and not notice. Blood would be on the actors in a scene and the very first, disappearing miraculously and then again. Seems that everyone with this movie has forgotten to check inconsistencies.
