Rarely do you find a movie so bad that it achieves the often sought paradigm for having so little redeeming value that it alone makes it worth seeing. "Cyclone" I am happy to report is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew I was in something good as soon as I found the video tape. I am at least his fourth owner: It has a "Used Movie Sale! $ 9.95" sticker on the front, and a yard-sale sticker for a dollar. I picked it up at a fifty-cent store. <br /> <br /> The used movie sales! The sticker covers much of the front of the artwork, which means that what I see is a really strange blend still in front of cyclone's super bike, a car overthrowing fire and Heather Thomas, wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair with his mouth open in an expression that says, "I am an 'ooth ache." I saw it and thought, "All right." The case was honestly enough ("with nowhere to turn and no one to trust, Teri is thrown into a labyrinth of danger and "" but I surprised myself by actually getting around to seeing it. I always take the time for the really bad movies. That "Fight Club" tape can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. is an astonishingly well-designed character that we can tell from her introduction where she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and later her leg warmers, then Teri goes out to hang out with her boyfriend for the evening, which goes horribly wrong Before she knows it, Teri runs straight in in a web of lethal crosses in CYCLONE. "The VHS box tells it as it is. <br /> <br /> Left out of the box overview - perhaps out of a weak hope that the actual copies of this movie would be sold - is how terrible the play is. It might have been me, but I thought I could read the thoughts of the sign through their eyes. "It's stupid," says Heather Thomas. "I know," believes the bad guy with the foreboding mouth. <br /> <br /> A driving force (no pun intended) in the second half of this epic image is the car's chases. In fact, it was pretty good, although I tend to think that petrol does not need coaching on how to explode. What really impressed me is that the streets of all the chases were pretty much empty. It is as if there are only twenty people in this huge city. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking. You think, "Give Wilikers! I have to watch this movie!" The sad thing, though, is that you can't find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Just wait. Some days - maybe during lunch, maybe late at night, maybe "when military scientist Jeffery Combs (" Re-Animator ") is being murdered by hired snipers" - you will hear the smoke of legwarmers and know it's time.
