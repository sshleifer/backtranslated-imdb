Taylor Deemer Mrs. Dragon English 10 PIB B4 March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> A shot in the dark <br /> <br /> It's hard to make it through the movie Heart of Darkness, because it's incredibly unexciting. The book on which this movie is based has little action to begin with. So the thought of making it a movie seems like a totally insignificant idea anyway, which in principle guarantees a mistake. <br /> <br /> Most of the book is the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlow on a job through Congo's many darkness and people as a whole. I want the screenwriter to fail massively to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. It completely missed the biggest problem of light against darkness. It's the big point in the book, and when it doesn't translate into the movie, everything left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> This is the question, why would anyone make this a movie? An even better question can then be asked who would like to see it? It is quite a task to see. Had it not contributed to a character in my English class, I would never have considered watching the movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The heart of darkness is removed by all its insight and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. Novella is torture to read until the last 20 pages or so, but thought is that it's a pretty decent book. The movie is like a shot in the dark without the chance to hit its target. <br /> <br /> How can a book about the mental processes and the realization of darkness be portrayed in a physical and visual sense? I want it to be impossible to show thoughts exactly. I also like the time difference between the book and the movie creating great points that don't seem to add up on it all. Novella Heart of Darkness was released in 1902, while the movie version of Heart of Darkness dates back to 1993. The 91 years between the two can be a cause behind the seemingly different terrain. The Novella seems to have much harder conditions, and the film does not show Congo's prehistoric feel. Congo, in the film, just looks like another place, not the dark, inhumane place that the book paints this setting. I feel that this removes another important element that really contributes to the novella. <br /> <br /> With two of the biggest aspects of the story missing in the movie, the little bit of decency that is in the book Heart of Darkness is gone. When the controversy between light and dark is the biggest theme, not with the movie, it seems that the whole movie will be incredibly meaningless, and that is. It is boring, unexciting and a great waste of time. There is no need to see it. The book has been removed by any meaning it has. If necessary, for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and Credits Marlow: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich Russian: Morten Faldaas The intended: Phoebe Nicholls Directed by: Nicolas Roeg Written by Benedict Fitzgerald, based on novella by Joseph Conrad Playtime: 100 minutes PG 13 (little sexuality and language)
