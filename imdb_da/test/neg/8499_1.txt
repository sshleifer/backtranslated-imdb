I would not have given this film such a low rating (2) if the average had not been ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it to something more reasonable. I sat through most of this movie and looked at the scene after labeling and shoplifting. No dialogue, just tagging and shoplifting. Finally, they kissed the two taggers. Something happend. But then back to tagging and shoplifting. I left the screening. I only recommend this movie to those who are impressed by pretentious filmmaking. I did not like the director's previous film (a self-righteous defense of the man-boy's love), but at least the film had a story, interesting characters, dialogue. The graffiti artist only had stage after labeling and shoplifting. I want more from a movie than this.
