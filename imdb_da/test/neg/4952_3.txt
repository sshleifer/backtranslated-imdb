I do not understand why you would give this movie anything over 4 ... Fairly, it takes me back to the 80s and to the "good old days of horror comedy," but that genre hasn't been better since then - it's still so "LAME Low budget - low technology - bad acting - bad story line - not at all scary and not funny enough ... actually there is not very good I could say about it. The so-called monsters are just terribly bad! I think we are gone back in time when they used to make monsters out of plastic and shoot scenes fame for frame ... I really don't understand why anyone would invest money to make that script a movie - but I think it could have been almost OK if it had been a bigger budget film. <br /> <br /> Recommendation would be - please avoid wasting your time on this unless you want to get tips for a bad halloween make up! film and everything outside the box But it just didn't make me at least.
