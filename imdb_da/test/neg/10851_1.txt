Publicity for this movie suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses, so we're not shocked by the Duke of Mantua, who urinates during his rendering of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, and it's also not sensational to see Gilda singing Caro Nome in the bath. It's just crass and boring. What stands out about this movie is its lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk puts the duke's palace into a seedy swimming pool. In fact, he's not the Duke, he's just a sign by the name of Duka, so it's hard to see why he has lots of hangers and his own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a courtyard decorated with the orange sofa and decorated in the stained wallpaper that is right among the avant-garde directors. Duke is sorry Duka's heavier driving around on motor scooters (Yawn). <br /> <br /> Concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected and unintentional humor. What can we do with Gilda having a girl, even if she lives in a courtyard. When the call goes out, Monterone is taken to jail, we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two pink shorts executives. One imagines that he is being charged with urination in a public swimming pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera movies to be synced to lipstick 20 years ago, but there is just no excuse for it today. An opera named is like soft porn. You don't believe what happens because the artists don't make enough effort. The actor in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she has to sing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly separated. It is difficult to tell what opening the sound should be. The Duke, later praising this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with Maddalena, gives a new meaning to the term yodelling in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The sound of the sound never works properly when the orchestra sometimes pretends to be played through a transistor radio. It is pretty slow choosing rumpity-tumpity tempi, so the overall effect is karaoke in your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a movie of a production of Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They usually perform in a tent in a field. If I had seen this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland, I would have been quite indulgent. By filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also keep open for worldwide ridicule.
