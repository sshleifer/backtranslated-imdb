Not long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape entitled "Just Rambling Along" allegedly with Laurel and Hardy. Being a little familiar with their production and not recognizing this title, I made the disturbing decision to share with a whole dollar and buy it. After playing it, I identified the movie as HOP TO IT. Of course Mr. Laurel nowhere in the cast, which makes the packaging of this product criminally misleading. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like it was duped from an 8mm movie source. It had a somewhat appropriate musical score. In fact, it is still a tape if you just want an idea of ​​how the movie is. It is, in my opinion, a decent but unexpected card. IMDb must add straight RAMBLING ALONG as an alternative title to this movie, which, incidentally, was the name of a 1918 Stan Laurel movie!
