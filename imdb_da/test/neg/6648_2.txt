This is a movie that should have been a mini-series as it tries to get too much information in too little space. The whole story is constantly bombarded with part-plot, character entry and meaningless pieces of information that do not go anywhere. There is an underlying plot where the boy meets a girl, she is in doubt, but still gets married and saw her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real. They don't turn out to be, but her husband won't believe she wasn't unfaithful, and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her when she wasn't unfaithful to her husband. That being said, there are no less than 1000 part-plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. For the first 15 minutes you are flooded with so many things and situations that you just stop breaking. You don't care about any of the confused and twisted pieces that drift in and out of the story as vultures feeding on a corpse. Each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer. After half an hour, and completely uninterested, I remained and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. I couldn't imagine where it went, but like staring in a fire, I just couldn't get up and shut it down. The production values ​​are amazing, but the resulting film is a waste of time; Wash your socks instead.
