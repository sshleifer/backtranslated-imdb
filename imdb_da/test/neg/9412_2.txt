I went into this movie destined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc ... I went into this movie thinking I'd be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big Pacino fan. <br /> <br /> What a piece of garbage. Probably the worst movie I've seen in five years. This makes Pacinos debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half of the movie sees Matthew McConaughey lifting weights. OK, we get it. You're in shape Matt. We don't have to see all the other scenes with you pumping iron, shirtless. <br /> <br /> Second, how many plot holes are in this movie? Why introduce the phone call from Brandon's long lost father and never address it again? What was the meaning of her mother hanging on him - why does she even have the call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in NY and it is recognized illegally, how can they possibly guarantee everyone's efforts at the end? <br /> <br /> This was simply a very poorly written script. It had potential, but it was without a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his lesson on Any Given Sunday's script selection but didn't seem to. My Gosh, it's the same actor staring in the godfather! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
