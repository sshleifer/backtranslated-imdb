I can't believe I actually spent nearly three hours in my life seeing this. This should be one of the most incredible, predictable and cheesy TV movies I've seen for a long time. I was hoping for some good special effects and action, but instead I spent all the time rolling my eyes and shouting "OH COME !!!" on screen. The dialogue is low and obvious, the actor who is tense at times and as the story moves along, it is not just fun how everything happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and nauseating end ... Now I have seen more than my share of disaster movies, I'm actually a big fan and often think they can pull out quite unrealistic things as long as it's done in a fun way, but it's certainly not. This is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere. What did they think when they made this movie ?????
