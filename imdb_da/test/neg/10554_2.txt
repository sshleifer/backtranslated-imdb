Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It was probably no "Latter-day Saints." The movie profile in the middle ... maybe cut for about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable movie. But the film is again and again pushed by annoying subplots and throwing scenes - the whole gold fight comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was made for theatrical releases, it looks and sounds more like one made for TV movies. Each scene shines like a department store. So many characters are throwing away. <br /> <br /> And dear Tori is actually a pleasant surprise. She steals every scene she looks at. <br /> <br /> One scene really annoyed me. It was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with scores of tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where did everyone go. <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has sunk to a new low ... but not as low as the horrible movies are produced and shown on Here! Channel.
