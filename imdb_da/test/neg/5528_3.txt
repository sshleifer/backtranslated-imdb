... but memorable because it includes an actor I actually recognize! James Horan is familiar with these types of film standards, Lawrence Olivier. He's got some decent ideas about things like Highlander and various Star Treks, so it's fun if it's mildly depressing and sees him breaking down here. Okay, yes, there's a plot. Horan's character and his wife are fighting, he has an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to make his "masterpiece" movie, and their guest decides to enjoy the stake's underworld. But seeing Horan is really the only pleasure to be found here.
