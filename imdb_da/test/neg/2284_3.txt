It took only one view of this dog, for me to say "Never again!" It is so deeply unmemorable that I had to read others' reactions to it before I could remember anything beyond (1) it was terrible, (2) Connery should have stopped while he was ahead, and (3) out Bit that involves faking a retinal scan through the most cruel (not to mention horribly ineffective) means possible. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have never understood why anyone would prefer even the best of Connery's Bond movies to even worst Moore or Dalton excursions. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, for that matter. I personally found Octopussy and Moonraker, including "canonical" Bond movies, to be much more entertaining than this, and probably for the same reasons why others deprive the Moore Bond movies, namely their anger humor, and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the entire fundamental Bond environment.
