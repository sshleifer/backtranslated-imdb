This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Two-fisted tales" contain three foolish and childish episodes - genre is actually not horror or action, more like anything. Where's the suspension? Where's the fun? Where is common sense? Absolutely not here, but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a fierce, absurd western. I couldn't understand the whole idea of ​​it. "King of the Road" is a stupid story with starring Brad Pitt. At the time of "Two-fisted talks" he was just a beautiful face that really didn't know how to act yet. Fortunately, he learned the skill later, and now he is a fantastic, talented actor - one of the youngest in the younger generation. The story is almost ok, on the whole is stupidity. Final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost entirely successful. It's foolish, but fun. We must thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to see when sitting in an armchair and eating popcorn. (I should know that was what I did). If you loved "Tales from the Crypt", you'll love "Two-fisted talks" too, because it's basically the same. I understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare "works of art" and very hard to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS, but I don't think it's a big privilege. You have to be a fanatic Brad Pitt fan to find out. Otherwise, don't bother, it's not worth the effort. Silly crap.
