This film explores the now infamous Wannsee conference, where the best Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of "Final Solution". First I want to say that I was amazed to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With the licked back blonde hair he probably looked at that part, but he didn't work really well. There was none of the threat and cruelty, and finally he came out as a laughing cheerleader who kept the meeting going. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference break, as it did in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played Dr. William Stuckart, the man who wrote Nuremberg's racial law in 1935 and gave "legal respect" to everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was fantastic, the main vocal opponent of what Heydrich had suggested. The best part of all was when he verbally knocked down one of the Nazi thugs. Thug muttered "I remember you" and the Firth answer "you should! I'm very well known !!" The film is historically accurate, but let's boil it down to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting, and jumping. There is no tension, no real conflicts (except the short argument). It's only 90 minutes to speak! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. I for one felt short changed.
