I know many people like this show and I apologize for people who think this show is great, but it is the worst show ever created. I'm sure I'd be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn't on it. I think it's great to test cars and do things like seeing if a car can hit a plane. But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man. He thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has my best friend to say pathetic things. . He screams children just to take a picture of him. I'm sorry top gear, but Jeremy Clarkson is a freak.
