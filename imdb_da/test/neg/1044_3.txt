I saw this movie preview before anything else I rented a while back ... and it looked decent. I've seen some good things from Full Moon video and thought it was worth a shot ... Unfortunately, it wasn't good stuff. The story is about an obsessed bed. A couple move into a new apartment, discover the bed, and odd things begin to happen. Beautiful things that woman discovers kinky sex. And the man discovers kinky sex. And the woman draws pictures of kinky sex. And the man photographs kinky sex. And they both begin to have dreams of dead people who have kinky sex. You would think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good, right? <br /> <br /> Now .... No. The problem is that this has to be a scary movie, or at least a thriller, and it just doesn't deliver. There is little excitement, no tension and no fear. Apart from some disturbing dreams and visions, there really is nothing for this couple to be worried about. The whole movie is basically the two of those who have these visions and play around in bed. Well, you get a monster battle at the end ... and some bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular ... There's only one murder and a good scare and that's it. <br /> <br /> And kinky sex? Don't get your hopes up (or anything else for that matter). Their idea of ​​kinky sex is woman at the top, fully dressed, trying to choke his buddy with a tie. Not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
