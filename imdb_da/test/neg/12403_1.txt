This is one of those films where the play, the location, the direction and the effects were so bad that you have to rent a copy, get 5 or 6 friends, a keg beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, "Seeing this movie will be like having your brains smashed out of a piece of lemon ... wrapped around a big golden stone." What's wrong? Everything. British actors are like Americans, there have been many who can pull it out like Bob Hoskins, but he is not in this. It wasn't even necessary to choose North America as a place, why not say it took place in England or something? The director seemed to like taking shots of girls times and donkeys more than actually come up with some sort of motivation. So at this point you will drowning friends say "ALL RIGHT! Another T & A shot!". There is not much dialogue, so please feel free to jump into the kitchen and make these sandwiches. What did I like about this movie? After my friends left, I managed to collect $ 185 of them and told them that they were using it at the bar when we finished watching the horrible movie.
