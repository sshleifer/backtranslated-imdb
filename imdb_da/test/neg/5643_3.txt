I couldn't believe the original rating I found when I looked up this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it seems that I am not alone. The movie is slow and boring. One of the sad things is that if the film had a realistic rating of about 5 or 6, then the expectation would not have been so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so when I watch the movie and see the bad story and acting, I stand back and give it a 3/10 score. /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is great in Lock stock, and also Snatch, and he plays a big hard man, but he should stick to that role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger have made comedy films, they just don't work. <br /> <br /> He also can't play lead actor, he plays better as support or otherwise. When he plays lead, his acting talents are 'in the eyes' and shown up as not very good. Mean Machine is another good example of this.
