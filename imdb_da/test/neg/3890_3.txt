Before I begin, a "small" correction: IMDb says Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Wrong! I walked past him 10 years ago and he can't be an ants a ** bigger than 165. I'm 183 and he looked like a kid next to me. <br /> <br /> Should have been called "Wheatlands"; an appropriate title to complement Malick's former (and much better) movie "Badlands". This movie shows that not all directors have as their primary purpose to entertain. In fact, some of them have as their main goal to show wheat in all its glory. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressing and relatively uninvolved, with the mandatory tragic ending. Nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama, where the male two-thirds of the triangle does not survive the movie. Rust for its visual quality; While it has the realistic 70s feel to it, there are limits to how spell-binding wheat fields can be. You can shoot them with 1500 mm cameras for everything I care about, but they are still wheat fields. <br /> <br /> Doers who initially seem to be mistaken for a kind of lower class manufacturer-turned-Wheatfield worker are quite solid, while Brooke Adams seems distant and cool for most of the movie, which makes you wonder Be aware of how much she loved one of the two hunks. But for those looking for a movie showing all the white white fields, you no longer see: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" by Richard Gere and other Hollywood intellectual heavyweights, contact me by email.
