I guess two ways to make a movie with children as the intended audience. You can either say to yourself a) "Let's make a movie that kids will love today!" or b) "Let's make a movie that I would have loved when I was a child!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that appeal to a younger audience. Prime examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat, incredible characters that say things to be fun, but it's not. The plot itself is enough for a ten minute card, but instead it goes over and over again. And even if I'm not a kid, don't I really understand what this movie should be fun for kids? The clumsy cops hunted by a dog, the old lady with fifty birds or Christina Ricci sarcastic onlines? An actor showed talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug plays the FBI agent.
