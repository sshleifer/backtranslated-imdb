I thought it was an incredibly boring movie! I heard the director can't speak French and so he left his actors tell what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great as usual, but I can't say the same with other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all seem very tired, it is one of the movie plot: Tired of being together, living abroad, of their lives in general; so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while, I felt sleepy ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 because of some very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
