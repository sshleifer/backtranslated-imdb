The 1935 version of "Enchanted April" manages to be boring at the same time <br /> <br /> and perfunctory. It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor. The transformation of the four strangers flying from London is instantly cut from the first day to a week later. Instead of developing, the manuscript switches and <br /> <br /> the characters are different. The spouses are dull enough in flashbacks without turning up, although their presence does not drive four women back in their shells and / or hostilities. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph has the most fun (moving instead of completely chewing on <br /> <br /> stage) and Katharine Alexander has some sharp charm out of her <br /> < br /> man's shadow (and away from his hideous drone). Ann Harding is <br /> <br /> unremarkable here (with the production code enforced). She had a <br /> <br /> appropriate line in a previous movie ("Pre-Code"), "When Ladies Meet": "You're not worth a moment of anxious hour either one of us has given You, "but in" Enchanted April "can only look evil, accelerate and proclaim fealty to his bad man.
