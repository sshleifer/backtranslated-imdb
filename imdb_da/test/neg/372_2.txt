I made it about 8 minutes into "Steel Frontier" before I knocked it off. Then I cling to punishment as I am, I saw a little more the next day. Today I had to iron a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the movie and that was his own punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $ 7,000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies. But here we have two directors with no doubt more money, and they churn out a huge, steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: "It is 'Road Warrior', but it is like a future western. We get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we have my mentally challenged cousin, write the script, and We'll use the budget on a bunch of explosions. We can't lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I don't even think the MST3K boys could improve this. But if you insist on seeing it, I recommend getting very full first.
