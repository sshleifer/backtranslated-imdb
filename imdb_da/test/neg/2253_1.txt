Former Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It's not Inglorious, its obnoxious. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The whole point of a movie is to entertain - if you call bashing people's heads and remove their scalps entertaining !!!! - And if there is an unforgivable sin that a movie can commit, it's extreme boredom or disgust. <br /> <br /> The movie is just a collection of endless and tirelessly boring and obnoxious scenes of people talking at tables in different languages. There is even a scene where 3 people speak for almost 45 minutes at the same table, before fortunately they are all shot. I wanted them to have been turned off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to close up F ** K. <br /> <br /> This table style is a Tarantino stamp, but in other movies I actually used to have what they said and the people who spoke. Here I couldn't fit less. All Quentin's films show tremendous confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here's a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he went with the movie. Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'll have to remind me. Fortunately, the film was so thin I couldn't even remember seeing it earlier the day before, until I saw an MSNBC review. <br /> <br /> He is out of gimmicks and seems to die for writing a novel. But do us a service QT and save us the movie. <br /> <br /> I went out of this movie halfway through and I will never recommend anyone to watch it, no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10.
