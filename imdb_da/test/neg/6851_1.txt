For a lost soldier, for a lost soldier, is a boring example of how not to translate to film a touching, complex psychological examination of the most magical time in a human's life when he is still a child, but begins to become a man. The novel records the real life experiences of Rudy van Dantts as said through the boy Jeroen during the declining days of World War II at age 11, as he deals with his infantile sexuality and his deep fear of task which he has been sent to the province by Friesland, north of Holland by his parents because of the lack of food in Amsterdam and has not heard from them for many months as the postal service has broken down. The arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is presented painfully corny, with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style. Then a soldier, Walt, romances Jeroen and the couple are presented as two frolicking men. Who completes their love in a sexual experience. This was taken by the 11 yo Jeroen. The reality was something different: Jeroen describes his meetings with Walt, 6 in total, in detail, but in oblique language. But there is no misunderstanding of their nature. Walt is awakened to an intense passion of Jeroen, where he handles him roughly, so in their last meeting Jeroen is broken and suffers a painful wound on his shoulder, where Walt has bitten him. During this meeting, Walt Jeroen regrets twice. Jeroen could easily have avoided Walt after their 2nd meeting when Walt first attacks him, as Walt is clearly eager to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers. Why Jeroen continues to seek out Walt is a mystery to the human heart and not explanatory to me anyway. What the film leaves is the aftermath: the nightmares, the rejection, the terrible search in Amsterdam on the chance to find Walt, for Jeroen loved Walt, and nothing could shake it.
