Why I did not like the movie, except for the actors' self-indulgence, is that someone might actually believe in something like that. <br /> <br /> First of all, Christ's second will come at the end of the words, and when Jesus Christ comes on judgment day, he will not come as he did before in human form. He will come to his full glory as God, and we must be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone wants! Second, I have seen the eternal gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all undoubtedly "I read the Bible last night and it is not written everywhere". Well, that's it. Moses mentions on 3 different occasions that men who love other men or women who love each other as if husband and wife are to be killed because they will never inherit the kingdom of God as they are evil! If it were really for us to follow the Bible word by word, there would be executions now, wouldn't it? But I think misinforming people do more harm than it would ... It was in the Old Testament. There are lots of lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are God's Son, but making a movie after that really makes you think about how many idiots out there can make a movie.
