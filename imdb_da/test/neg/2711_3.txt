********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ********** Madonna plays an ex-con to restore some valuable information that can remove her from the murder that she was imprisoned in four years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax lawyer who married her chief daughter. Together, the two must come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus ... When you get down to it, it's a stupid movie. Without attempting to give away the plot **** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****, they try to protect the film's evil by protecting the boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder sent to Madonna. What kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! <br /> <br /> Then there are the police who are subsequently Madonna following the evil in a limo where they have the brides-girls all bound! And let's not forget the same brides-maids who fought from the front door of the front door, who are still tied together! And I hate to say this, but the patagonian cats probably look like a cougar! There can only be four of them in the New York City area so they can be threatened there, but I know there are plenty of them in the Rocky Mountains (see "Charlie The Lonesome Cougar" if you really want to see a big one "cat" in the movie). And let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet ... NOW! <br /> <br /> The reason is there, but that's all there is to this movie. I was hardly out of my teens when this movie was originally released and I was a bit of a Madonna fan, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then she has fallen out of popularity with me and I have confronted the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing, she has that singing career to fall back on). It may be considered a "5" since then, but it has fallen to "hardly make a 2" over the years.
