That was what I and my friends kept asking each other throughout this flick. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think someone shot this on their video camera at home and turned it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone would ever pick it up. Well, I suppose the joke is on us. I think I should have come to this site first and read all the reviews it has received, every one says that this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and by and by. And boy are they right! Although it gave some pretty good laughs (I and my friends were pretty full) because it is so stupid. We just can't believe anyone was stupid enough to make such a crazy movie! I swear that it should be done in the 70s before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene really looks crazy, but when I looked at it, it said it was made in 2001? What? It doesn't look like a movie that would be made today, but I think that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using the strokes and really fake lasers and use real people from your hometown instead by actors or even hopeful actors. BTW- some of these chickens (or where they draw queens, we couldn't tell!) Were so fugly, even my drunk cowboy college comrades would not touch them with a 50 foot pole. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no appeal for this movie at all, bad acting, bad writing, poor management, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your time or money on this, you'll be totally disappointed!
