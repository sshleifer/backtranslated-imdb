A boring stroll through Mormon's prostate healing. Absolutely un-funny. A testament to the widely held theory that in order for bathroom humor to be fun, it must necessarily be vulgar; It also supports the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you fun. More propaganda than movies, don't worry about any touch social issues that come up on the dining table after that. The sparse grace of this movie is its exact depiction of young Mormon females as particularly attractive. Oh yes it's your $ 7.50.
