Do you think you've seen the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who designed the cover of this box should be charged with false advertising. The deck makes it look like a good, scary horror suspense thriller. But no. What we have instead is NIGHTSCREAM. A movie that makes a "sweeeoooowww !!" noise every time a credit blinks across the screen. The biggest name in the whole movie is probably Casper Van Dien, who hardly has a role. <br /> <br /> I voted only one for this because I couldn't vote any lower. If I could vote something like a negative five thousand, believe me, I would have. So for now I will give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it ended.
