Very boring show. What's worse, it's very racist. The white guys are stupid idiots, and the only romance is between a black guy and a white woman. There is nothing interesting about this romance, it is not exciting, it is not fun, they do not even seem to care about each other, it is more like the authors and the directors wanted an interracial thing going on. Why is this so popular in the media today? It is social programming and will lead to not good, there are always tensions when too many people want the same. This show is not worth 20 bucks for the season, it's a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use TV shows to sell products, they are more discreet, and it is quite obvious to sell what the agenda is here, and without clear thinking, some may feel like opposing it, but some of them know us better.
