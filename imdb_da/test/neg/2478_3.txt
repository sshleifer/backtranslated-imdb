1) If you want to make a movie dealing with social realism, it is imperative that the audience identify with the characters being portrayed. 2) The audience cannot identify with characters that are strongly stereotyped or with situations that are obvious. 3) If you have a bad actor then you can't build any character. Yet, even if you have good actors, their work will be ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jes√∫s Ponce ignores the 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes out of place. His script is so predictable: a woman comes out of prison, she meets her old junkie girlfriend, life is hard, etc. Whatever the story is all, but the original wouldn't be that bad if only Ponce wasn't a complete one incompetent writing and filming. I wonder how long they will keep money from our treasures to make movies like this. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
