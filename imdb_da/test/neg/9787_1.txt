I'm shocked to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this "movie". This film has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the play is pathetic, I have a hard time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie, let alone sing their "praise". The idea is horrible, some scenes attached to the plot (like the continued love story, though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I would hurt myself while I saw them. The fact that there is a scene where a shrunk head flies under a girl's shirt so that he can "feel her up" and she likes it to be reason enough for anyone associated with this movie to be lost . The connection to West Side Story can only be a shame in referring such a great movie in such a terrible one is the reasons alone to destroy all copies of this movie. To make a long story short, this movie is horrible in every way. And if I had my way, everyone who likes it should go straight to hell ...
