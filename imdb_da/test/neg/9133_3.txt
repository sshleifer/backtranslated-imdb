Koyaanisqatsi's peace and beauty was a strong confirmation of the natural world. In Naqoyqatsi, we are attacked by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent and the digital - the devastating constructions of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms have been taken with the pictures with poster, disturbing, and very slow movement. The compounds between the sequences are invisible if any. Naqoyqatsi is defined in the film's end, an unanswered opportunity to place the images in the context. <br /> <br /> The movie is hard to see, the quality of the archive films is uneven, and it's the most redeeming qualities are its theme and Philip Glass's hypnotic score.
