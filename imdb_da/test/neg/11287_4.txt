I don't know about the real Cobb, but I got the clear impression that the aim of the filmmakers was to try to soften his sharp edges and reputation, not giving us a true portrait of the man himself. In the film, in addition to a few racist remarks, he shows that he is just another hard-nosed, cantakerous old coot (he's so full of life!) With a heart of gold (more or less). This is also the worst I have seen T.L.Jones do (he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotypical character). He just doesn't waste Cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie. Not for a minute I forgot that it was Tommy Lee Jones on the screen pretending to be Ty Cobb. Robert Wuhl didn't impress either. The "comic" elements of this movie were just distracting and didn't really ring at all. A bloody waste of time it is
