... with a $ 500 budget and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of C movies with no talented players at all, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera work, this movie is delivering. <br /> <br /> All others are warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is good for some laughs though. See it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie. <br/> <br /> 2/10 for accidental comedy. Why the hell are you going to write 10 lines? I've seen comments with smaller lines, and writing is just a lame filler.
