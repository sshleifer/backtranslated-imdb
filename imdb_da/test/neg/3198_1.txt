Anyone who thinks this movie is fantastic has a desperate need for their head. It strikes me that this movie was made as a joke. It has no good points at all. The props cost about $ 10, and the whole set looks as if it could fall down at any time. Why are movies like this done in the first place? This also had two of the most annoying signs I have ever encountered in the young boy on the space ship and the 20th century redneck. This movie is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice" with the incredible talented Vanilla "misunderstood" Ice.
