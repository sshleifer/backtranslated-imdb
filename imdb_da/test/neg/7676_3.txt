The real star from the last of the airport's films is the great supersonic airline that the French created called The Concorde. If you keep in mind that the whole movie is dedicated to showing what the needled planet could do in the sky than the whole movie's kind makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you're expecting some serious drama here, then, in general, some of the elusive acts that Concorde is showing here take when some unpleasant people are trying to shoot her down. Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the military proprietor industrial tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's helpers is just bringing her information about some of Wagner's dirty business relationships and selling weapons to people who are not friendly to the United States. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of her, and she is almost done with a man who escapes, of course, she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course he denies it. But just before Blakely boards Concorde, McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire gets her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his minions are trying to put the big bird down. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy are up to all their tricks. It is quite a bag full that you will see if you want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation interested, you will definitely not be interested in the plot. It's like the movie Le Mans with Steve McQueen, who has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult object. Maybe Le Mans is better at it because they just didn't disturb any kind of story. Among the passengers is a pot smoker saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a distraught mother accompanying a new heart to her child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the loo. She is actually the best one here. <br /> <br /> Robert Wagner must have been psychic, but because he is sure to strengthen the movie, he was part of Doctor Evil's second in the Austin Powers series. /> <br /> I'm sure everyone interested got a big payday out of this movie, but it seems to have killed the Airport saga of movies.
