I watched this movie recently and I said to myself, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor, but he is no director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that the play is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very bad story called a plot! What I really thought was bad was the beginning when Kirk and McCoy taught Spock to sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" Do I have anything against William Shatner? I do not. But when it comes to being an instructor, he sucks! This movie is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But it's the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after this, Shatner did not return to lead another movie in the series. They didn't seem to want him to lead another movie again after this! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
