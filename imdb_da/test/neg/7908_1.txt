I hate to comment on something I didn't finish, but if I save a person what I spent nearly an hour before I disgusted it, it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to see this with an open mind knowing it was at the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually love raw humor or at least tolerate it. I love so-called "black" comedies. Nor am I easily offended. <br /> <br /> It started okay and quickly went downhill. I laughed a couple of times (for example, when the protagonist got stuck in the plane toilet), but it was and did not compensate for the strong disgust I felt. <br /> <br /> I didn't laugh when the dog was sucked into a jet engine. I can't usually see humor in animals that die (except in Animal House). I didn't laugh much about nastiness either. I knocked it off after an incident with a blind man and a baked potato, which I do not care to repeat the details, only that the wave of nausea still has not passed me. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it was filthy and simply not fun with hardly any plot. This is one of the times when you have nothing good to say, get the word out. <br /> <br /> Don't say I don't warn you.
