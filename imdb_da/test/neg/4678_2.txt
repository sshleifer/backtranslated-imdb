The name of Bad Company's largest hit album is called "10 From 6". You might have just turned up this album and cut the sound of this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I suppose older people in the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made in the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel about movies made in the 1970s. The characters in the movie looked as if they were auditioning for Danny Terrio. Why is it that movies have to overdo the 1970s. The only good time I liked was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut that TV show. It was exactly what things were in high school when I was back there around 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70's and no small town was like that. It was quite youth dominated. There were no reactionaries talking about the Hippies and about Inner City Philly. It was more like the 70s that I remember as a child. This movie was very boring and cheesy. At times I slept in sleep. I don't know why an actor who appeared in the 70s appeared in this. He probably tried to give it some credibility. Walken did not even appear before the second half. I suppose the only true thing about the movie was "baby boomers" was / is a spoiled mass. All the kids in the movie were spoiled brats. I do not know what they had against their father.
