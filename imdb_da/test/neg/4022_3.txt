What was this, a Zucker brothers movie? I don't mind a little humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "The Private Life of SH"), but this version of "The Sign of Four" feels like a Grand-Guignol-esque episode of "Murder , she wrote "(right from the opening credits, which are of the worst kind: a montage of scenes from the movie) as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a fine actor and certainly looks to the part (he is a dead call to the drawings from The Strand!) But his interpretation of the character is all wrong and far too humorous, from the silly smile he often jumps (I thought fabric Holmes was in was cocaine, not weed) to his expression of comic stiffness in the carnival sequences. Not to mention that when he pamperes himself as an old man, he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we are immediately recognized by him. David Healy is an unmemorable, but considering the circumstances, acceptable Watson, and is not too much of a buffoon ... at least not more than the other characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated fashion, right out of a 1930's vaudeville. <br /> <br /> Historically, there are some pointless additions (like giving Tonga vampire teeth, an appetite for raw meat, and a carnival grain as a place to live, which makes him a rejection from the island of Dr. Moreau), and We even refuse to discover the mystery with Holmes, as we are well informed about everything Holmes finds out. And it's filled with tired clich√©s: Not only do we get the infamous catch phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" (as Sherlockian wants to know Conan Doyle never wrote), but we are exposed to such blatant commonplaces as having Hindi music pop out of nothing when Holmes goes to see a white guy in Hindi clothes. Bottom Line: In the UK in the 80s, two rival television companies attempted to create a large number of series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and produced preliminary television films as potential pilots. One of them starred Ian Richardson, the second star Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one who came through several episodes was the good one! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Parody.
