CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) starring: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle . <br /> <br /> Plot: A group of cheerleaders along with their coach and three guys are on their way to a game when suddenly their van breaks down and they take refuge in a nearby cabin. Soon they drink, have sex and are brutally murdered one by one by an invisible killer. The Good: A few laughs, surprising identity of the killer, a Brinke Stevens cameo, my favorite scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE used as feedback. <br /> <br /> The Bad: I was thrilled with this movie, I loved all three Slumber Party Massacre because they were just so funny, and I was expecting much of this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with Crying Tones", but it just sucked in. They overstated it on "We are cheesy but proud" stuff and made basic soft-core porn, but with a good who-it-it. <br /> <br /> **
