Now I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but I can't believe Shane Black wrote this pile ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I screened it for a film festival. Terrible. All laughed. It's preaching and heavy-handed ... not to mention stupid. It is also surprising how little L.A. looks like Cambodia. The whole idea of ​​time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is a little stupid. Imagine "Born Fourth of July" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I used to continue as the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by Michael Bay's 2nd Unit Director. So bad. The 2 stars are based solely on the production value.
