Every time I pass this show on TV, I will absolutely scratch my eyes and tear my ears off. It's so incredibly terrible. The jokes are not fun, the play is terrible and the whole show is a big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's gut, and I just want to hit her face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talk. She is no talent, low IQ, great waste on society, and I think she would benefit the world if she just closed up f * ck and walked away for a long time. I say it with all my heart. DO NOT SEE AN EPISODE OF THIS SHOW !!!!!! It's not even worth 30 minutes in your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself than seeing this show for half an hour.
