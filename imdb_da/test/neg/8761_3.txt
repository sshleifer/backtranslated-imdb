<br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Travel in Bayou, Larry Adams, (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington (Mauritz Hugo) are informed that a friend is deceased. Met with local Dr. Von Altermann, (John Carradine), he repeats the notion that they died mysteriously. While staying there, they realize that the help consists of zombies, revived dead people making their masters bid. When the bodies jump up, he reveals that he has made the creatures for use in various trials, and everyone tries to stop him before it is too late. <br /> <br /> The good news: This gets very little right. The opening is easy, it's best, as it has several good grades for it. From where it begins, with the creepy silhouettes going in the dark all the way to the revelations, this wonders works for both the mysterious and the beautiful image. The big one is a real scene where the creature comes out of a coffin in a long, slow and eerie shot. These are all ready before the opening credit and are a fun sight. The scenes in the middle, where the creature reawakens inside the coffin, are pretty chilling and look really good. The last big positive is the really fun end. With the kind of end that feels reminiscent of so many universal trials, this fits into that style. From the eerie revival to the real action involved near the swamp, this fun is working really with the others to give the only real positive. The bad news: This one has only a few mistakes, but they are big. The first is the movie's great boredom from inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, primarily because of the tendency to do everything with speaking rather than anything else. There are only intermittent scenes referred to the zombies, but there is nothing here that uses any action for the movie. This simply has no action, and that is what hurts the movie. It rarely generates scenes that keep the interest going, and it often does so much longer than it really is. The last mistake in the movie is the pathetic excuses for zombies. Those used for more modern fares have difficulty getting any fears for these creatures, and they only serve multiple scenes. This does not treat the zombies as threats, making them even less intimidating. A little screen time, unfortunate nature, and untimely behavior from these zombies really destroys this. These are what really hurts the movie. The Final Judgment: With bad zombies and almost nothing worth seeing, this one is a curious effort. Those accustomed to modern zombies will find little interest in this one and come out the same as this one, while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot.
