. . . and never see it. Now I've been watching bad scifi movies for years. I love to see bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason I could see this movie all the way through. I was ravaged by "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and the horrible "Fantastic Four" movie just to name a few. Normally I have to hit my head against the wall after I have seen a bad movie to get some of the pain going away. No, not with this one. With "TDB" I had to hit my head with a shoe in the middle of the film. Temporary correction. I can't believe I would see it. I cried. When it was finished I cried. It was awful. It was worse than when I saw * shudder * Wil Wheaton in his underwear in "The Curse" which by the way never looks either. Apart from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his tighty whiteys, it's just sooo bad. But this review is about "TDB." The worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said, "This deserves to go to movies! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "Oh, that's what I want on my movie story!" I want to see "Indian Superman" until the cows come home, but I will never see this steaming pile of dren again.
