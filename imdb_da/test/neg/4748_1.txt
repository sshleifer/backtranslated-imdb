With this movie I really hoped that the idea was to compensate for the first AVP's tenacity, and yet to my horror: Requiem is far worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes were up in the opening hours of the movie inside the Predator ship, and I almost reached a relief sigh as we finally saw the world of Predator home (a smooth digital painting but still nice to finally see it) and then of course, Humans (if such badly written characters can be described as such) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> One must wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie out of Aliens and Predators. At least, the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework. The characters were created the same way we would expect from the worst Friday of the 13th Sequel. The pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was any other scene of character interaction that followed it. Bimbos and teenagers not actors do not make a real movie, they make it a cheap flick, and Alien 1-3 and Predator movies were good because they were produced over the concept (remember that 1st Alien is a "B" movie made as an "A" movie Strause brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been remedied by just knowing their Alien + Predator roots: In both Alien and Predator movies we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group ( Alien: Refineries, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts and in the Predator movies, we generally follow a major part of a device: Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police), and it's easy to see where movie makers from both franchises started to go wrong: in Alien Resurrection we have pirates ... or something, AVP do we ... explorers? ... with weapons ?? And of course in the AVP-R we have teen slasher clichés. What is there to identify with here? In the concept, the idea of ​​a prison returning to a small town and a war shepherd seemed to set up a first-aid hero, but like many things it was never paid. <br /> <br /> The Film production is also devoid of reasonableness. There is no sense of propulsion in the action, just small sequences that build the most minimal levels of excitement or interest, only to cut away just as they become interesting ... to take the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action scenes themselves, even though they are very ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit, it is literally impossible to tell what happens during battle scenes when they finally emerge. Basically, the film is prevented from many levels. Bad actors combined with poor direction and a frightening manuscript (as a writer I have noticed myself seemed to hit any wrong note and cliché that only the most outspoken author without ideas could have hadhed together) WRITING, if it can be called, is not even directly to video quality, nor does it show a sharpness of respect for the established lore of the earlier entries in the series. Why does Predalia suddenly have the ability to shoot alien embryos into a pregnant woman's neck to use her as an incubator for chestbursts? More than likely because the brain-dead screenwriter needed a way to get more foreigners to fight the predator (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as soon as possible. Why do meaningless little talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks ( does the supposed sign replace true character development? (Remember, a character is defined by what they do, not say.) Why is the sheriff the leading civilian to a cache of weapons? (Isn't he the law officer?) How does bimbo know All People Where They Are Why Wait for Predator on Predator to Remove Very Slowly His Mask Before It Attacks Why are Foreigners Still Falling in the Creepy Serial-Post-Alien 3 Habit to Beat All the Time to Let Their Prayer Know how on earth has this series referred to a sign saying "People are dying ... we need weapons!" (how this author even works, is past me and reflects poorly on To Fox is already destroyed artistic reputation. It is like everyone who is involved in the production of this movie has some mental impairment or is really unfortunate at all levels of the film making process. <br /> <br /> The effects are pretty miserable this time. Foreigners look like men in suits and ADI just gets lazy with their being design. Foreigners look like modified remnants of Alien Resurrection, with the same bulky muscles around their arms as if they did not learn from the film that it was not a good design, nor a good one to recycle. Again, everything is encased in such a dark state that one does not create mystery or atmosphere, but merely hide how bad the creatures look. And like in AVP, Stan Winston is very much missed when the fake-looking Predator face is revealed. There are too many mistakes to list so I just want to say this: Don't waste your money on this movie. Fox is in addition to worrying about the fans, as this cheap and winding movie is clearly a sign. I felt bad having taken my boyfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her profusely. This is a deadly fan that has finished the franchise. Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not a mindless slasher flick, it was a movie adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook that was better than anything you produced for this franchise post 1993. <br /> <br /> Signing off.
