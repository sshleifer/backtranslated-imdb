I do not know how this film received so many positive comments. You can call it "artistic" and "beautifully busy", but these things don't make up for the empty plot filled with sexual innuendos. I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching this movie. Instead of being biographical, it was a bad excuse to promote strange and eerie behavior. It was just another Hollywood attempt to convince us that this kind of life is normal and okay. From the beginning, I asked myself what was the meaning of this movie, and I continued to see, hoping it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money watching this in a theater!
