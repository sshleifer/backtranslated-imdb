The Shirley Temple films for Twentieth Century Fox are not insignificant because they are poorly crafted (Darryl F. Zanuck watched most of them). They do not retain much of a "classic" stature among the cinema's aficionados, mainly because they are balanced with the syrupy optimism of the Depression era Hollywood. The 1930s the audience became stunned by the joy of seeing a faint, often orphaned sunshine girl, making the adults look foolish in comparison (they fret and angry their hands as she danced her problems away). Seen these many years later, temple vehicles hardly come to history (always helped by musical sequences to strengthen the content), and her timing (always too perfect) and exaggerated reactions can leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes. No one can possibly be due to their amazement at temple performance here (shouting lines at the top of her lungs) or perverseness of his dance steps, sashaying with a crowd of sailors to "At Codfish Ball". However, the fantasy aspect of this particular story, previously filmed in 1924 from the book by Laura E. Richard, is enough to capture them in the correct saccharin spirit. Seems Shirl was pulled from a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse officer, but when a threatening government officer finds out that the dick is not in school, she threatens to take the child away. It doesn't matter if the modest officer has a point that the temple is not being erected properly (the woman is transformed into the ruthless villain almost immediately); one can immediately see that the temple can keep itself, take care of itself and her older guardian (as well as the local widow who has her hooks to the captain). The temple is not the only one that is excessively repetitive; Guy Kibbees January is cued for far-reaching reactions so you often wonder if he didn't film them all in one day. The dialogue is steeped in the ocean's metaphors ("You can't hurry trout!" ... "Well, don't give up the ship!) And something about the whole business seems weirdly pixelated. ** from *** *
