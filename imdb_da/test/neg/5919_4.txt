I am a collector of movies starring Mrs Weaver, so I only purchased this because she was in it. I find it really strange that her early career is filled with so many horrible movies. She started with an incredible promise in Alien, but then had a lot of bombs. These bombs include this movie, century-old, a woman or two and half moon street. She also appeared in the Year of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than remarkable. In the time between Alien and it's 1986 successor, Aliens, the only movie she did was worth something was Ghostbusters. Before the release of foreigners, I am sure everyone thought that this woman was coming out. Luckily she wasn't. <br /> <br /> Back to eyewitnesses, the movie is boring. It doesn't create any excitement. William Hurt seems like a cardboard is set and the atmosphere is just drying. Sigourney is decent, but nothing worth remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you need to, but don't go in for a decent movie. See better movies with these two stars as Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
