Big Fat Slob 'Uncle Buck', played by John (eats-a-lot-of) Candy, visits the sane members of his family for a week to baby-his two sweet children (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and a beautiful but sneaky teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). Shenanigans begins when Buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his blimp of a body. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring but peppered with two or three fun scenes, including Buck trying to get a word on the edge of the phone with his angry boyfriend (Amy Madigan) and his encounter with a very disgusting clown. <br /> <br /> Candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds.
