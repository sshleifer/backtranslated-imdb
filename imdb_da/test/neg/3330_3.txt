A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently reopened after an earthquake. Of course, they are not aware of the local legend that there is something down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a little cult following, and I'm not quite sure why (unless it's because it's so unclear). I admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour that comes there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular peculiarity does not appear until 45 minutes. Even in the extras, co-author Chris Huntley admits that it commits the unforgivable sin to be boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from the USC so I would hope they know that an exploitation movie should be useful. Yet, as I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors are fighting the stop environment and there is a cool John Carpenter-like score. I'd like to see more of the monster, but it's literally on the screen for 45 seconds. Although the film is not the best, Code Red DVD has given much attention. You have interviews and an audio comment from director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-author Huntley. The stories about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring (as a cave set is built on a backyard). Even more interesting is Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the production feature. Huntley was a rather talented artist, and it is a pity that he did not do anything else. Sawicki has been working steadily in Hollywood as a visual effect and camera guy. The movie's VHS is a bit legendary for how dark it was, and I'm sure this is much better. But you still get scenes where the only picture is five helmet lights that jump around in the variety. Sure to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "horror movie set in a mine" champ.
