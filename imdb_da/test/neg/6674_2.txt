Okay, so maybe the play wasn't bad, but I'm writing this review as a public service to prevent others who happen at the thrilling beginning of this telephony throwing away two hours in their lives and waiting for some plot developments that will never come. The main researcher has a gut that feels who went away with the missing marine officer (Guy) and few people who are not involved spectators and the prosecutor seem to dispute her. So what is the purpose of living with this drama? Turns the heel out of me. I continued to think (or hope) there would be some kind of plot twist or new revelation, but no one was coming. In summary, I cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless television movie from a true story or not.
