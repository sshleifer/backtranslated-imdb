Please ... if anyone gets the chance to read this, BEFORE you see the movie if it can be called so, refrain from it ... don't waste your time !!!! I also watched this movie right after completing the book and was seriously disappointed ... the protagonist is basically a new made Fanny, because she doesn't show any resemblance to the book ... she's so lively and laughing all the time ... if there was one thing the author wanted to put on this was that she was a very shy, introvert character .... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story that are supposed to convey to the violent end are simply not taken into account ... and the rest made up !!! I think it's better to spend time either reading a little bit of the actual novel or just not doing anything.
