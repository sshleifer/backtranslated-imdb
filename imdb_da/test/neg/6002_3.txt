Predictable, gory, over-gimmicky, mediocre. Don't waste your time - there are many much better movies out there. <br /> <br /> The resurrection starts OK, but the plot is quickly repeated. My level of interest fell steadily. At the end of the movie I was just glad it was finally over. The characters are never fully developed. The kinematics is muddy and the rapid change of POV rotations - but impressive in 1999, may only currently serve to label the film as an attempt to replace the gage whiz-flash to plot and signage. The movie movie grids serve some purpose (convey excitement and anxiety), but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive. A shame overall - the film / story had of course potential, and the producers / directors and the actors of course have technical expertise. A disappointment.
