Waste is just that, a waste of time. MTV runs out made for television movies on a quite rock today. One of my friends recommended this and I rented it, it was unnecessary to say that I will not pursue any further inquiries from her anytime soon. This movie shows the slide of drug use. The problem is, you really don't care about any of the signs because of the lack of believabilty and their own self-discipline. This movie is in a word, annoying to see, from the horrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing. The "digital" format tries for realism, but comes up for distracting. If you want a genuine drug use area, see Requiem for a Dream.
