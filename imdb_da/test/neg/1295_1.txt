Avoid this movie. If you expect "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you can only experience something more than a case of "bends". This movie offers nothing more than two extremely long and drawn-out hours of complete boredom. The cast members act as if they are angry at the irritation of a bath of water that overflows a bed of negligible petunias. The scripture is completely unrealistic, and the film does not even have the feeling of a disaster film. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, except for Tom Courtenay. It is unfortunate that such a fine actor was swept away with a flood of misrepresentation to arrive at such leaching. When this film was made, Poseidon must have turned, in his watery grave, into a sea of ​​shame. And Shelley Winters will resurrect, from the dead (directly from Poseidon), to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie. I rate this movie a 1 out of 10, but it really deserves a zero. This movie will make you want to avoid, or completely turn to, water. And it will leave a bad taste in the mouth. It can even make you want to see "Jaws" (1975) and be kind to a big white.
