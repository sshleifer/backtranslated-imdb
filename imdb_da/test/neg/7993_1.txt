I stumbled upon this movie late at night on television. My brother and I couldn't stop laughing at how God horrible this movie is. They crazy sound effects when white ninja or black ninja blows, kicks or uses a weapon is fun. This movie is almost the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because of the crappiness shift. I'm not sure if the director meant it was so crazy for that purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it.
