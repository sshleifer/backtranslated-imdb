I thought the sleeping cell was interesting and exciting to watch until the last episode, when nothing happens, it's F ****** BS, you Americans portray Muslims as terrorists, and the Americans as the hero is the reverse , I hate it when all American TV shows end up predicting, I hoped the bombs would go out into that stadium, but I knew it wouldn't take pleasure to see it when you know they good people go to save the day, once again, Americans are the biggest terrorists, g bush the leader of them all, he is blamed for 9/11, and i am P ***** that you keep throwing these shows with us, which are all f ****** same! I have a good show on terrorism, it's called "The Whitehorse" and the bush itself cell leader, the same with 24, where ever 24 was good, sleeping cell is a mock and should never make a season 2, its F * **** joke! And you are also American producers.
