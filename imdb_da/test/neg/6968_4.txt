I recently watched Ed Wood Jr.'s autobiographical film Glen or Glenda for the first time after hearing so much about it for so many years. Nothing I had read or heard about this movie could prepare me for what I saw. This must be the most bizarre movie ever made. Stamping buffalo, women in slavery, Satan prancing around and Bela Lugosi, rambling only as he can, "Preserve, Preserve .... pull the string, pull the string ...", it was completely insane. The action was terrible and the dialogue was unintentionally hilarious, exactly what one would expect from an Ed Wood movie. Having said all that, as horrible as this movie was, I have to give Wood credit ... he was way ahead of his time. You should remember that when this movie was made, transvestites were not even publicly discussed, much less the subject of a movie. I've read that Wood was a real life transvestite, and I'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. It was sad to see Bela Lugosi say the ridiculous lines he had to say to this movie, but it was a kind of Ed Wood Jr. to at least give Mr Lugosi a play at a time in the life of Bela when he was effortless and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him. If you've never seen this movie then watch it, especially if you're a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
