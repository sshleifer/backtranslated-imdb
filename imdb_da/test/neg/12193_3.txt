What could have been an excellent hostage movie was completely ruined by what apparently looks like a bored instructor ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash party was not one of those !!! The last 45 minutes. Or that results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ... and sex machine ?? ... You make fun of me! The actors such as Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this rambling movie. <br /> <br /> The director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks, including el mariachi, desperado, once in Mexico and the very recent sin city ... really keeps you in mind of well done first half. .. which makes you think you are in an entertaining time ... but apparently for no reason and without provocation, the madness starts ... there are even weak attempts at parody and comedy. .. really exasperating !!
