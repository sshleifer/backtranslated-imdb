Have I seen a worse movie? No, I can't say I have. This was pathetic. If the director still lives: 1. He should not be. 2. He was ashamed. 3. God, how would I like to take my 2 totally wasted hours on his $$. <br /> <br /> To give you a few pointers of "movies": <br /> 1. (I'm a man) and I'd rather give me a paper cup on the opening of urethra before I see it again (seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. It has a few well-known names in it (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help, and their cinema career after this "movie" is officially by the way. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue is the worst I have ever heard. "I want to ejaculate on your bozonkas." What kind of writer did they have on this movie? Did he still use hooked-on-phonics and just get his letters mixed up to make those horrible phrases? Or did he try to get the director beaten by the few people who saw this? <br /> <br /> 4. Watch this "movie" backwards. Because I reward you for not looking forward. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" would get Helen Keller up and leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The set of the movie looks like an adult sized McDonald's playground. I was just waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the ball group at some point in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. I also like it in the year 3000, they still have headsets with wires that go to their mouths. No Bluetooth, no wireless headset, no chips placed in the brain, but they use the headset loan from a telemarketing agency that went out of service in 1983 (Nice job set director on this. Really professional. I hope you are currently available and reading this.) <br /> <br /> 8. I don't know who was in charge of special effects, but I could have done better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder without a battery. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a devoted Catholic before this "movie". But since I saw it, I know there is no God, because if there was, he would not have let this movie be produced. I am now an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I'm honest, I can't talk about the end. Last time I tried to explain it, I fell into a coma. However, people are bored, but curious (or brave) you are, but many are laughing at you. Think you want to get out of this movie, thanks DO NOT SEE THIS. It has literally ruined my life. AVOID ALL COSTS! <br /> <br /> Comment to the director: I hate you. You have ruined my life. After seeing this, I feel empty inside. My wife and children have left me and hate me because I couldn't speak or barely move after seeing this. I lost my job, my dignity and above all my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or the next (who doesn't look good on my newfound beliefs).
