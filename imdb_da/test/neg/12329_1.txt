Don't forget me, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did it, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there was a bunch of girls who went (another story for another time). When I started to see I noticed something, this movie was horrible. Now there are two types of horrible, Freddy vs. Jason horrible, where you and your friends lean back and laugh and laugh at how terrible it is, and then there's a movie like this. The cat in the hat failed to create an immediate interest in me. When I saw the first bit of it, I was not saddened by the pointless, but I felt I was somehow violated by the horrible movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that the director / producers / authors / whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors in the original book (red, black, white) on any sign, but the cat. Randomly or not, they also refused to intercept any of the original (and I hate to use this word but it suits) the rebellion's rebellion. The book was like an ice cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the film was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a leprous prostitute.
