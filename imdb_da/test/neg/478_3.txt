I'm 35. Bruce was the man of the Evil Dead and I still love to see ED1 and ED2. It was also fun to see him as the King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep, where he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is definitely not for Bruce's early fans. Either I get too old for this sh17, or I'm just not part of Bruce's audience anymore. I am positive children aged 9 to 13 will love this movie. But this overwhelmed matin√©e sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total interesting moments, and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor. Campbell talks better with Sam Raimi and gets their brains screaming together for a final evil dead reunion image to get my interest back. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry Bruce, it just doesn't cut it for me. Beware.
