The man (Gaston Modot) and the young girl (Lya Lys) go through the film consumed by passion for each other. They long to be together, but their moments together are constantly interrupted. The movie is stretched along with pictures and comes to an end after an hour ......... find lovers happiness ....? .. The movie starts interesting with recordings of scorpions, but you soon realize that it's all a pretentious piece of nonsense. It's made as a silent movie with occasional dialogue and it has a nonstop soundtrack that at one time is so annoying that you want to turn the sound down and want to watch it as a quiet movie. The continuous drums must have run the cinema audience angry. There are some really fun moments, such as when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is done in the name of art, so it's just pseudonus. The movie is crap.
