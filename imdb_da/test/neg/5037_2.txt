From the cultural world epicenter, four working class teenagers tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the last attempt to make the last century and they failed. Before the dust was cleared, bandwidth and SEX store owner Malcolm McLaren spent the money the Sex Pistols had earned to make a "mockumentary" about his own role in their success. The movie is called The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle (hint) and consists of very little footage of Sex Pistols that actually play music, and a lot of recordings of McLaren effectively call the audience's idiots. <br /> <br /> Cod-surrealistic nonsense, where guitarist Steve Jones is a detective at McLaren's tail, soon dissolves so he and drummer Paul Cook can jet out to Rio and spend time with "great train robber" Ronnie Biggs. Prepare yourself for the play of three very unpleasant men who dance naked to a fierce iron-free version of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about killing Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp), and another song sang in Ronnie's tone deaf whine containing the texts "God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady" (texts that Johnny Rotten would have considered impossible). Sid Vicious scenes are few and idiotic. Jumps out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing a bad boy biker song from the 50s. To play in the "Punk's a joke" theme of the movie, in an attempt to knock Sid into James Dean. I'm surprised that McLaren doesn't take credit for Siddy's death as well. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and My Way's infamous achievements. The dot is right there. Mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all. You don't need a whole movie, just watch the clip on YouTube. From Julien Temple's far superior (and more pleasurable) 2001 documentary follow-up, The Filth and the Fury, we got a more balanced / honest view of what happened in '78. But there were also a number of scenes that I would have liked to see in Swindle (since fury was basically a reediting of the same material). One was an animated Sid complete with Sides voice; "You're going to bet what is going out, okay, or I'll cut you openly" - of which still appeared on the cover of something else 7 inches - an excerpt was shown in rage, but I don't know what context originally appeared up. Was it in original prints, but removed after Sids death? Anything else? Fury also casts light on the movie Who Killed Bambi, which would have been the beautiful Hard Day's Night movie McLaren originally intended to make. The Star Sting (!) As a member of a gay New Romance group, and saw a skewed view more entertaining than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, it's a scam. If you are going, hire The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the music failure as a world-renowned polemic.
