simply i just looked at this movie just because of Sarah and also gives these 4 stars just because of her on the other hand This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theacting was horrible. The script was uninspired. This was a movie that held itself against it. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. It's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. This didn't even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, the more I think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually does and the more gaps we still find. A real shame really, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurks in there somewhere ... I might be a little tough and give the movie a 4/10, but considering the actors involved and again SARA obvious writing talent , this movie really should have delivered much more.
