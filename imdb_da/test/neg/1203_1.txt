I remember seeing this for the first time in the 80s as a teenager. Man, I've read the reviews on this garbage can and I'm surprised at the vote. This movie does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is no better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; don't understand me wrong. This film should be ruled out for its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so very poor dialogue. I cannot think of a redemption quality of this vomiting. This is not action / adventure. This is a bad joke on movies. Like to see Plan 9 with stock F-16 footage. This film not only tolerates logic and common sense within the framework of a military attitude, it sends a disturbing message. The military will not save your father from the impending evil of the Middle East B ***** DS. Then go out there and hijack a multi-million dollar weapon and blow him out of the back, anti-American Arabs scary links. Cuz you can't justify with these animals. This is a Bruckheimer flick without a budget. Gentle direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, resembling ... Iron Eagle.
