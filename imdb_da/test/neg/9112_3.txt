This movie is terribly suffering from "Julian Grant", and the incompetent leader, Steve Guttenberg, is making a huge effort to win a Bruce Willis look-like competition! The script is reckless Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser, and Kim Coates gives a decent performance. The movie is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what Hollywood studios thought, actually, to go forward, to weak instructor like Grant. And I want to say to Sean Bean "what did you even think about considering joining a movie like this after such great movies as GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
