Don Wilson stars as Jack Cutter (Ooh really hard name!) A vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver, cross or sunlight, but rather snatch their neck (how practical it goes down on the budget), and this is where Cutter runs into a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame) Night Hunter's action sequences shake without cause during the battle sequences, and although it's supposed to emphasize the mood just makes the movie more devastating. What's worse is that these fighting sequences have been bleached beyond belief, as Wilson's martial arts are disguised by uneven editing. Of course, the greatest interest comes from the fact that this really happens to Blade, but the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had Don Wilson in it. It's from Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people wouldn't pay to see. I am unfortunately a bottom feeder and I meet the part of the store that is looking for gems. In this work style you always go into turds. With Night Hunter I can only have the world's stinky ride. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (terrible)
