In spite of many positive reviews, it is a very slow movie with three mostly good actors who improvise the most banal dialogue you will ever hear. This is another road movie that really goes no where. The camera often goes out of focus and the constant panning of some of the long scenes is annoying. The three figures are attractive but remarkable. The cast also indicates what should be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word "guy". (Even Howard Stern has left this tired pesudo pronoun). The three primary actors and a supporting actor show a great promise. They are clearly comfortable and brave ones are allowed to be depicted as low and even stupid. The character players all look as if they are good amateurs who voluntarily voluntarily spoke a few lines. In fact, they all fit physically well with their roles. All in all, a boring 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity. This is among my ten worst movies all the time.
