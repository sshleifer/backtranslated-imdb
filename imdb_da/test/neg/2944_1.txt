Identifying this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Simply because it will suck your life right out of you. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to movie buffs everywhere. The reason is almost non-existent. The make-up is just plain horrible. And the actor is just not there. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owes anyone a great service to be convinced to show up in this movie. My wife picked up movies at the rental store because it had a picture of Jackie Chan on the front (as if he were in the lead) and thought a good JC flick would be fun to watch. This movie was interesting to watch the same way you can't help staring at the car's wreck when you pass by. You understand very quickly that the movie is not going to get better, but you continue to look strange how bad it gets.
