Although this is definitely a well-crafted piece of film making, it is thoroughly without any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> If you are already depressed, this movie will send you over the edge. <br /> <br /> If you feel a bit depressed, this movie will only be a thing of your life to feel bitter about. You will feel that only your luck has chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time. Otherwise, you may be able to do this through this movie unharmed (I didn't, BTW), probably knowing that your life is so much better than Jim's. So again, you might consider having fooled yourself, and it is in a much worse situation than you had previously understood. You may feel a little annoyed at Jim to bring this to your attention. You might slap him around with a wet fish. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is a lot I wanted to like this movie ... I hated it. It took a long miserable way down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason, looked back at itself and stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim doesn't have an epiphany, at least not one that is transported on the screen. Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. He does not discover anything that one can relate to and fails to make significant progress on his self-discovery journey. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one could live a good ending to this movie. As others have said, it's no Hollywood story, it's gritty and that's right. It is well made. Life is still a struggle at times. If anyone should know "the answer", they do well to shout it from the rooftops. I still feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. You feel that it means something if you just suffer through a little more of it, it will have something to say. It makes you stop and think. <br /> <br /> It doesn't. <br /> <br /> Again, I submit that this is a well-developed film. And can therefore be of value to a film student with a penchant for eg. lighting techniques using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it is completely out of order.
