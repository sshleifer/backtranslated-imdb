What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you get into when you rent this. The camera's quality reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why is the shot always so close to the actors! And why are they always centered? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors are so great, so it's blowing.) The scriptures and the dialogue are simply horrible. The intro scene with the British guy is fun. Just try listening to these words, they hardly have meaning, just go around in circles. The lines of the rest of the movie sound like they were out of romance and sci-fi novels, as if the authors had no idea what they were doing. The signs surely sound like they have no idea what they are saying. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. I feel bad for the actors tied to this project. Embarrassing!
