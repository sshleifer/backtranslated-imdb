Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was, in a word, "insane". Now, I doubt if this guy has ever seen it, because that's not how I would sum it up in one word. Real, absurd, um, more obnoxious ... would do it. Every time you think it can't get more dirty, it does. One of my special "favorites" was when Divine had her birthday party and when the police broke it up, they were slaughtered and eaten by the guests. I admit it is one of those films where it is so grotesque that you simply cannot look away, but it is by no means a creative work of art. It's pure shock value. <br /> <br /> On the back, the Jackass guys make out like a bunch of pussies.
