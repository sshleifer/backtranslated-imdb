I realize there are some fans who might like this movie. I realize that the idea of ​​"seeking God" may seem interesting to some, but it is really boring for me. The movie is simply boring. When it gets a little interesting, it gets stupid. Come on ... Kirk fight against God and win? How low can we possibly get? The only good part of the movie is the campsite for the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but after that the movie becomes boring, annoying, with nothing but good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk beat him).
