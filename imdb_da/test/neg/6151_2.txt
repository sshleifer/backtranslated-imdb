I watched this movie when it first appeared in the cinema. We all looked forward to seeing Mark Hamill resume his career, but we came out and we didn't want to bother it. Many people went out after about half an hour - I wish I had too. The basic principle seems okay, but the plot was ridiculously involved and destructive and runs out halfway through. It's totally unmemorable, and not a movie you want paid money to see. If you are really bored and it is on TV, it will help you kill a few hours (or help you nod!). 2.10
