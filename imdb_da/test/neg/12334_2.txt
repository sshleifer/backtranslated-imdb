It might be that the movie I saw was completely different from the one the others saw, but since the actors are the same, I can only believe that the cut I saw in Europe differs from what is circulating in USA. <br /> <br /> Still, it was the worst movie I saw in the last five years. (Followed closely by The Waterboy ...) Why: Because, in my opinion, this director has taken elements from each thriller ahead of it, blended them, put it in the wrong order with the wrong music and released it. <br /> <br /> (Examples: Nothing happens, the music gets scary, and nothing happens. The "grumpy" officer officer grumpy us in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class. buddy moment, coming out of nothing at the end, there is an inevitable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone. <br /> <br /> To see a smart movie: see Memento. To see a better thriller: see any thriller coming to mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing.
