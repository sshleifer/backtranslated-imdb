Based on a rather bland "best-selling", this movie - like most other life-style games - played more like a reenactment than a real movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter was not in it. The women of this age do not even have a span of 20 years, and the play is generally rather poor. The people in this were all clich√©s and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I don't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who see the network all the time are big. I only looked at it because my boyfriend wanted to see it so she didn't have to read the book she was borrowing from her sister. It wasn't made for anyone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end though, so she didn't think it was as terrible as I did.
