Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government does not believe in him (stupid facts # 1). He builds a house in deep underground and draws a lot to see who will go. Plus is willing to kill to save humanity (stupid facts # 2). How could a civilian population see what NASA couldn't do with millions of dollars of technology? Plus, the ends justify the means morally of this story is simply wrong! This movie is unlikely and incredible. What drove through these folks, why in hell do crap piles like the green light? Sometimes I wonder who should **** to get a movie made in this **** city.
