I usually give up following the benefits of the doubt and go easy on them. But it is very poor. The same as what happened in the first movie happens here again. The same. Only they wanted younger children to see it (it stands for the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny, but why they threw in a 'f * ck' is beyond me). <br /> <br /> They didn't even disturb Jackie Mason's character from Dangerfields. Let me explain that in CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield played a boorish real estate owner who scares the uptight members of the Bushwood Country Club. In this movie, Jackie Mason plays a boring real estate owner who scares the uptight members of the Bushwood Country Club. A great effort they have made to change the contents of the huh script? No, I think not. A very unfunny Dan Aykroyd shamefully copies Bill Murray's character. He even goes after the gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in the same way Murray did. <br /> <br /> There isn't a laugh to have had. A sample of 'comedy' in this movie: Jackie Mason gets ready for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his cloak. He moves to the door to dress in his bedroom when? The door handle breaks off. Wow!?! It's the best they can do. Eight years to think of a brand new successor, and that's all we get!?! I could have pulled a better script out of my ass. <br /> <br /> See it only if you are a deaf fan of the original. It is the only way you will find any kind of laugh in it. Everyone else clearly controls.
