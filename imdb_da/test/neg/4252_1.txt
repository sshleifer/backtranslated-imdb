A few words to the people here in the germen's cine club: The worst scream ever seen at this reputable cinema. A very bad script, a very bad actor, and a very bad movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie, see the very good "Mutantes worlds fritos anarquia radioactiva", or any movie has been well commented by me. Say no more.
