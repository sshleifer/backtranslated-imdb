This movie was an almost uninspiring movie. It was a non-moving story that certainly does not make you think of anything else, so where is all the strong moving material that other critics say about the movie. The three main actors are good and there are some laughs, but once again it becomes another movie you are watching in the hope of getting better and it just doesn't. I watched this movie last night and wished we hadn't wasted our precious time (while baby is sleeping) watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not planning to recommend this to my family and friends, as well as obviously anyone who wants to rent it. I was pretty much not impressed with everything about this movie.
