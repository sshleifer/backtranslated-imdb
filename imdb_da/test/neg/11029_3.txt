This movie does not have a very clear picture of what it is or will be. There are some good things when Stewart is on the screen and they give him some lines to work with. It works best early as a romantic comedy, but history is moving towards more dramatic territory and is being lost in the process. Over the last fifteen minutes, plot connections are just a series of dramatic clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The party with the plane feels like some remaining movies from another movie recorded. <br /> <br /> The main reason I would like to see this is if you want to say you've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's movies.
