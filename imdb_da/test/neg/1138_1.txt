I can't believe I bought this movie on DVD. I can't even remember it showing up in tv last year. Why in the world could they not have just made a real sequel to one of the best Christmas movies ever made? Damn and Randy Quaid look like he's been on the same fabric as Jerry Lewis. I didn't know about this movie until I bought it tonight and thought I'd check it out on IMDb and see how it was rated. Boy I made a mistake. If you read this review, be warned, stay away from it and just stay for the first Christmas holiday. Well at least I paid no more than 10 bucks for it. Maybe I can shop and get half of it back on Tower Records. So again maybe not. PS I still haven't seen it yet, my DVD player went on the fritz tonight and watched another wonderful movie, The Chronicles of Riddick woo freaking hoo.
