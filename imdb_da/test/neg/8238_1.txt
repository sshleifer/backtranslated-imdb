I fetched this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl who the parents deliberately take their daughter to. My first thought was that I have never been more ashamed of being an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down pretty appalling. Do not waste your time. As for the music, there are no more than 2 terrible songs, and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope I have shed some light on how scary this movie really is. Yes it can highlight how evil people in power, especially when it comes to religion, can be, but sitting down and watching almost 2 hours of this movie can do almost any gag. If your up for a good Indian movie see something by Director Mira Nair.
