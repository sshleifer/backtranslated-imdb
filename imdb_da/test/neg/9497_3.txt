I love Ustinov's characteristic, literary narrative. And the photograph is quietly nice. We put the film on for our 3.5 year old, who kind of walked in and out of the room. So for our first view we only saw approx. 1/3 of the film and was completely charmed. Then, when we sat down for family time, we were all persecuted by the violence and life-threatening situations into which the poor otters came. Halfway through the movie there is a rack of dead, bloody, ferocious animals. Lots of blood, not just a little. So at the end there is a wild battle with a dog, so the blood blocks the water. You'd think given the G rating, that's all you want to see ... that they will IMPLY that one of the animals died. Nix. They pull the carcass out of the water and show it clearly for several traumatizing seconds. Personally, as an adult, I love horror movies and are fine with violent films Ala Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Heck, I love the ultra violent Battle Royale. But it is not children films and does not advertise as such. If you consciously educate your youth to see life's hard reality for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. If you are like me and my wife, you might want to save your kids nightmare and avoid it.
