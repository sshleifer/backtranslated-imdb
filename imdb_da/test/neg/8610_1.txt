Man oh man, this was a piece of dog sh # t. I read a couple of reviews here, having seen the case in the local video store and thought to myself ........ Oh this seems like a half decent movie .Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, no way to fail. Jesus, if I could only shed my eyes and not remember this movie, I would be happy. The main actor had the most beautiful, gay voice ever. He was really bad .... "Amandaaaaaaaa ....", "I'll save my girlfriend ...." F * ck off! My friend and I actually changed the audio track on the DVD to Portuguese so we didn't have to hear the guy's voice. Subtitles and all ... and this enhanced the movie. I'm serious if your anything like me and wondered what this movie was like .. STOP WONDERING. I have answered. WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! No good action, no good deeds and only the slightest smattering of nudity. Just clean sh * t for 90 minutes. Do not rent this, buy it, think about it or watch it at 3:00. It just doesn't cut the cake ...... at all .... in any way. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You would have a better time. I'm sure.
