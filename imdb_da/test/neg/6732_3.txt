Could they possibly be worse than this? Probably. But after all, Steven Seagal gets what he does. Good kind; This time, instead of killing the evil ones, he just kills them. At the reputation of being a poor robber, Seagal is hired to deliver a special package from France to America. But it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and destroy the mission. The battles just don't have enough bites and the big bangs are just big, and that's all. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast member who should not appear as wood. Also in the cast are: Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Don't blame everyone on Seagal for this clunker.
