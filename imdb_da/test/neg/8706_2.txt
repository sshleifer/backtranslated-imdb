With a name like "10 Bids" you would expect a movie to be representative of the account in the Bible, especially Exodus. Not so here. This is the standard procedure with any Bible Hallmark-made movie. Remember "Noah" ?? It was complete fiction and one of the worst movies ever made. At least, this movie had "some" truth to the original story. But Menerith, who was a great character in this movie - half-brother to Moses, is not in the original story. Other signs were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated. So what can you ask? Because this should be representative of the actual story; otherwise, some might and believe it is the way it really happened. In today's age, people get their religion from film rather than church and read the Bible. It is also a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. Scripture is already written. Why change it? Except for the account in Exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have Cecil B. DeMille movies to compare it to, which is clearly a much better presentation. <br /> <br /> The night the first aired, my wife was eager to see it. I told her not to get her hope because it was a Hallmark movie. She looked confused and said, "Why? Hallmark does good movies". It can be so, but they are slaughtered in the Bible. I'm sorry to say I was correct. Not just the story, but also the action. With today's technology, you need to be able to make a wonderful Bible movie. I'm still waiting...
