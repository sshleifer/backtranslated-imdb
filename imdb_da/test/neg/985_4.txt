The most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. Busey's imitation of Holly is accurate - but who will hear Gary Busey sing "Maybe Baby"? Typically, the members of Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud respectively) instead of as humans or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old Jewish looks come in saying he uses the same techniques as Mozart. It is just this kind of naughty statement that makes cinema biographies like this (and "Amadeus" about the aforementioned Mozart) so worthless. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly's outstanding styles and songs made in a B variation.
