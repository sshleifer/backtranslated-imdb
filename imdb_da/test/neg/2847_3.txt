Worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on her pocket after she is attached proportionately to her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive, she follows the lead over the state, her danger increasing at each stop. Chasing her is the traditional 'good-cop' and 'bad-cop' couple of partners. One is convinced of her innocence, the other is more interested in closing the case and coming home. This couple is often able to corner their suspects, but never quite intercept her. All the main players meet in a remote city in the desert, and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! This was a bad movie. The driver acted as if she were calm. The police could not find a suspicion that he or she is in the police station (this happens twice), and everyone else is as dimensional as possible. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
