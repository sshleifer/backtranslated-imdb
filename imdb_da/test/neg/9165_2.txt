I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after having loved the comic book series in my childhood, and this almost ruined that love for me. Jason Lee, David Sevilla in the movie, is horrible. I understand that it is not easy to trade CGI characters that aren't actually there, but I really found his performance terribly associated with all the other non-animated characters. The chips were adorable but sometimes obviously moving the sign of history together, and so I did not tempt me to stay in the theater for more than half an hour in the movie. If you feel like watching this movie, rent it at most. It's not worth eight bucks to watch it in theaters unless you want a good laugh at the horrible play.
