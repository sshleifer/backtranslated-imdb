Red glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think. This director has made some fantastic demented visions from the future. However, this movie was dull pretentious crap. The opening scene showed great promise of what the cover text and description promises a surreal live action-amime style future noir. I feel like I got it with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With the Red Range, I was only driven to feel uncomfortable to want what the hell was. The movie was hardly reasonable for me, and I couldn't care less about the people in it. It would all be ok if the film was effective art. While the opening scene looked interesting, and the scene with the giant robotic person who held the giant machine gun in the rain, so out, it didn't see the movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
