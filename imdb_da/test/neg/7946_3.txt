It is New Year's Eve, a cop-killer (in the form of, Laurence Fishburne) ending in an area that closes the decay to snow. When the people are besieged, the police have to keep up the disadvantages of survival. This rebuilding of the John Carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists, take all the excitement and add an angry John Lequizamo to the cast, right? The first movie was exciting, gritty and a joy to watch. This is more Hollywood, klich√©d and painful to see. The only thing I took from this movie was OCD can be very annoying ... VERY. The ending song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment from Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with optional comment; 5 minute "armed and dangerous" featurette on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minutes "behind the Precinct Walls"; "Plan of Attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 and a half minutes behind the scenes featurette; "Unleashed" Trailers, "White Noise": Chucky Seed "<br /> <br /> Miscelanious: I got this for Best Buy and it came with a bonus disk including the first 2 minutes of" Cry Wolf ", a 10 minute first look at "Unleashed", trailer for that movie, and a Fuzion interview with John Leguizamo
