This was definitely the most tragic pile of cinema I've ever witnessed. Not only was the name a complete misnomer - since the film has nothing to do with piranhas - but the play is so hollow and outdated as an attempt to make a kind of plot. When you watch this movie, don't worry about spending every other question when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately, I waited until the end in my case. It is two hours in my life that I will never be able to regain.
