Oh God. This sequel has a mirror, this time housing the evil spirit of a psychopath who murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville home. The mirror caught the entire ugly episode of the horrified family who didn't have time to prepare for their intruder. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) of a bum (which just happens to be his lunatic father and the man responsible for killing the family) and it is evil, soon terrorizing them on a ceiling (. Like Keyes, Pal Suki paints, depicted by Julia Nickson-Soul, where he lives when they look at it. Soon Keyes's nightmare, looking through his father's eyes as he guns into the family in cold blood, worried he might follow in his footsteps. Soon he sees other events through his father's eyes as the terrible daydreamers based his mother's head on the word of an institution or experience a moment inside the cell, as the doctor administered a drug to immobilize him. <br /> <br /> Beautifully solid that supports that deserve better than stuck in junk like this, like David Naughton (American Werewolf in London) as the owner of the ceiling Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a fun ditsy, rather weird secretary nurse in the asylum (the one who kept Keyes' father) soon shut down. <br /> <br /> Rounding the movie, The sexy, throbbing Lala Sloatman as Keyes' supporting girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (... he was about to start an affair with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic enemy trying to provoke his son to kill innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler (a nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (. by Nickson-Soul) who meets an unfortunate death while separating paintings from each other as revenge for his dismissal. /> <br /> This movie is a bad special effects movie that only uses the Amityville title as a cash-in. The franchise has never been so great at first, but since every successor was green, it grew worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the infamous house becomes "obsessed" things that plague people. The cast, however, tries hard, but the material (.. a mirror causes chaos and murder through supernatural means) lacks quality .. and the rather mediocre special effects do not help. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement like this. Everything is not lost, you will see Sloatman always wearing super short skirts (.. or her husband's shirt in panties) showing her legs all the way through. Hey, you gotta find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! The coldest part of the film was portraits of demons painted by Nickson-Soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking at it.
