Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad about greed, corruption and travel through Africa, was at least a dull reading. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who enters the deep part of Africa to save Kurtz, something of a wonderful ivory consultant who allegedly went crazy. This conclusion arose when ivory stopped entering the main port. The basis of the story is Conrad, who writes lavishly of the surroundings, he puts the scene wonderfully, but possibly a little to a large extent. The story seemed more like a watercolor painting, as was the case with the slowly creeping mild action story that Conrad might have thought of breaking out. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, after reading a book, you might see the movie feature can help match some thoughts with them in the book or vice versa. Not so with the Heart of Darkness, even with supporting role as master actor John Malkovich, the movie only confused me more, there seemed to be no real protagonists in the movie, no one stood out for the others, not of the extensive symbolism was explained. It was pretty bland and drudging to say the least. <br /> <br /> All in all, respect for the author, The Heart of Darkness is a true short novel masterpiece, it touches on some very serious issues, Marlow's lies, and the greed of Kurtz. It is not a book to be taken lightly and will put you in a rather gloomy mood. A book like this I feel can be heavy for many people. However, I would recommend this book to those who yearn for a sad pseudo-action story without a happy textbook.
