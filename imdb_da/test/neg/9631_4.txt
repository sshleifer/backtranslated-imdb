In 1971, it became increasingly clear that Hammer film studios were on their way out. HANDS OF THE RIPPER is a case where even the idea tastes desperate - Jack's spirit The Ripper has his own daughter! Yes okay, no one expected a documentary, but this plot seems to scrape the bottom of the barrel for stupid assumptions, and you find yourself questioning why the producers brought Jack The Ripper into the story. Was it here to give the movie a good title? <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not impressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap TVM feel, but you know you won't see a classic Hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is ridiculously inappropriate. I think the composer tried to make the theme light and touching, but the music looks like something out of a mushroom romantic movie. I will give some credit as they take their roles seriously in what is far from serious movie. I did not enjoy this movie much, and it immediately reminded me of the Phantom Raspberry Blower Of London Town from the two minstrels I had laughed at in the weeks before I saw this
