All of the airport's movies are stinkers, but this is the biggest turkey of them all. The formula was different for this because it focused on two catastrophic flights and a lot of plot on the ground, while the other movies focused on just a catastrophic flight and lesser plot on the ground. Stunts with Concorde are worth looking for the laughs, although the special effects are not as terrible as I would expect for a movie of this quality made in 1979. George Kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in Paris is completely unnecessary (and did me a little bit). Poor Martha Raye was referred to a role where she did nothing but relieve her gut again and again in Concorde's bathroom. There are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous movies, giving you another reason not to watch this movie.
