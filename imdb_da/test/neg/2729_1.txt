You would have more excitement by cutting off your testicles than seeing this, clearly a trick to getting you to rent "Descent" instead of "The Descent", which is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> This is a total rip off of "The Core" and much, much worse with regard to special effects, I could do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of tinfoil, I mean to come continue! .... that "mole" thing, living more resembles a vibrating dildo than an underground vehicle. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it - if you find yourself in your room, you have a fun smell for days after, and you get this ugly feeling in the back of your head that you have to kill yourself or something.
