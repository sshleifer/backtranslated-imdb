Now, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try to take the edginess of the 1999 theater version (actually copying some of the ideas from it), but tones things a little to bring it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster and schizophrenic production. And as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there, the character of Fanny Price is no where to find. Instead, there is a strange child-like, bleached blonde woman running around who never quite develops as a sign. At least in the 1999 film, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly established as a rebellious tomboy who is too clever for himself. This "Fanny Price" is a complete puzzle. Today I really want to see a dramatization of Mansfield Park, which actually contains a depiction of Fanny character as she was written by Jane Austen. A sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a foam personality and weak constitution. She is reserved in a way and painfully honest, but also strong in her beliefs, incredibly loyal, extremely intelligent, and remarkably clear. A little late is blooming, it is only until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward youth to independent young woman. And she doesn't want anything more in life than having any real need for those she loves most. It is a wonderfully complex sign that I look forward to one day looking faithfully portrayed.
