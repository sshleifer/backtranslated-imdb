Stu Ungar is considered by many to be the biggest poker / gin player all the time - an extraordinary self-destructive force in nature - small in stature, but a big heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a kind of Hallmark movie about the dangers of gambling. Of course he wins, he loses, he blows everything about sex, drugs and more games, we get it, but where is the right game - where is it that made him the biggest card player at all times. <br /> <br /> Much too flat, and frankly boring in places, it gets four because we learn something about Stu man but Stu card player, nada. Beautifully shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a movie about cards: frankly, ESPN's coverage of the world series is more reliable than this one. <br /> <br /> A waste of a great chance.
