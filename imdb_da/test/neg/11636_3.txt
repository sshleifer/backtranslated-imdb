This movie didn't make it for me, an avid SNL fan for the last 14 years. Jamie Gertz's portrayal was ok, but there was something so off-putting about the film itself. Facts presented in the film are quite skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it so it would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor did he have anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her at SNL, we go through the study with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall around 1988-1989, not 1975. And let's talk about the cast - who are these people ?? I've never heard of one of them. Real dissatisfaction. This movie shows why television movies are just that, TV movies.
