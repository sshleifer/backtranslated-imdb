Silly hikers go camping in the Utah mountains just to run into a murderous, disinfected gypsy. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a beautiful round of the mill's slasher films, which mostly suffer from a lack of imagination. The characters of the offense are all too familiar idiot teens, which means you don't even care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has too many cheesy moments and is cushioned with endless, unnecessary natural beginnings. But it has some moments of interest for slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere and a decent music score by Don Peake. It's still as usual for dead camper movies. <br /> <br /> There is much better movie in this vein, but everywhere the Prey can be enough to be capable of slasher fans. Although one might be rewarded to see Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003) or Final Terror (1983) again. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
