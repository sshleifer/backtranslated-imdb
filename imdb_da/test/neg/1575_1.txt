Put the film down and back slowly. The action rivals a highschool game, the plot is the tread, and the production values ​​are slightly higher than community theater. Goofs are so abundant that it becomes a weaker one. Rooms are switched, the dead moves, dogs used for wolves, men shot blank with .45 caliber guns can go and run snowmobiles, blouses button and unbutton without human touch ... this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie. I almost went out when I saw the average rating. There is no accounting for taste. BTW, there is no nudity.
