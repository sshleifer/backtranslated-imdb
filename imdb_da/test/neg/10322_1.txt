The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock at the front, but we discovered that it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is very little in this movie. However, you can see how far she has come. <br /> <br /> The one bright spot in the film was besides the small part, a couple of stage scenes, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so high that the dialogue is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialogue has become redone without any background noise at all, which is disturbing. For example, when they are in the car, the sound from the car is too high and then suddenly there is no extra noise. The director is fond of close-ups on faces, and then it is clear that the film has become over-dubbed because the words do not fit the lip movements. Through most of the film, the voices that people speak in a can. <br /> <br /> Background music when there is music is distracting rather than adding to the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction is ridiculous. Ugly camera angles and sound effects make the movie a joke, especially in times of tension, as in the middle of gunfights. Scripture is horrible. There are some subplots that do not make sense, and most of the signs come out and look very stupid because there is no explanation whatsoever for their motivation. The author / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were together in Vietnam, but none of them makes sense. These top killers and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people move. The actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning. It is simply a combination of poor routing and poor writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that we initially thought we had stumbled on other students' films that just happened to Sandra Bullock in it. If you like to laugh with really poorly finished student films, then this movie is for you. Otherwise avoid this movie.
