This is the tedious tale of the self-absorbed affair between two unlikely people, one of whom is married to another. It is high placed on my list of the most boring movies ever and I am a die hard romantic. My husband selected after the first hour of his three, after which little had been expelled. The desert landscape is spectacular, with the endless sand and sunshine on Katharine's golden hair. However, filmography does not make a brilliant movie unless it is a National Geographic travel suggestion. The magnificent Sahara landscape in this badly imagined tale is like putting perfume on a pig. The film is about a badly burned, dying pilot called Count Laszlo de Almasy, who is back in a Canadian care nurse, Hana, during World War II Italy. He seems to remember a little of his life, but through a book in his possession his story is very slowly revealed by a man from his past called Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears at his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to map out the Sahara desert. He entered into an affair with wife, Katherine, of a co-founder who turned out to be a British spy. Meanwhile, Laszlo's nurse has his own affair with a Sikh nickname, Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines. <br /> <br /> My disgrace with this movie is many, length and tedium to begin with. I'm not doing anything special, it's simply not a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection to Almasy sketchy. He gives a torture scene, but does not seem to be any significant purpose in the film. The core problem is that the two parties in this affair, Almasy and Katharine, are extremely unsympathetic characters, low and boring. They are simply not so cozy, and there is no one to cheer for. Almasy is cool, secluded, haughty, and ultimately obnoxious by another man's wife. Katharine is also detached and uncomfortable, not to mention having a regrettable lack of guilt or feeling at all for her imperfect but loving man ... except steering a tiny tear in the corner of the eye when he dies. <br /> <br /> This is a tale of LUST rather than love, with such gems as 'I can still taste you'. Almasy blames ridiculously for a colleague's erotic occupation with the indentation in his beloved neck, probably more indicative of a focus on Katharin's body. The offense for this unjust infidelity is the rude man, Geoffrey, who is treated as a little more than an unpleasant nuisance. It is quite sordid and disgusting, Katharin's charade feels weak, so these lovers can indulge in their very frightening outrageous passion, all of which Silent Night is sung in the background. I'm not sure if the intention was to contrast the carol's purity with their selfish desire, but I was certainly not impressed with the sacred undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine, but their sex scenes come across as cold, selfish, lustful and sometimes straightforward ... not warm, loving, giving or even really passionate. If one of these two feels a feeling for the other, it is a completely selfish and absolutely NOT love that I define the word. <br /> <br /> Almasy returns to the swimmers hole to retrieve the body of his beloved coming over as constructed rather than moving. Katharine must have expired only moments earlier, as she shows excellent color and hardly looks like a killer, not at all equal. Of course, it is far too dramatic, as romantics who look at this story (usually I would be one of them) would not appreciate a past due, bad body. To retrieve his incredible lover's body, he has betrayed his comrades and allies by giving his cards to the Nazis, the English being thrown as the villain in the play. Whether or not he holds his final promise to Katharine, his treacherous action is not something I admire much. <br /> <br /> Chicken seems to be a pleasant guy and Hana is generally sympathetic, but their romance is not least engaging, only a short war period flirts with the parties, indicating little trauma of farewell. Moving back and forth between the two settings (former Sahara desert and present-day Italy) proved to be distracting and unpleasant, but really both stories were boring as a dishwashing detergent. The only spark of interest for the whole picture was Kips tense my disarmament scene. <br /> <br /> Not quite heartless, I had some sympathy for the current Almasy's heavily burnt and dying state. But perhaps my big complaint with this movie is euthanasia at the end when Hana commits her patient to giving him an overdose of morphine. We must feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because, of course, she has love for Almasy, crying as she prepares the mortal syringe and reads loudly from his allegedly passionate Herodotus book to console him when he dies. <br /> <br /> The amazing instructor David Lee's masterpieces should not be offended by this pathetic, immoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in Lean movies (Doctor Zhivago, Brief Encounter) are the sympathetic signs that show admirable restraint, guilt and little regard for the betrayed spouse as opposed to the total self-absorption of this couple. In Ryan's Daughter, the cuckold man shows touching loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This movie is a seemingly intellectual, hugely rated bit of dull and obnoxious drift that unfortunately passes as a great love story. Its best picture Oscar doesn't speak well for the academy. For those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie, the answer is simple. It's terrible.
