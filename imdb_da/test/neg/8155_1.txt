This movie was in a box of 20 others, of varying quality, and I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the pile. It is pointless to go through the plot, what was of it and pointed out what was wrong, since I didn't get all day and life is too short, reminding me, I just lost about 85 minutes of mine to see this tripe. <br /> <br /> The act was devilishly bad in a way that made it fun, even though it was only while comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any Laurel & Hardy fans moan. One of the barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic T * ts, which would have been okay if I hadn't had to watch them bob around when she waddled on the screen. <Br /> The lowest I can give is one, and it probably deserves it to have Heather Thomas in it, as she was definitely sexy and charitable, even though her play was just as bad as everyone else.
