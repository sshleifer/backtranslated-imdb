* Spoilers here * <br /> <br /> Where do I start with how stupid this movie was? 'Mole size people living under the garden attack residents in a big house' !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I didn't realize that the protagonists were not poltergeists, etc. But 10 inch tall goblins that looked mighty easy to kick hard and far. I continued to watch it because I like to watch movies through to the end even horrible. this movie was horrible. My boyfriend, who went to sleep within the first ten minutes, except to find it good to sleep, thought it was fun that I had bothered to see it all. Little tips even in large quantities (the thought is stupid, I know) is being as scary and threatening as flat cola. They only managed to turn a guy up 'bad' and kill a cat before they were blown up, The End. I mentioned it sucked right?
