The first DH wasn't that big, but I didn't really expect it. But this horrible movie was just over criticism. I'm really trying to look at the bright side and give movies like this a chance, but I just couldn't find a really good thing about this. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just so boring. The story of the movie is really not that bad. In fact, it's something original. But the film form is really as bad as many say. In my opinion, this one is right up there with "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know that many people really throw and put movies as such, but I really can't think of other good things to say about it.
