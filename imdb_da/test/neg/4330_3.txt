This movie has a fantastic cast. MGM took some of his finest character actors and starred them in a movie with the usually sweetest Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star as three greedy old bachelors living in the same home. While they have accumulated a fortune over the years, they have also been selfish jerks. One of them has an idea to donate some properties to buy a good name (like Carnegie), but it turns out to be the property they will give away that actually belongs to O'Brien. And as she is an orphan, they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great philanthropists. There is also a goofy plot involving fairies led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And since O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little people make up much of the plot. Frankly, I absolutely hated this part of the movie and wished they had just lost it completely. Instead, the story could still have been about sweet Margaret, who melts the old old men's hearts - it would have worked. But ... the "little people"?!? Sheesh! Overall, the actors are trying very, very hard, but the plot's stupidity and the deadly serious way they tried made me hug. I noticed many people liked this movie - I think I'm just an old grouch! I found the movie terribly difficult to see.
