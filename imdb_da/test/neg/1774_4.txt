Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I enjoy the guy! His movie brings some flair to those who are not actually picked up by the director or the producer, but by him! Recycled plots ... check. Rip-offs of better movies ... check. Wooden effect ... check. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he has been effective in Hollywood glory like Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow) he has really not been offered a script worthy of his talents; And yes, he has an actor talent than being eye-candy. This film gives a little hint of what Van Dien can offer, but is knocked down by the production of it all. The script can be developed better (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). The management can be better exploited (see Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk To Dawn). DP could have made the desert more exotic (see Russ Meyer's faster Pussycat Faster Kill!). This script is weak because it is something we've seen before many other times, so the double / triple crosses are expected. The direction is weak because it does not offer anything new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments. The camera sometimes paints a lovely autumn trout flavor to it, but at other times it does not exploit the burning light, and the initial sequence is horrible in cornflower blue. Now to the actor. .. van dien shows some grace and charisma to his jake He also does not become too methodical or too campy in his role. A good balance especially since the rest of the player seems too distracted about how to act in this movie (bad script or bad direction ... you give your opinion). The only other worth mentioning is Bryan Brown's villain as it gives the only real credit to appear in this movie ... aspiring actors forget to try to learn how to shop in green screen, try to learn to shop a horrible script and take notes on Bryan Brown in this movie. He adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counter to Van Diens character. Jake always seems to be one step ahead or check every situation, whether it's his control. Femme fatale is weak (this is a desert noir after all) and is another nail in the movie's coffin (you decide ... script or direction). The Rosalita character should have been disturbed forward in the film rather than being pushed into the tray later to make room for the real femme fatale. Then watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; And for fun, try to skip a stone over the plot holes twisted in the movie.
