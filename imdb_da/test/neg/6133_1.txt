Okay, first I should say I suppose this was only made by a group of friends with a limited budget. With that in mind, it really should not be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher. But still ... After giving it a chance, it still violated some basic film-making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me were scared. A lot. <br /> <br /> Think: Blair Witch in a car, but really boring. <br /> <br /> Think: You left the camcorder on the dashboard and registered yourself to get lost in the park at night for an hour and then make your friends see it. <br /> <br /> The worst part (POSSIBLE SPOILS ALERT ... IF SPOILING HERE IS POSSIBLE) was at a time the picture bouncing back and you may think you'll have to see it all over again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Silliness aside, this is a great idea for a low-budget easy-go-make-a-movie-evening movie. But the concept goes a fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's just say that it wasn't really good. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. First, I thought it was the director's plan - you should be lulled into a sense of security, and then really scary things would start to happen. But no. I continued to try to find good things to say about it (and I had plenty of time to think) and I would say the music was pretty cool. And I have to give the female head credit to stand around herself and look scared for a real, really long time. But it is. The actors who played "infected" people looked like they were making fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from Bug wearing his Edgar suit from "MIB." Chances are, if you want to see this movie for some strange reason, it's on DVD or Tivo, so you can speed it up when you wait for something to happen, get too hard. I hate being so critical of something, but at the same time I have seen many similar films, and nothing has ever been so painful. If they just chopped half an hour out of it and added some scary things, it could be decent. Maybe it will be the director's cut ...
