This is a disappointing adaptation of the James Lee Burke short story "In the Electric Mist of the Confederate Dead". It is pretty badly acted primarily because of the miscasting of the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, a normally fine actor, only captures Burke's "Dave Robicheaux". As Robicheaux's main nemesis, John Goodman does a sloppy job as the "heavy". The guy who plays Robicheaux actress buddy does not resemble a former "A" list leading man. The rest of the movie is first and foremost thrown to the no-name locals, who just don't make right for a big-time novel. <br /> <br /> The movie and Jones' performance is also too hurried for one thing. Robicheaux in the Burke series of novels gives the feeling that he suits his environment most of the time, is laid back and slower. It is like the deep southern and southern Louisiana. So at times, Robicheaux is almost manic in his efforts. Jones moves at a fast pace throughout the movie. He does not vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. About the only good thing about this is the setting. On the whole, the film gives an impression of a television movie.
