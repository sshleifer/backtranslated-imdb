Synopsis Correction: The end doesn't show Ben cruising online for guys. He looks at Arabic language courses at The Presido Military Acadamy in San Francisco. Perhaps participating in the war in Iraq as a translator, (FYI - many of the outrageous discharges from "D'ont, ask Dont, tell them they have been Translators (they are now in short supply). Ben also asked Russian. movie is a good time capsule of life in Manhatten, but a bit of non-reality here, mostly a good laugh at Lame social skills and the sad show of "Grown up" twenty somethings does not evolve beyond college party fashion. Also a brief study of the ever-changing scene in Manhatten (somehow it always remains close to the edge of the same BS). See the films "Englishman in New York" and "The New Twenty", both good at nostalgia. I think the movie "thieves" shows how far the blur between gay and straight is developed. <br /> <br /> These two movies are GAY Time Travel, definitely !!!!
