A group of tourists are stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They have to stay overnight and, as you probably suspect, it is not called Snake Island because it is just so much fun to say - it has a story that people disappear one by one because of it large snake stock, which is just what happens to these poor stupid souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off-screen snake attacks and miserable performances from NOBODY actors. The only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene, which is not something that could not be seen in a PG13-rated movie, people. If you are into snake film than check out SSSSSSS, but don't torture yourself with this crap.
