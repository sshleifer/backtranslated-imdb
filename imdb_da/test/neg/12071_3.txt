Woody Allen (who I must admit at the beginning has never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930s jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while, so quickly faded. Penn does a credible job in the role that shows a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself, who might explain why Woody would be attracted to this project) who cannot maintain relationships and whose twin skills (except guitar ) shot rats by dump and see trains. <br /> <br /> There is not much coherence in history. It is told in a way by a number of modern jazz "experts" (one of which is Allen himself) that relates their various theories and interpretations of various events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have gained a relatively interesting life story from his creators, who probably should have done a better job with it. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. For me? The best thing I can give it is a 3/10.
