Need to take a deep breath for this ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that attempted to go far beyond budget constraints. Blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like Pitch Black). Horrible play. Infinitely slow motion scenes of characters stretching aimlessly over the dunes. Meandering dialogue that does nothing to promote history. Signs carrying turtle neck sweater on a desert planet with two suns. A "cargo" ship manned by a camouflage-wearing crewmember of firearm soldiers (why should you even have forest camouflage in the room anyway?). Some of the worst casting choices in the history of no budget film production - a steroid raised "captain" that comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander, and a "convict" that looks and is about as dangerous as a rabbit rabbit. 70 minutes in length, of which 35 could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of "compression of time through editing" ... I will not continue. Suffice it to say, while some components of this horrible movie can (and should) be forgiven because of the low budget; The bad idea, ridiculous plot holes and string-inducing script are unforgivable on * any * budget. The end result is a dull, boring, waste of time. Sorry guys, I hate being so hard on an amateur movie, but you have no excuse to show this kind of work.
