I love bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 from Outerspace, etc. And this movie fits right in. Do not believe anyone who tells you that is good movie. It's pretty awful. Tim Curry's accent moves from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There is a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the monkey's sign language. There is a scene with a killer whip moving around a river like a big white shark. There are people jumping up and down Mt. Kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it. This thing is ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculously, I rolled on the floor. It is totally unlikely. I loved every minute of it.
