Bulletproof is clearly a one-time film. The kind where the balls rustle good guys and bad guys are sprayed everywhere, so much so that you really shouldn't see them as human. The swings between the lines of Wayans and Sandler are extensive indeed. They try hard, but unfortunately and of course, the persona does not make a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays a beautiful villain, but he always had the redneck edge ready. My favorite scene is the repetitive clip of a TV ad where Caan reveals that virtues in America can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in each garage. Apart from that, it's a buddy movie with guns for brains. Pass this on.
