The movie wasn't actually that bad, especially plot-wise, but the doughy (and hairy!) Actor they chose for the lead was a bit chintzy in the acting department. I would have chosen another. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was very ingenious, and the protagonist who questioned everything he had ever known made him comfortable, but not so much when there is a pasty blob for a leading actor. <br /> <br /> The story was interesting. It raises the question of how the subject of the cloning will be handled in the future. Cloning would certainly not be allowed for that purpose in the movie, but it is still a valid argument even today. Clones are still humans ... right? <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't very special, but it's still much better than any of the cheese released in the 70s. Let's not forget "Giant Spider Invasion." I give it a 4 as it didn't stink completely, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You will like this movie, but it won't be your favorite.
