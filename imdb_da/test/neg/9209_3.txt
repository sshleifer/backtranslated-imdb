The movie opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who just finished his lunch in a neighborhood deli. It seems he doesn't have enough money to cover the check. Instead of arriving at his plastic, he looks furtively to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) had observed him from the other side of the delicacy. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is embellished with what went too cool back in the 1980s with a brunette side cut. She follows him out to let him know she saw what he was doing. He tries to deny it, but cannot escape her accusation. Thinking he's in it, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says she's not working for the delicacy and then giving him a ride back to work. <br /> <br /> As she heads in the opposite direction, they begin their cavorting over the Central Atlantic Seaboard. <br /> <br /> We're going to get titled so thoroughly modern "Lulu" puts straight-laced Charlie in humiliating situations. It's okay when the two consenting adults get a little kinky in a motel room, but off-putting when they are teeming with paying the check at a family-style restaurant. Stealing the work of hard-working people is not my idea of ​​"wild". Charlie is a jerk. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is a loony jerk. She begins to walk past Charlie as her husband. First to her mother (who foolishly tolerates charade) and then to her appropriately timed 10-year high school reunion (an event later used by another for-cool-for-its-own-good movie "Grosse Pointe Blank"). The "marriage" comes as a surprise to "Lulu "'s real husband (Ray Liotta), who has just been released from prison to armed robbery. Ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is. <br /> <br /> I can't add any irony by writing that I first saw this by sneaking into the cinema. No, I'm not doing that kind of thing. I taped it out of cable TV and assured you that I see it strictly in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br /> So I came to think about why I lost it when I didn't like it much and conclude 20 years ago I was on a reggae park and the "Something Wild" soundtrack has prominent reggae. The final credits start with the treatment of Sister Carol, who performs her version of "Wild Thing".
