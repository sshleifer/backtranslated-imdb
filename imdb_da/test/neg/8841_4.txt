Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with a single common point: the small washing town of Obaba. In this movie, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young journalist as a continuum. The result is a strange movie as it has the protagonist (the film spends about 20 minutes for each story) except for the town of Obaba. Every story is really well explained and the fact is that they become very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but it doesn't say too much. The only good thing in the movie is the precious scenarios. It's filmed in a very precious valley, and it's more comfortable to spend time watching the scenario rather than paying attention to the story.
