This movie could have been oh so much better. It is a beautiful story in very tried times, and yet it was so poorly executed. The leading players have previously done good jobs, and mostly they do an appropriate job in this movie. Although their dialogue sometimes seems silent and forced. The management could have been more precise. Most of the criticism must go to the authors who took a good story and made it boring. In short, there are thousands of many better ways to spend 2 hours.
