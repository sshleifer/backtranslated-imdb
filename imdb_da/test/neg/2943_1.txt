In the beginning I thought it was bad because I had great expectations for this movie, but having said that, it's so bad. I was almost caught up in hp's promoting bad stars in bad movies. hk's new generation of actors and actresses not to mention bad scriptwriters brings the industry down. At the moment I'm still trying to find out how high it is. Usually you can't lose in a movie with donnie yen and echin (forget Jackie, he's past his top). but then I should find out when twins were on the cover. It's cheesy, campy, very corny, I'm trying to laugh at some of the jokes, but not only is the effect very minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not fun. I'm sorry I bought the movie. The only reason some people think it is so good is that they are brainwashed in the hype, the twins are sweet and everyone likes them, and all they do is good and fun. and that if you like twins then you are updated ... sugar ... i miss the good hp movie days when jet li and stephen chow movies dominated box office ... <br /> <br /> movies from mainland china is much better than this and they are shot at lower budgets.
