The opening of "The Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but most we get is a journey of lots of stock footage and padding (and the odd leopard attack). The movie is relaxed when you want the poignant, and tries to inject interest in the procedure of badly staged fighting between different wild animals (I did not know that lions and wild boar were natural enemies in the wild, did you? The big cats stuck on to hunt plant-living animals, but apparently the producers knew better). <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual good job of pushing the crossbones, and Marie Windsor is reasonably credible as the progressively thinking rajah's daughter (lovely eyebrows, btw!). But Rod Cameron is hardly aware as the hunter returns as his only survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand for his time, but here he comes out as a Rent-A-Center Bogart: rough look, but without Bogey's range or timing. He spends the movie going back and forth from stiff anger to angry stoicism, and whenever the script tries to twist some romantic sparks between itself and Windsor, just laugh. The crabbed lumpy face is not a good remedy for tenderness. The spectacle is not entirely without profit, even though it makes some odd choices. At the beginning of the first action, one needs to spend several moments where the hero decides to bring the mandatory clever young boy and monkey mascot, but then ignore them essentially until *** SPOILER ***, the monkey gets on somehow a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally throws near Windsor. Cameron can prove his bravery by diving into it and saving his life at his own expense. *** END SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this movie (as I understand, ran better than 2 1/2 hours) could have given the baby and the monkey more to do. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes the movie show its age ** SPOILER ** is the question of wool mother nuts (the plot unit that puts safari in motion at first). When they are finally seen, it is quite clear that the "mammoths" (of course elephants draped in shag carpets) do not really "attack" anyone, or even move so fast, yet Cameron immediately tries to dry them out with hand grenades. These days, the idea of ​​destroying the last known examples of a species considered extinct will be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a good pace. *** END OF SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> So IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (usually Lippert hack jobs at best have two or three stars). It's not a train wreck of a movie or anything; plus it seems to be good with Rajah's daughter, who argues for the improvement of the most repressive aspect of the "traditional ways" and the elements of "mixed race" romance, which was quite progressive in 1952. And there are some beautiful scenes and exotic plays . See it if anyone offers to show it to you for free, but don't expect much except for an interesting historical chapter of the early fantasy cinema.
