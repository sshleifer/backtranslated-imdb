When I was 13 or so I was lucky enough to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish series of genuine cheesy things. However, this was the cheese cheese I ever owned - but I think I sold it, too bad. Well, what are you going to write ... Better than "Manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it's definitely half an hour and a half since it was made by people who wanted to do it. The play is not so terrible in relation to several other eighties scrap - in fact I am like the old man, even though he did not see the Indian to me. But I don't think you can have everything ... Do yourself a favor and look it up ...
