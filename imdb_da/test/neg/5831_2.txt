Everybody for a while brings 4kids new shows to his business. The last few years they have brought pure gold like Kirby: Right back on Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But again, 4kids have been turned off. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to write a negative comment without bashing the show, but in reality Weekender is pure waste. It is a group that has an overactive brain. The prisoner, however, is something he thinks comes bad. It may sound good on paper, but after seeing it, you will realize how far from good this show is. <br /> <br /> Pizza Guy is an extremely stupid character. He is very one-dimensional, there really is not much for him. He is hyperactive, the end of the story. Although many feel the whole character is a rip off of South Park, I think the opposite. Mechazawa from cromartie High-School is an interesting character and he is able to make me laugh. Tino fails to do either. <br /> <br /> The show's cast is no better. As Tino's mother, they suffer from a lack of character. They only hold one characteristic and that is it. The only redeeming quality is that the show can make you smirk. Whether it's the scene can actually be fun, or you can just grumble because how stupid it is. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very crappy Disney / 4kids show. Although it seems to love some fans, it should really be left to the kids.
