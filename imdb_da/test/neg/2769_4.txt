As a young lass, beautiful Joan Woodbury (like Rita Adams) became orphans after her "feces pigeon" was shot to death. As a young woman, Mrs Woodbury finds herself struggling to hold a job, as her murdered father's former prison status makes Woodbury a bad business risk. Woodbury Rooms with Understanding Singers Linda Ware (like Donna Andrews) who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanages John Archer (like Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (like Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam that lands her in jail. At the release, Woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a race for their money ?? <br /> <br /> Re-titled "Gangs, Inc.", this is a naturally weak, cheap mobster melodrama. Still, watching Woodbury wonders with subordinate material is a lot of fun. She plays the innocent growing more sophisticated "Rita" completely convincing; and she throws in a big bit like a blonde hooker. Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses from the past. "Paper Bullets" also includes an early Alan Ladd (like Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan). Ms Ware, who sang "An Apple for the Teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings a couple of fair '40s nicely. But mostly it is Woodbury's show. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
