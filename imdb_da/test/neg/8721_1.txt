Dune miniseries are opened with a flashforward assembly of action sequences. The realization soon begins that these are the * best * scenes out of 265 minutes of playing time and they are not good. Not good at all. Oh God. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge a book by its cover (though that's exactly what we're invited to do). Let's give Dune a chance to solve itself. <br /> <br /> Well, here's the expected watery opening on Caladan. But who is this petulant, oddly ugly man? Paul Atreides? * This * is Paul Atreides? This generic plastic doll? And why does he look so old? What is it? The actor is only 25? He does not look good, and it is far too old anyway. But at least he has charisma, doesn't he? Wrong. Alec Newman is a stumbling, mumbling buffoon. I imagine him being discovered to be in the dark in a corrective action class because no one liked him enough to tell him that the class was over, and he's just too stupid to realize it. When your Paul Atreides has the entire screen prescreen of soggy toast and a play from "petulant" to "blank" your production of Dune is judged from the start. The other actors are unhappy with poor Alec, though, and give consistent incomplete and incomprehensible beliefs so he doesn't look too bad in comparison. At least I suppose * that's what they're doing. Because I'm charitable, you see. <br /> <br /> To be fair, they get no direction at all. Random gestures, glossy or inconsistent supplies, missing their characters, that's all here. It's like a master class in how not to do it. <br /> <br /> There are more elements in the book in these miniseries than in the 1984 movie, but there are not twice as many because of all of them. Breaks. To fill. Time. <br /> <br /> However, we can forgive all this because of the $ 20 million small budget or just $ 5 million per budget. Hour. No one could be expected to do quality science fiction on that kind of budget. Except for maybe "Stargate SG-1" which makes with $ 1.4 million per. 50 minute episode or "Farscape" at $ 2 million. And frankly, I'd rather see four episodes of one of them while they are stopped in the kidneys than sitting on the travesty that is Dune the Miniseries again.
