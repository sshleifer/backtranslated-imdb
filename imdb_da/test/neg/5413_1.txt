Wow, where to start with this one. Well, if you enjoy laughing at the big mistakes in filmmakers, then this is for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I never pass an opportunity to laugh at B-movie god Casper Van Dien's blunders, and boy was this one of them. It may have been enough that this movie contains the most lame movie monster ever. This thing, which should be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your porch on Halloween. He knocks a robe that is clearly a garbage can, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped helmet over his head. At some points, this is a man in costume, in others it is clearly a plastic plate placed on top of a horse. This monster has the eerie ability to look with "predators" vision, a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after throwing its spear. Sometimes the bar blockers people, sometimes it does not. This thing also manages to bring down a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, it gives a great feeling as when the child jumps up with a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "Critters." This creature is impenetrable to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his killing spree, which we never really know why he is on, he is blown up. This is a fantastic experience because we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the movie. But I suppose this last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> And I don't even get started on the lameness of the other characters. First of all, which Delta Force unit employs women? Last I checked the military still poses women in combat situations. This device is also "undercover". Why? What possible reason would they be undercover? And they aren't even good at it, I don't think no one would realize they were military if they didn't wear uniforms, but they were all load-bearing machines (which, incidentally, change sound effects throughout the movie at some points like air rifle BB guns, and with other guns). There is a lot when the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers from a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pillow they fall on. At another time. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. They tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of a slope, but he clearly chews in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. So when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat and when it shows the woman at the top of the "hill", the rope goes up from its grip, not how it would look if she pulled someone up a hill . Rooker actually has a line that says, "I don't go after him, I go after it." What? It's probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I see these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in writing / producing this movie thought it was so bad. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, it is good. <br /> <br /> The play, bad. Make up, really bad. These signs had either scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. Maybe it's alien scar that likes to run around on your face. Yes, I think I will make a movie about it, "Attack of the Alien Scars that moves around on your face." The villain would be more scary than the Skeleton Man, and the movie would probably be scary.
