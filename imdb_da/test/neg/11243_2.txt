When this show started, it was quite interesting: we got to see what the crab boat fisherman had to go through in the crab catch period. But gradually it lost focus on fishing and focused almost exclusively on the drama of the fisherman's life. Episodes were no more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (it happens all too often), 'someone is hurt or sick', 'a fisherman gets some problem at home and is frustrated that he's stuck on a boat' , repeat. I don't know how people can find the latest seasons that can be seen, as each episode seems to be pretty much the same as before and after it. This show has to be moved to another channel and renamed "Crab Boat Drama", or better yet, it would have made a perfect one-time segment on Dirtiest Jobs. <br /> <br /> Shouldn't the Discovery Channel have learned their lesson for American Choppers?
