A little while ago I encountered this DVD while I was watching Netflix, and with such an impressive cast I decided to give it a head start. Never before have I seen a movie, try to be a new version of an existing big movie (Scarface) and not so spectacular. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what history should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "bad guy". His spectacular rise and decline was not sad, it was a great (and only logical end) to someone who lived such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as director, writer, and lead actor, sees Kilo as a kind of hero, or at least a complicated guy. But he will not do the shallow work of creating a realistic, sympathetic character. He was raised by a white mother, except for his childhood six months, when his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. For reasons that have never been fully explained or even really mentioned, he decides he will be a drug dealer and actually goes to the bad part of town, approaches two dealers and says, "Hi, I'd like to buy some drugs." He drops his father's name, and they seem to be no time, they are not only rich, the two guys who deliver him seem strange to him for reasons, again, never explained. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to jail when a police officer lies about him. But since he has dealt with large amounts of drugs before, why should you feel sympathy for him in prison for this time? The most obvious case that Chapa wants to be the good guy is in his imprisonment of a White Supremacist / rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in the prison because he is about to raise, that's done, he goes on. But in this case, the skimmers must make Busey not only a rape / pedophile, but also a white supremacist. A little overkill, don't you think? I will not go into detail in this regard for much more, but their desperate message of "EVER AS ME! ​​I am a complicated TIME!" fails at all levels. Try as they might, I didn't feel bad, conflictless or sympathetic when his friends were killed (after a shootout), his wife was also killed (shortly after, she called him out to be a miserable father and in an attempt to escape then He decided it would be okay to drive right next to a car filled with guns while his wife is in the car and his possible death. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that his acting can be quite summed up as miserable, his only achievement bringing the concept of "tree" to stealing new heights. Busey had to be credited for actually taking action in his ridiculous role. Little Lists did well. Stacy Keach plays his warden from Prison Break's role. Robert Wagner throws a pay slip. Faye Dunaway, while a dramatic drama, is getting better in performance than this movie deserved. Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give the movie credit it once made Scarface in a way - Jennifer Tilly has the title "Most Ridiculous Attempt on a Hispanic Accent." (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a bad story arc, unsympathetic characters and hit-or-miss appearances. I would advise Mr Chapa to look up the forced sympathy next time - really, we don't need to like your character, we just need to be interested. Better luck next time.
