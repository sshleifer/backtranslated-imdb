OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good, so it was hope for this movie, plus with the casting I was sure it couldn't be less than a 6 in my books. But I got annoyed half an hour in the story ... just as normal movies get good, this movie hit the bottom. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The guy who's all trying to help is so worried that other people are hurting in the middle of the hustle and bustle that he turns on his colleagues to rescue a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armored trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to get other people's attention, thereby ending up endangering more people and long history short. The result is that he is responsible for not only trampling death, but also a police officer being shot and kidnapped by his younger brother ... oh and all 5 of his colleagues die of sham deaths. <br /> <br /> But in the end, he is happy because he came to his senses halfway through the efforts, so what if all his colleagues are now dead instead of sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This movie tried to be so politically correct, it makes me sick! Ruined a good story. Shame really.
