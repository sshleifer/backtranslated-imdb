Your idol will deceive you into this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young German student still bending under his father's orders, even though the actor obviously looks close to 40 years old. This makes his relationship (a collection of collection scenes, basically) to a very young girl who is more disturbing. The character has no dimension, and the war images only serve as a background for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, one of the daytime television's best performers, shows no passion for what should be the greatest interest in this movie: see that he has sex again and again with this girl. It's like seeing two animals on it. If you're a fan of this actor talent in other projects, don't hire this, because you'll never see him the same way. If, on the other hand, you want to see Stephen Nichols having an orgasm in front of the camera, you may like it: Stephen will show you his naked butt, lots of heavy work, his groaning range, but not his talent like this character, of course, just as sex drive and misjudge as he was to want to do such personal things in front of the camera. He may have found it kinky, but I didn't - a big deception!
