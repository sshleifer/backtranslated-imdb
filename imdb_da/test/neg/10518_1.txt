There are some amazing Canadian movies. There are some crappy ones. Last night I looked at one of those crazy ones. It wasn't the typical Canadian movie where it tried to be so different by being artistic. This movie was trying to be a kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was awful. <br /> <br /> From the start, I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie. It had some of the cheesiest dialouge a movie might have. There was this voice over to a scene and it never came back. It always bends me when filmmakers just use voice over when they can't think of another creative way of telling a story. I know being in the Canadian movie industry, I should support my fellow brothers, but this movie is junk. The principle is something like a Soprano episode that is not realistic. Some banker's mafia chief father is on his dead bed and orders his son to make the business legit. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they just take the fact that they will soon be out of work as nothing. To make it legitimate they use extortion. Irony. But not the good kind. Then a freak show girl who had a horrible Elvis wig and birthmark covering half of her face was robbed of the protagonist and a little rape him. Anyways, this guy for some reason likes to dress like girls. Then this banker hangs with a hooker when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls for the hooker because the hooker dresses like a man and puts make-up on him. She is chanting him with some pictures of him wearing bra and panties. Still, he still loves her. He also has no reason to leave his fiancee, but he does to be with the hooker. For a film about organized crime and sexual fetish, there was no action or sex. It was like a late night Cinemax porn movie without the good stuff. There would be sex scenes were not hot or sexy. It was too amateurish. The movie had nothing to do with it, just the lame plot. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was the actor's fault. I think they had a terrible script to work with. What looked the most was the ridiculous characters. The bad guy's name was unclebunny or something. But the name was not important. It was they all were clich√©s. The dialogue was ridiculous throughout the film, and the film's film actors laughed a lot at some of the movie's "serious" moments. So the worst of it all. It had to be the cheapest end. If you ever remember playing shoot out like a child with either imaginary weapons or toy guns. It was pretty much the end of the movie. But I was more than happy, it ended, and I had to warn my fellow-fellows not to waste time or money watching this movie.
