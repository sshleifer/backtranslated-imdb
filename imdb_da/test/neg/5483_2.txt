The comments already sent to this show are much more fun than the show itself, and they are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way that I am very disappointed with how far Rick Mercer has fallen, when he used to do some really good things this hour, has 22 minutes, but now he just complains, goes places and talks for people. He does some things in the studio about things going on in the news, but they are not funny at all, just really boring and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his show is that he goes somewhere to talk to people, for example this week he goes to a rodeo, and the video tapes are all that make funny faces and act scared of the wild horses, etc. He used to Be fun but have got much less fun as they leave this hour having 22 minutes and it also shows no more fun. Now, Air Farce is out of the air (finally thank goodness!) Mercer and this hour, 22 minutes have to be next in line for the ax, just old tired predictable comedy that almost no one finds fun anymore. It's boring, really considering Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian television!
