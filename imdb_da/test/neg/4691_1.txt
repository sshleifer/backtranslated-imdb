Not many people remember "The Carey Treatment" and I can't say I'm blaming them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (ie between "Pink Panther" films.) And for a story about a doctor being detective (Coburn) is working to solve a murder of his Hospital, it is actually pretty forgettable. <br /> <br /> Coburn is reliable as always, and O'Neill is beautiful as always, but there just seems to be something missing in the case. The story twists are not much involved, and even the climax, which must be nerve-wracking, is boyhood instead. <br /> <br /> A missed option at all, and an unfortunate one, as it was based on a Michael Crichton book. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Crichton didn't write a successor to it. <br /> <br /> A star. "Carey" on, Coburn.
