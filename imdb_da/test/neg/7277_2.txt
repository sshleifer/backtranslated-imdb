The hills have eyes are not a good movie in any way of the imagination. For one, the villain looks almost normal, not what you would expect that crooked lunatics should look like. For another, pacing is very slow at times, and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves. This means that there is a lot of filler in the film, with a lot of running around aimlessly. The film did not have a clear direction. The movie's plot is hardly original, even for its time. The Texas chain saw massacre came out a few years earlier and is a much more effective movie as far as horror goes. The movie has been in the way of scare, and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grille and distracting all at once. I suppose the music was used to cover the fact that much of the film is not happening much, even though it failed in the intended purpose. I kept looking at the time every few seconds, hoping something would happen or it would end. When something finally happened, the film had been destroyed by pure chaos and loud sound. I sat through it because I like to give a movie the benefits of doubt. Yes, there is something loud screaming, and yes people die, but who cares. Too slowly get to any kind of pay if you can call it my companion to have it, so at least one of us has something out of it. The trays have eyes are not the worst movie we could have seen, but I doubt I will see it again. This movie was restored in 2006 and I will also get a review of that version. Nevertheless, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times were chaotic and repetitive. Whether you like to see paint dry, occasionally interspersed with someone running around in your block, screaming their head away, stay away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas chainsaw massacre (1973) 1.5 * out of 10 * which is generous
