This movie is a disgrace. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories from time to time and make it a kind of half-finished love story. The whole start of the film was not in H.G. Wells story and didn't have to be. Eloi was also completely wrong. They built houses or formed any kind of real community. They didn't care about each other at all. It was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world that was without adversity or complex feelings. They were hardly aware of Morlocks. I do not know why this movie was done as it was, but some stories should be told as they are or are alone.
