This is movie is garbage, it looked really fun on the previews, but I didn't even laugh through the whole movie. Do yourself a great favor and do not waste your money on this, do not save any money on this. I gave it a 1/10 believe me, I would have given it less if I could. I am a 15 year old guy and I thought it was the trash if you want to watch a good movie go out and see Jay and Silent Bob strike back.
