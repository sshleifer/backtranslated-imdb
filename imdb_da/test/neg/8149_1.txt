With the little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this movie was horrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of direction and production value clearly lacked quite a lot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good grin and then wastes two hours in their life that is a really painful experience. I am surprised that I found this movie myself on the $ 1 DVD rack where it was appropriately located. Maybe I thought it would be good, and maybe I could find some amazing independent movies - I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie. My 3 year old cousin couldn't make a worse movie. I'm glad I saw the movie because I can finally tell people I've seen the worst movie ever made, and be sure of it.
