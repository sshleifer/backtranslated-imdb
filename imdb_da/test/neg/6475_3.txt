Chris Ricci sleep wanders his way through most of this, but quickly takes a bored of boredom and contempt - much as I did when I saw it. Without her, it would not be more than a cheap children's movie, but at least she added an air of quality. There are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the industry. There is not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap Disney recovery aimed at very unpleasant children. I could see Ricci all day so I'm probably unaware of many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you're also a Ricci fan, a cat lover or very young child, I doubt you find this very entertaining.
