Well to each one of their own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most fearful reproduction I had ever witnessed ... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag and inspired by a telemarketing call. The only reason I saw the movie through to the end was that I was hoping it would either be better or be inadvertently fun. No luck. <br /> <br /> No respect for the support game or Zefferelli's division, but nothing can make up for the protagonist's bungling. I have seen Hamlet well portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a hardcore warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. But IMHO this depiction was just a plentiful lack of joke with most weak hams.
