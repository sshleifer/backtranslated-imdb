Have you found the title fun? Oh, didn't you? Well that's because you're close. Learn to laugh because if you don't laugh, you don't live. So, please lower your standards as to what you think is fun for just an infant. Now you find it fun? Still no ?! Okay, it's because you're full of yourself and get offended too easily. If you don't laugh, you don't live. And if you don't like me then send me hate mail so I could write a new review and indicate how much hate mail I get and try to twist it to make it seem like I'm a bad ass. Are you laughing at my fun title yet? Still no?!?! OK that's it! You're a racist! You must laugh, otherwise you are racist. Why else would you not laugh? Oh, it's not fun!?! No, it can't be why. I want to have fun, so that's it !! Laugh it! Please!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, that's it. Where's my notepad and pen? And where are my Richard Pryor DVD's? I'll write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thank you thank you. <br /> <br /> This is basically what you get from Mencia for approx. 23 minutes. Please do yourself a favor and change the channel when this pimple's show comes on. Even basic cable channels have things 100x better than this. I'm not even saying this because I hate him. I'm too real. This show is like watching grass grow. Not sure though, at least grass does not steal jokes. I honestly try to save your time. I even tried to see his show. I told myself "maybe he's not that bad". But no, he is. I was completely out when I saw his show. I tried to gather myself during the commercial break and focus on the show, but I couldn't. I healthy again, I think I was thinking of something more interesting like restoring my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Here's my final thought - There are so many things you can do with 30 minutes beyond watching this guy shout for nothing in half an hour. Don't see a show trying to reject racism in your face in vain. I can support shows that try to ease the tension during the wars, but this guy just gives more racism than stopping it.
