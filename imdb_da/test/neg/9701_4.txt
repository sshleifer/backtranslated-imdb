Let me start by saying that I love the book and loved the A&E miniseries. I was hoping to love this movie and I was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and shortening the actual story. However, this film hardly resembles the original book. If only the "names had been changed to protect the innocent," I might have enjoyed the movie as just an entertaining if it was inaccurate, for a while. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name "Mr. Darcy" puts on a character that is emotional and weak, giving the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a ruthless, snippy, often teary eyed height that cares nothing for society's rules and make "Mr. Bingley" a wide-eyed dimwit completely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read Jane Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> There are some really amazing moments in this movie - maybe a total of 10 minutes is really excellent. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr Collins' proposal begins beautifully. She is 27 years old (very close to the hopeless spinster age of these times), she becomes a burden to her family, and she is not romantic. She only wants "a comfortable home." But the beautiful dialogue is destroyed when she blubbers: "Don't judge me, Elizabeth. You dare not judge me!" and run off in tears. Later you see Charlotte Kowtow to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who was not in her character at all as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good moment is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in her home while she walks the area with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in the A&E series, but the movie version with Keira Knightley made the audience feel acute, how much humiliating the moment might have been for Elizabeth. Very nice. The ending also showed a level of love between Elizabeth and Darcy, which was not shown as evident in the miniseries. I actually appreciated that scene, simply because I like to see a happy end, rather than just knowing it took place. <br /> All in all, this film eliminated the subtlety that was so integrated into Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The characters speak in a collapsing combination of Austen's dialogue word-writing and modern sentences and colloquialisms. Information referred to or suggested only in the original work is clearly indicated in this version. Yes, time was worrying. It's just a short movie, yada yada. But transforming a complex, beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some have commented that they loved the moment Darcy first saw Elizabeth because it apparently is a case of "love at first sight". Love at first sight? Huh? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth should not be a traditional beauty, and Darcy will love her for her joke and liveliness ... he literally loves "her to her." <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first suggestion) when the two shouted furiously at each other as they lean closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly separate. Ugh! What a sad clich√©. They are angry and inhibited by each other, but so attracted that it does not matter that they do not even look like each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like another story. Mr. The bennet was dour, Elizabeth usually seemed as stupid as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintentional and desperate for her own home - unlike the intelligent, slightly disgraceful woman with an abundance of common sense portrayed in the short story . Jane and Elizabeth's relationship is just current, instead of the deeply rooted love and admiration they should have for each other. <br /> <br /> All this I could have accepted as just bad interpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept everything beyond the many many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley went around barely dressed (her dress looked like the others would wear as tight underwear). Elizabeth went to Netherfield with her hair down and was allowed to fly everywhere. The family lazed in one morning, even though morning had to be reserved to call acquaintances (or be called in your own home). Elizabeth went barefoot outside in her nightgown. And in a really horrible scene, Bingley entered Jane's bedroom and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was ill. <br /> <br /> Most people would feel that these are minor points, but I simply wanted either A.) a historically accurate movie or B.) an accurate representation of the letters in the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / person who sacrificed accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a thin story of love at first sight. I can admit that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the day, like this movie very easily, and there is nothing wrong with it. I simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a movie that involved more than just two beautiful faces.
