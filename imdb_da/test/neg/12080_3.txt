<br /> <br /> This movie was produced and released as a sequel to a horrible - though rather popular - slapstick California beach comedy called Hardbodies, but it has little or no connection with the previous movie and is better judged completely in its own right . It is definitely better than Hardbodies I, and is more closely associated with films like Venus and Summer Lovers, which were also filmed in the summer on the Greek islands. The combination of blissful beaches on blue coves with beautiful bare bushings provides seductive viewing, but (except for travel plans just designed to help plan your next vacation), even such movies require an appropriate story to keep viewers pay attention to more than a few minutes. Venus was supported by the legend of goddess reincarnation, and summer lovers had the viability of a "menage a trois" theme. In my opinion, both of these films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very fuzzy history and depends too much on a simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. The use of slapstick quickly becomes boring, it usually leads to a number of very short independent cameo sequences that are difficult to integrate into a current story line. Mel Brooks has achieved this excellent with Silent Movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and unfortunately Hardbodies II does. There is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not coincide with the idyllic and peaceful scenario where the movie is set. The final airport sequences were undoubtedly intended to give a hilarious end to this movie, but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo-comedy. They are also roughly elongated, so I left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth. This is a movie that could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences severely cropped. As it was released, it certainly does not guarantee a viewer rating higher than 3. <br /> <br /> There is a little memorable in the play, but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a weak story and bad direction - It is in these latter areas that the error occurs. <br /> <br />
