An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the movie she throws back the "stableback" to be too young before he goes out for the driver! The high tinted English set she moves in is such a clich√©d bunch of harummps that it is ridiculous. But tops are Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! "My violin! How do I ever enjoy eating again!" "Patreecia, my milk is cold!" It is campy beyond belief.
