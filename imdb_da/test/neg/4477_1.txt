I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded so funny. The idea of ​​making a cheesy 50's monster movie could have been worth a laugh, but instead this title only teases. First, there is almost no Froggg in the whole movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit through 75+ minute lame drama and dialogue to get a few glimpse of Froggg humping a harsh chick. Why? In addition, the film lacks any kind of fun plot. I mean giving me something that is a little more interesting than just a bunch of speaker heads. I wanted to see some hot chicks searching for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cute slings knocked out to his lair in desperate need of rescue (Creature from the Black Lagoon stuff), I wanted to see a couple of action scenes of Froggg continues to kill spree, or it may avoid a silly trap. Something exciting! Geez, have fun with it, be creative! Who will sit through endless and tiring dialogue scenes in a wildness? My advice for the filmmakers: Continue, your concepts are good, but your execution must be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most importantly ... put more creativity in a creature movie !!!
