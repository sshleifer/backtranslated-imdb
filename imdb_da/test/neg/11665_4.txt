This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense movie than what I hoped it was .... just a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were exciting, but part of the previous 75 was just boring. Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued and did not play his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sports a bit of a stupid look most of the time, and her character was very unappealing. <br /> <br /> The story is uneven. It's not as bad as I do, but it's probably not something I wanted to see again, and the back of VHS describing this movie was misleading.
