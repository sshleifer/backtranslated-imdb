Wow ... that's the kind of movie that makes you wonder how it was, and what soup kitchen they eat now. Saying this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide, I figured it would be a spoof ... maybe it should have been. Could have made a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene where they are in an airplane in the middle of the flight with the door open and there is no wind whats ever. They could have jumped to a fan at least. <br /> <br /> Look for more Canadian and c-list actors in the movie. This is the kind of movie that collides with the b-rate cable stations you never see except on a rainy Sunday.
