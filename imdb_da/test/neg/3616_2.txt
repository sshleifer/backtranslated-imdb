I really don't think I'm writing a review on a movie titled "Secret Snake Island", but even in the abstract framework of its own genre, this hit a new layer so my anger must be known. The only reason I even bothered to watch this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it would be bad, it was really late at night, I couldn't sleep, and in the past really bad movies would drain energy out of me and make me long to sleep. It soon became very early that this movie was going to be horrible, but it even shut down the expectations. The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the African River, ending up striving for his team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes down to pick them up. They hang out, become full and become so exposed to poisonous snakes on mission to cleanse their island people. <br /> <br /> If your jaw fell into the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother to read it, you got it right the first time. Frankly, I prefer my creative function when the being (s) only attack the obscene stupid people out of hunger, not because they have any kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not giants like what you see in "Anaconda." They are just ordinary, everyday African snakes like mambas and vipers? Only they have the brain to form armies, record causes, work together to catch people, understand our language and even dance! Did your move fall again? Well, it's going to fall further. The amount halfway through this horrible B movie, about the part I had already given up, begins the human characters to drink around in a campfire and then suddenly they break into some sort of orgy. And while they dance naked and then, the snakes snake completely and stop with it. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes, some of the most rogue creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against humans for some sense of misfortune proved too much for my bad brain. And just as I even though the filmmakers couldn't take it to an even lower level, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> The people of the movie? Well, let's just say I've never rooted the creatures to kill everyone so fast. I just couldn't stand anymore. <br /> <br /> I really don't think I should continue; you get the picture. If there is something that makes "Snake Island" different from its other rivals, then it dares to try to be even more stupid, and it is not a free achievement. Why? Just why? I continue to submit myself to these really bad movies, I think I never really know about it. But "Snake Island" hits a whole new low. It's an inexpensive, scary excuse for a movie that "Anaconda", a brainless snake movie, looks so brilliant and sophisticated and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws". You have been warned.
