The problem with this kind of lyrical film production is that you either make a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little middle ground. Be careful, this is not "Berlin - Symphony of a City" or "Man with a Film Camera". Unfortunately, it is not much to look at either. <br /> <br /> The problem with this is that it is slippery and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had boarded. It doesn't really have anything to say, or rather to show us pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propagate a dissertation. This is just a patchwork hunt for a point. (Though the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than it intends, there's something deeply paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilization, anti-media film that is so deeply bred with technology. Do as I say, and not just as I do. "Just love Yanks, eh. Tonally, there is something sour and misanthropic about this episode. Both previous episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration; this time the tone is consistently glum. of this duration, which Gustav Mahler will tell you. <br /> <br /> Stylishly, Naqoyqatsi is a mess. "The character of the analogue" found recording ". (I mean, I'm annoyed by the boys. Part of Koyanisqaatsi's joy was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film. But now optical film is a historical artifact, they "take on board" it digital domain, but I don't think they bring it out. The digital stuff often resembles video connections from CNN or BBC World.) And with the "found recording", yes, digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just stupid and the false color and solarization keep me thinking of ... <br /> <br /> ... ahem ... James Bond title sequences. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strange as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the film has been stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; It's about as discreet as a Lawrence Olivier voice-over. The images must be very convincing in order to oppose all the charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass himself is in odd shape; Never expected him to turn off Verdi requiem! (Let me laugh, which of course is not the desired answer to any part of this movie). There is even a piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they've changed their pills. <br /> <br /> From our 'inactive question' section: is Geoffrey Reggio actually a Hopi Indian? Or did he just make a sweat lodge in the Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are the various excerpts of recordings from past 'episodes' in the trilogy a comment on the way these movies are also part of the global media slushy?
