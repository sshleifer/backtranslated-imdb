Patsy Kensit and some random Australian block stars as a duo of wannabe hard coppers in the middle of investigating a number of art galleries related murders, but in between, they still find time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of male policeman. be testimony. The serial killer is suddenly no more important when the wife, who is believed to be a wife (who is basically just a colleague for her), is found murdered, and male policeman becomes the main suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really boring, unreliable and thrill-free Aussie thriller that obviously mimics popular sex thrillers such as "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional, and virtually every good-cop / bad-cop-clich√© is described in the description in the script. The police's fighting position in a corps full of men, shot-first-issue-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc. Even the unhealthy eating habits of the police is an ongoing gag. Yawn! Kensit really tries his best to make this movie more tolerable, but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real movie hero. End twist is more or less interesting (not at all original, imagine), but then you stopped worrying about the characters for a long time. The scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ridiculously fake, and Clive Fleury's directing is completely uninspired. What a total waste of time ??
