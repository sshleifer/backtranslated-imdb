In the real world of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy drama queen that every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up next door. Her screen shot, Christina Ricci, is the ugly artsy wannabe girl who desperately wants everybody, but no guy wants to touch her. That is why, in Prozac Nation, the unpublished 2001 film by Wurtzel's 1990 bestseller book of the same name, there are immediate issues. OK, the problems start before Ricci's miscarriage, which has the emotional range of a timble - is it weird that by far the finest play she had in the two Addams Family movies? First and foremost, she is bizarre in appearance - with big eyes and a bulging forehead that makes her look like the 2001 star: A Space Odyssey. Second, she always plays whiney brats. But thirdly, the way the movies are trying to make it seem that every guy will be attracted to her. In a scene in the movie, her friend Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz go through Harvard, and all the boys' tongues are waiting for Ricci, not the super cute and sexy Williams. Hi ??. Reality check time ??. This material asked for the Andy Warhol treatment. Here is his version of the movie. A five minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five minute shot of Wurtzel's tough pudenda. A five minute shot of her sleeping naked and rocky on the bed. She gets up, gives the middle finger to the audience. Cue credits. See less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel all his life. And Oh Oh, Warhol's movie wouldn't have cast Ricci. Even though Michelle Williams would have been better, and having seen Ricci's wise bosom, I would take whatever Williams or any other child would offer me cinematically. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a movie and how she keeps working is a mystery. Think of her mediocre performances for bad movies such as Monster, Sleepy Hollow and Woody Allen's - also contributing to Jason Biggs, and now another actress's role in her role, and the movies could immediately seem better, if not great. She is the female counterpart to banal, wood, milquetoast actors like Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
