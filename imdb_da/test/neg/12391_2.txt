It seems at least vague that this movie gave some inspiration to "The Sopranos". As a protagonist, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many problems from his past and his profession that he is in therapy trying to handle it all. Everything finally comes to mind at his 10-year high school association. The problem was that when I came to the reunion, I had stopped breaking. Frankly, I found this movie a move from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It had potential. There was a pretty good throw under the leadership of Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, who played Grocer, his arch rival in the hit man's business with Minnie Driver like Debi, Blank's high school treasure, whom he stood up on prom night and a limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. The pretty talented never threw really well together. Drama lacked intensity, and the comedy lacked real humor. What I thought had the greatest potential for being a comic story was the merchant's suggestion for a hit man's association, but apart from being a bit of a regular joke, the idea was never really developed. With regard to romance, one wondered why Debi would think of letting this guy come back in his life. <br /> <br /> There were a handful of chuckles, but nothing really got me and kept me and I spent most of the movie wondering if this thing will ever start clicking. It never did - at least not for me. 2.10
