Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away (soundproofed), water has become the most valuable item (this should sound good), and a small minority controls its distribution (what a surprise you just have a heart attack and die of that surprise) . A group of ispirates (rainforest ??? wet bandits? ... Oh wait, the last one has been used) Try to discover the route to a fabulous unlimited water supply with a nice but spoiled (Druish?) Princess and tow and a group of idiots 锟拷 t is honorable villain in persecution. <br /> <br /> This movie has the potential to be a great comic parody ("Star Wars", David Lynch's "Dune"), but was just not handled properly. It goes on, I think the term is "low brow" humor. It's not really that fun, it's a shame as it has Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence the three stars) who don't even get into the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rental and definitely have a drink right up.
