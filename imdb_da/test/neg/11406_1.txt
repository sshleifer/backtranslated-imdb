Demon Wind is just as fun as breaking your legs. It is certainly a terrible example of a movie. So terrible that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as one thing ... a monstrous thing. One thing to stop at any cost. My friends and I first discovered this ... stuff buried under a big box of videotapes at my friend's house. It was a late night, and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we have unfortunately chosen this one.) During the 90 minutes that this thing played, we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The case is literally meaningless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap, poorly finished rip-off of the Evil Dead. The whole "story" seems to be more than a guy who wants to knock his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and tearing demons. I have a bet that the authors actually wrote the story while it was filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (shudder) I have to say that Demon Wind could certainly struggle with all those movies on the terms of sheer stupidity. Just watch it if you enjoy laughing with silly movies. <br /> <br /> Fun Fact: This movie is like a cockroach on steroids! Much like the ouija table every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to be mysterious again. Kind of scary huh?
