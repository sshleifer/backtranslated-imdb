I originally started on the paranormal state because I (more or less) find the paranormal search engine to be interesting TV, if not otherwise. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy Ghost Hunters because well over half of their research results in total debunking, and find Most Haunted to be fun with their use of media and frumpy British women with Paris Hilton today. eyes fainting from fear / demonic performance all shot in nice night vision green. The paranormal state has none of this appeal. It feels like it was cobbled together from "leader" whom Ghost Hunters rejected. The episodes range from trailer Sunday families and single mothers to emo youths who sit and scare themselves to an "interview" with a 5 year old about the monster living in his room (the monster goes RAWRRR, we are told). All of these people are calling for a college club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his huge ego. He leads his troupe of good-natured bored, except when a case is considered too extreme and orders them to stay at the hotel HAHAHA. Better leave it to the pros, that is, to yourself. <br /> <br /> The ignorant comedy of this show is all in how happy the participants are. Ryan spins his stories of being chased, followed, etc. by a demon he first met when the Catholic Church recruited him to help with a case. Sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do it, they don't need the Quiznos day shift manager to chip in his 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is horrible, shame on the A&E for bankrolling this stupidity that tries to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal themes. It's almost unintentional fun, except that Ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma to watch the show long enough to mock it, is not worth the hassle.
