This movie starts with the protagonist who is in a coma in a hospital department, joins two orders. The subconscious protagonist is heard in a voice over and says the order is homosexual. The orders are kissing. I saw this in a DVD version and I suspect this should be fun ?? It said "comedy" on the DVD case, after all, and it goes on. If I had seen this in a movie theater, I would probably have heard part of the audience rowing with laughter because it is so fun and because they have to sit in a comedy. Though it is fascinating to think about what it is fun and what is not, this film unfortunately gives only arguments about what is not. Brilliant brains can do something fun, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proven that fact. But you need to know the "mechanics", I suppose. Director and co-script writer Dani Levy doesn't like these mechanics, he thinks that some things are simply fun, that two orders are gay and kiss over a man in a coma. Don't make me wrong, some people can make fun, Dani Levy can't, not for me, anyway. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is that I can't see a reason behind the way the protagonists behave. I could not understand why the two brothers, an Orthodox Jew from West Germany, a third grade carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from the former East Germany so strongly disliked each other. They are both pretty boring characters. Their children are boring except they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now, but raises the daughter she has with her cousin). But even these incestuous relationships ?? If something they are embarrassing - just came through as an excuse, because the manuscripts couldn't come up with anything better. <br /> <br /> The act is not bad, Udo Semel I actually suffered a lot, even though he reminded me more of President Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction in itself is also not really bad, but perhaps Levy has to stick to controlling movies and leaving the manuscript to another. Now I heard that he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!
