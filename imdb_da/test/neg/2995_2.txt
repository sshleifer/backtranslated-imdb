I should live this movie, but I don't. It won international awards, it's foreign (I usually like such movies) it goes slow (again something I like) and it has no free sex or violence. The problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey a "successful" second. The failed one comes to Istanbul to remain successful in an effort to get a good job at sea. Both living life is unfulfilling, meaningless and petty. <br /> <br /> It's not the first time this kind of movie is made. I didn't see anything new that was added to this tired theme. There are long roofs that are just standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching television. I understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their love, while making the idea the first 15 minutes. I don't have to be beaten over it for the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> Symbolism is also a little heavy handed out. plate of live minnow type fish with one of the plate and flops around in its dead cast. Symbols are best when they are not obvious, but are there in the background creating a mood just under the viewer's consciousness. <br /> <br /> The movie is so apathetic that it doesn't even consider a score of 1, so I gave it a 2. Judging a 1 takes a talent by being bad. This movie didn't have much energy.
