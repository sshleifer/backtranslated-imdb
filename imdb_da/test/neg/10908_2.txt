Another first: this French film is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Maybe I'm a little rushed when I say this is probably my last Rohmer movie, but I was immediately turned off by the way Rohmer trusts monotonous philosophical conversations that never come to that point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I never thought would end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. He struck me to be one of the pitiful, scary people who are filled with hot air. If this is a test of what his movie is about, I'm not interested. I don't care about French cinema (usually reflective and speculative for a mistake), so maybe I'm biased.
