I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll clich√© that wasn't used in this movie. Ouffcourz, rock registry life is just six drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. Say it to stupid young boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too much Guns'nRoses or Motley Crue stories. I have seen everyday ordinary rock band close and there is nothing to do with the reality of this movie. If you succeed, your life is touring touring touring. This means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just slept. Because you need to be healthy, sober and clean in the evening. After live you have some time to discharge your stage experience. Then you have some time to have fun. But it is not a luxury or a dream. Artistically, this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogues. The end of the movie was fun - the main character left heavy metal bands and formed a grunge band! Yes, what morals. Real 90s.
