This movie is bad as we all knew it would be. Most times I usually love the bad 80s / early 90s trash-can comedy (haha no pun intended). I list Ski School, Career Opportunities, Hot Shots, Summer School and many more made around this time. This even has the classic yet forgotten comedy by Dean Cameron (aka .. Ski School ยง 8 Instructor and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just too slow. It takes almost 30 minutes to get started and we have to sit through a meaningless dialogue between that half-wits Sheen boys (E&C). And yes, I can hear the bloggers who die to destroy me with "of course you are not looking at 2 and 1/2 men." Well, Charlie was not at that level he is now under this girl ... not to He is something worth seeing now that Charlie shines only when his co-stars support him, and Emilio is no more than an overused wonder well offering little support. In fact, this movie is written by Emilio and it shows. (came to Emilio himself Ski School 2 writers barefoot one end.) No idea how a problem is solved, no hot babes, no gang to ease the bad plot, signs, action ... I'm tired of this tirade Just save your time and watch the movies I mentioned above, you'll enjoy them much more.
