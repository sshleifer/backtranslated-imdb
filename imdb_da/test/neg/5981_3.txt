What a waste of a big cast. I wanted to check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of relatively well-known actors. It turned out to be a meaningless collection of boring concurrent stories of several characters with minimal relationships with each other. Signs that begin to look like decent people, but do not end up with a single sympathetic or interesting characteristic among them. Calling it a comedy was also a stretch ... The only thing that made me cry was Jack Black's song, which was basically Tenacious D. I was waiting for something big to happen, but ended with nothing more than 97 minutes of mine life wasted.
