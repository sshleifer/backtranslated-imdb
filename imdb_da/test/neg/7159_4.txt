This glorified discovery channel documentary, some biblical study, a treasure hunt, all misused, may well fit into that television origins, but fall flat as a feature film. From the first glance, it is cheesy looking cover art, one can cast doubt on the integrity of this serious topic that appears on the front page, which rejects the search for Jesus' tomb for a generic type of action that looks more National Treasure or Tomb Raider, so anyone informed debate and study of the historical burial ground must. Such is the subordinate way in which the whole matter revolves. <br /> <br /> More curious children, worthy of research, Simcha Jacobovici's explorations come across as self-reliant, while his research crosses as manipulative. For all the fascinating revelations, this filmmaker tries to convey his viewers through presumably evidence, a flood of repetitive statements repeating the same research and achievements over and over, proving that Jesus Lost Tomb has very little information to back up the bloody, if Than entrancing requirements. What this means is a very frustrating attempt to turn the audience over the head with the same little factual evidence to support the authenticity of this grave, which ironically detracts from it. Although many of these mini-coffins, interconnected to support the Jesus of Nazareth theory, merge with each other, this research continues with a rounded approach to continually pursuing the unambiguous occupation of this romanticized archaeologist. There may be some impressive factual data that help shed light on many traditional dogmatic Christian attitudes, but in essence, the shady nature of this project was that it was merely a piece of exploitation funded at a time when Da Vinci The code was all the rage. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cheesy cover art was right. In spite of my appreciation of documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus takes an always interesting topic and transforms it into long-lasting and untouched geriatric adventure hunting, replacing any relevance and holiness for the uninspired motivations behind this team. At the time these excavators have completed their explorations, it is unwilling to stop the research because of social demands, and the viewers are left with the feeling that the director insisted on forging this mystery about whether it was there to begin with. or not. There are a few real powerful moments where the history halls come marching through this documentary in modest ways, but all the decoding, exploration, and theorizing in the world still left this deceived vanity piece in an unpleasant void for apathetic response.
