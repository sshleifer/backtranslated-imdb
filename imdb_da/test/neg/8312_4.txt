There is a point in the movie where the female director of "death machines" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, including I think it's called these days) is talking about using leverage on a businessman. Apart from that, her delivery is that it sounds like "leather". At what time, this viewer looked up to believe that this boring movie turned into a new world of kinkiness. But it didn't. The chief lady had to speak when the "dead machines" did not say a single word throughout the film and she spoke. Product setup. There is action in the movie, but it's not that exciting and the plot staggers from one clich√© to another. The three mute death machines live to survive another day at the end of the movie. Hopefully there wasn't a successor.
