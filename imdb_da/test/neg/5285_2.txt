Possibly one of the best, most horrible b-movies ever, as in it's so bad and random, it's a bit of fun, and I don't know how to feel about it .. reminds me of Cabin Fever .. There is just something about the child jumping out of the porch making karate and shouting 'pancakes' that are exciting. Since many people have already outlined the plot and all I have to do is summarize the quality of the movie with a quote: "I am a park ranger who is about to get started". yes enough to say? If you're looking for quality or a really scary movie, I don't recommend it. But if you like these kind of movies then I think you would enjoy it. I don't know how, but I think some people would.
