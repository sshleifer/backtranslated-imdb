Stay away from this one. The worst thing is the horrible story. There seems to be an intention to convey some subtle spiritual / love / friendship message, but it is so pathetic devoid of any substance you cannot help but cringe. Moreover, the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves, criminals and our hero (s) dealing with some foreign time travel artifacts. I know you are asking for problems when you are in time, but the story is more full of holes than usual. You also have: cheap sets, bad plays and some of the worst music events in the motion picture history, overwhelming, inexpensive, abrupt and incoherent. All I can say is "Man alive! This movie is bad!"
