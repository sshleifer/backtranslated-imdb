Paul Muni and Bette Davis overshadow monstrously, while missing studio hack Archie Mayo seems distracted and unaware of this racist provocative film that fetches its "bittersweet end" by invoking segregationist attitudes. Heavily handmade and poorly constructed, the film collapses in its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an uncontrolled court scene that it never recovers from, since Mr. Muni begins to chew up the landscape at the courtyard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent way. <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American on the other side of the track who, through determination and grit, obtains a law degree from a store front school. In his first major case involving an auto-happiness, he only shows unmanageability and is quickly made to see the dumb of his well-heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends that he be uninhibited. Disturbed by the backlash, an angry Johnny takes a job at a gambling joint where he is witnessed by owner Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette) who likes his style. The owner cuts him into the place, but problems arise with Mrs Roark (Davis) who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, involves Johnny and slowly gets mad before being acquitted and free to be with a high society Wasp, who coldly colds to him that they are from "different tribes, wild" and it will never work. When she flees to escape her anger, she is driven over and killed by a car. Ramirez sells the casino and moves back to its poor neighborhood, rationalizing that it is best to stay alone. <br /> <br /> In addition to this awful degradation, Bordertown has a number of bad notions to compliment the overall horror of history. Unfair as his situation may be, Muni's Ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant, it becomes difficult to show sympathy for such a grave blunder. Davis is no better than the less than loyal wife who matches Muni's same young feelings. Her Lady Macbeth true scenes do not indicate that she was becoming the best movie actress in her era. Margaret Lindsay as Munis American Dream is cold, distant and flat. Bathing like Bordertown is (and much) it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes. The rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction.
