There is so much wrong with this movie. Greico with a girls wig, old man scientist time machine fixer, hard guy Jones who gets behind with a shotgun who has three rounds, Spider people with tentacle hands and bad teeth etc. Makeup was so bad and they had only a few visible spiders on the screen at some point (Aliens Cameron technique could have been used) instead they chose to dress all the spiders in the same way ... bad. The good thing about Greicia's acting is that he bobs his hatred at every syllable as if he were counting on how many words he was allowed to speak in the manuscript. It amazes me that with all the information out there on DVD comments, there are still people making movies. This movie could have been worse how I didn't know it. Oh and one last thing. I'm going on a SCI-FI movie hunting down. The people who run that channel should not be allowed to grow to continue the nepotism that exists in film and television.
