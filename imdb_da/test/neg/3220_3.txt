A few weeks ago, in a movie theater, I saw a movie poster by El Padrino (2004) with the tag "The Latin Godfather". How low have we been, I thought Latin just because he is a Mexican? Let me remind you that something Latin comes from or is related to Latium, Italy. So the original guy in the godfather movie is more Latin than the Mexican godfather, and that's why: We are Latin American people because we speak Spanish, a language based in the Latin language that comes from Rome now Italy. So, to place a tag in a movie poster like "The Latin Godfather", it's not just ignorant, of course, if we try to relate this movie to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get the credit of copying the title of a movie classic. Now about the movie, I just hate overtaking so from 1 to 10 I guess is 3 most.
