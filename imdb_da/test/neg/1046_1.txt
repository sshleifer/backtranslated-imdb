"Five characters in search of an exit" must be one of the most boring "Zones" ever made. It was on Sci-Fi this morning, and as usual I changed the channel. I put it in my top five list of the worst "zones" ever produced. Boring and predictable, and not worth seeing. Serling worked this theme to death (earthmen in foreigners' hands, who were often giants), and in this particular version it just doesn't work. Anyone who hasn't seen it before will quickly find out. This is another Serling philosophical mood piece, perhaps parallel to the situation of those in prisoners of war or concentration camps, where the prisoners may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their prisoners. William Windom, who is the last one to "fall in", is the only curious to make the effort, and it doesn't take long to figure out the result.
