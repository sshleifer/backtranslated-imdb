I've seen some bad action movies in my days, but it's simply awful. I feel it is a waste of time to write this myself, but I will do it briefly. Why does this movie suck? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurish and cut. 2. Poor bad badly acting of the whole cast. 3. Stupid dialogues and too many clich√©s. 4. For many plot holes, many scenes do not add. 5. Poor photography (and many continuity issues). 6. Ridiculously poor performance of the leading female actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not for good either). 8. Even for a Snipe's movie, he shows a great lack of acting material. 9. Outrageous accents (of all the casts). 10. Last but not least - too many incredible facts, such as. A football tournament in the United States, the CIA needs to make background checks to get new information about their employees, a mattress that is explosion-proof and so on. In essence - it's a waste of time, it's not fun, not entertaining, not even like a joke - DON "T WATCH IT !!! Seriously, just don't.
