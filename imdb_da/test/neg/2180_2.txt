This should be Charlie's masterpiece, but I would argue that it is actually one of his weaker films. First of all, it's not fun. Not one thing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump in a box that was a giggle, but it was a desperation. Tramp's first and only talkie where he speaks (he sings in a previous movie), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was so happy to see in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two movies that are at least ten times better than this movie. There is literally only a good scene in this movie, the one where Hitler plays with the globe as a beach ball. That is it. Okay, so it gets a lot of praise for being the first movie to wage war just before we entered the war. Nix. Not true. Simply not true, so praise can be denied a little. The Three Stooges made it on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months earlier than the October release of Chaplin's movie - and that movie was actually fun! If you want to see Chaplin's greatest movie, just look it for reference. And then pop in "Modern Times", "Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Limelight", "The Kid" or even "Tillie's Punctured Romance".
