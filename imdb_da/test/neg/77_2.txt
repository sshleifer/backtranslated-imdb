OK, so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of them, and it gets absurdly praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I caught this on television (unknown, as TV shows all the movies, it's for you Americans who might say that I didn't do it I don't like it because I saw a cut TV version - fortunately it's just an American thing) and had no idea what it was. I lit, caught the last minutes of a show, and the movie began. Within a minute I asked for it to be a comedy when the particularly ridiculous clich√© began (yes, it is a bad movie within the movie, I know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! even know why I did not change channels). And yes, actually, the film turned out to be a comedy, albeit unintentionally. Marina Zudina is pretty enough, but gosh, what a terrible achievement! While throwing a foreigner into the role, you're smart enough (she's not talking so goodbye), yet sorry, Marina baby playing mute doesn't mean you fancy Harpo Marx. Her acting is inadvertently fun for many moments, just look at her as she draws an X in the air while being pulled by the killer. He'll kill you, it's not time to play Zorro. We get lots of "running on top" things that pass for tensions, as in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a blanket and a bad guy shooting the other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Still, I have the best / worst gem that has a guy in a bathtub and ... I've never seen anyone galvanized to death in a bathtub, but I'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life, do you? And what about instantly trusting a peer because he says he's a policeman and doesn't ask him to show you his credentials? OK, so he turns out to be a real policeman. But still, not asking for badge makes no sense (plot-wise, we could always believe that the credentials may be fake, or he may be a curly politician. Write writing 101). And what about the big twist? Don't tell me you're not coming from 200 miles away ... I'm sorry bad old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. Now I think about this, what is the point of giving him a "Mystery Guest Star" credit ... at the end of the titles? The movie is over, there is no mystery anymore, and everyone and their brother have identified Guinness (even non-movie buffers will recognize "the old guy from" Star Wars "). Even better this way so we can let go "It's not the late big actor. People continue to compare this with Hitchcock. I suppose it must be the John Hitchcock milkman, as the late Mr Alfred would feel embarrassed about seeing this, let alone doing it." And this gets a 6.8 / 10 ???? It is bottom 100 material! But then we speak an evaluation system that makes it possible to 'Lord of the Rings: King's Return' appears as the third best film ever made (check Top 100 ), so ... <br /> <br /> 2/10.
