That's how I was when I (staggered) out of this "movie". I couldn't leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I got stuck in the middle. Caught. <br /> <br /> The tiny fragment of original recordings that tried to tie this movie together contains some of the worst acts ever to grace the big screen. The daughter was a sharp execution - stands out in the bad sense. <br /> <br /> Thge cinematography was awesome, with unrestrained framing and some of the strangest lighting I've seen. <br /> <br /> As for stock footage ... well in the first place ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this movie? Why do I recognize its existence? Please don't see it. Do something useful with two hours in your life and go a little dry on paint.
