This film is about a cavity between the real world and the dead. There is a lot of mumbo jumbo about the internet (ie if you install a program on the computer, you see dead people - much like if you are playing a video tape you die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed to be pretty stupid and lost me. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live in their own separate existence - be complete alone for eternity. This was enjoyable and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a large number compared to most Americans. But a genre that has become popular in recent years, which I just can't relate to very well, is these horror movies. I know they are super popular - especially as they seem to be remade so often in the states. I have seen both RINGU and RING, JU-ON and GRUDGE and were rather ambivalent despite their popularity. About the only recent horror movie I really liked from Japan was SEANCE - a recast of the British movie, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what do I think SEANCE did differently? Well, unlike the other films as well as KAIRO, gobs and gobs money was not spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience - instead, the emphasis was on history. The bottom line is that these other movies are much like American movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th - with scary things jumping out to scare the audience and the plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want history - not cheap excitement or ghosts as the film's primary focus. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know I'm in the minority, but I just can't find this is a very satisfying movie. Too often, there are less things that might scare someone a little - but the characters start screaming and crying and acting like saying "this is the scariest movie ever made so you can better start shaking". Well, I think it's just trying too hard, and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the movie and plot progression - not scary tactics.
