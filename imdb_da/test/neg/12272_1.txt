Let's see it, a really horrible movie, no ... I mean a "real" horrible movie, is a rare, strange and beautiful thing to see. I admit that there is a special place in my heart for movies like Plan 9 from outer space, half-cast, species, etc. And even though I give this movie a 1, I strongly urge anyone who has a bad movie for what it really is is a bad movie to find a friend, snack, something to drink and make the special occasion it deserves: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> From the very first moments of the main actor, the side-to-side eye-rolling performance is as he tries to inject intensity directly into the movie without looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight out of still images - put it heart out Rudolph Valentino) for the sudden hi-we are out of movie conclusion, you will ... not ... not ... stop ... laugh. <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie, it's a poor warrior's downstairs, finished - and that description alone should be enough, but then the "spaghetti eating scene", "we" I have their tickets, they won't leave the city now 'scene', 'It's the Asians! Drive !!' and more. The only really inappropriate part is a free-filtered rape. Outside this, I dare you to watch this movie. And I dare to find signs of action, or lines or direction, or any of the other boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say a movie should be judged as good. <br /> <br /> If this movie doesn't give rise to uncontrollable laughter before it ends, I can only roll my eyes scary from side to side on you and shout: "You dog! You dog! You dog!"
