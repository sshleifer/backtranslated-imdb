Hell paying was a disappointment. It didn't have anywhere near the substance of a B Western movie, and should in no way be compared to a great movie like Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the plot was torpid, the soundtrack was indulgently unnecessary, and the play was terrible. Even those professionals could have taken some lessons from Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it exhibited some of the best Cowboy shooters in the nation, but you can see them in better light in any SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very tempting and the preview is decent, but it is quite right after that.
