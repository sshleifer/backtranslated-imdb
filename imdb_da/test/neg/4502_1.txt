Having been a Godzilla fan for many years, Gamera was a cheap knockoff to exploit the success of Tohos # 1 kaiju star. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at that time (1975) an almost painful experience. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla celebration, known as the G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA vs. VIRAS, emerged. Of course, they contained this movie. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course you have to be in the right mind to see it. On a scene, for example, the hunters caught aboard the room are ready to escape by distracting the non-bright aliens. When they realize they have been duped, one of them says, "It's fun ... I think the kids lied to us." Not even PLAN NINE FROM Outer Space boasts that kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> This may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this is a decent enough time consuming if you see it in the right state of mind. <br /> <br /> But if you want top quality kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 out of *****
