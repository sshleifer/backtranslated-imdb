Before I saw this masterpiece, I had never guessed that a devastating and hitherto contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs". Ralf Moeller's performance is gigantic; realism glowing. I was so inspired, I fly straight to Zambibwia tomorrow to break out pesto and bring my hands together to the third world prosperity. God bless this movie. Seriously, I have to see Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to build a more violent cliché dialogue. It is so tortured that it can be better to take a cheesegrater to your bones to sit through it. The only ease it manages to achieve is in its thinly condemned racism, when the poor islanders turn to the ineffective stupid collective prayer that does not achieve anything until the überermenschlich, linen-covered teutonic hero Moeller, with his direct line to Yahweh can provide a blood sample that the hornblown Yankee researchers can work on and save the unhappy natives. This movie sucks.
