I usually love Jackie Chan movies, but it was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 battle scenes, all of which are up to normal standard more or less. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on car chasing / driving. The car hire is not that bad (but not as exciting as the game), but car racing at the end is unusually boring. Basically, it takes all things that make a Jackie Chan movie a Jackie Chan movie and leave it all with Jackie Chan. Even the traditional exits at the end lack their usual humor. I assume to some extent that it got worse because I saw one of the horrible copied versions. I usually see the subtitle version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. I've only seen a Jackie movie worse that this one and that was one of his early delays in Hollywood movies that didn't show up as well. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports.
