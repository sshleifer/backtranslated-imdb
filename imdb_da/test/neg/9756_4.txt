Enter the movie with the right expectations, I liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I totally agree that the plot was razor thin, clich√©, and I could predict every plot twist from the beginning of the movie. But the dancing sequences were very well done and I really enjoyed the fusion between classical and hip hop dancing (both of which I enjoy watching). The music / soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "drama" scenes more tolerable. The wires (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dance throughout the film was impressive and fascinating. All in all, a movie is worth seeing if you like to see good dance sequences, and this movie is much better than "You Got Served" in terms of plot and drama. So again it doesn't say much, does it? = P
