This movie had very few moments of true drama. After opening hours, the movie came down in a spiral that didn't take us to hell and back - it was mildly pure purgatory. The action was more horrible than the movie's subject and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was gloomy - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who had previously been some where in the past. It was definitely a mockery of the exorcist. The collection in the church must have been full of copper the day Mr Russo signed up for this. Do I speak Latin A tu Brutus.
