Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays immersed agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that is so bad it makes the worst movie you've ever seen become the second best movie you've ever seen. The seventh movement - if you can call it a megalomaniac that is trying to take over the world. It's so unfunny, it's totally pathetic. About the only thing that Anne Hathaway does as agent 99, it looks good - she doesn't seem unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has the fine sense of limiting his screen time to about 90 seconds, and a few faces from the TV series occur in very small roles. Movies are supposed to be a part thriller and some action movie. Nor is it. Although I really wasn't the fan of the TV series, it was certainly bright years ahead of this piece of hit. All this does is pull it through dirt and cheaper whatever good memories we had of it. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Continue making crappy movies like this and send it to the multiplexers every week. No wonder the film industry goes down the pipes. This movie is so messy, it's not even good at laughs. If this movie was a newspaper, it could be used to lens the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable than this. Rating zero minus five stars. Unless you are a masochist, stay away. Better still, do what the title says - Get Smart and save your nine money. You will be able to buy approx. 2 liters of gas with it. Put it in your car and be thankful you won't waste it on a multiplex to see this bomb!
