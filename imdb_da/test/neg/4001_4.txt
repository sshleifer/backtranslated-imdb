Normally I love these "Stranger Within" thrillers. Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Female" and "Audition." Well done, they can be very fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares. Of course, the opposite can be true: done badly, they can be boring and stupid. The "Hand that Rocker Cradle" is one of the latter. Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) bid another member to their family. But busy Claire is persuaded by Michael to hire a nanny. One day, a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay), and because she works perfectly, shows her the bar counter. Of course, when she comes up, their idyllic life slowly becomes unraveling ... This movie suffers from an abundance of problems, but the greatest is the handling of the villain. Peyton is never credible. Part of this has to do with how she is written and how she has acted. The things she does are supposed to put us on the brink of being so constructed that they are ridiculous. The Mornay doesn't help much. She portrays Peyton as two different people. While it is true that she must be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, you create Mornay's performance dividing the two facets of her character. The other actors are good though. Annabella Sciorrra is amazing as the asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately the script lets her down. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. Julianne Moore is lovely as Claire's friend Marlene. Moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately she is only on the screen for a total of five minutes. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good instructor, but you wouldn't know about seeing this dud. The movie has a few decent shocks, but it is poorly paced, and the climax, while generating excitement, is actually a bit ridiculous. That said, he works with a script that at best can be called pathetic. <br /> <br /> Trust me when it comes to nannies, stick to Fran Drescher. This should have been in direct-to-video bin.
