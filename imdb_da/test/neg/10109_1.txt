Now I start with this: I love horror movies, not even the worst plot or the most insane horrible spectacle will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and excitement present. Second; This is the worst movie of all time. It even beats Mean Guns and attacked by killer tomatoes. And for that I pay that tribute. <br /> <br /> But the involuntary humor was only fun until half of the movie was gone, after which everything was so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews were somewhat shared; and you who rated this piece of C-movie crap from 7 and up; I know you're jokers! Well !! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world and we just have a little bit of the same notion of what quality is; You can't be too real. <br /> <br /> Everything that is worth mentioning about the content has already been summarized pretty well so I will leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where the guy of the masked rubber masks pulls the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes with such horrible music scores and the mind blowing dialogue between them Two, make it really for me.
