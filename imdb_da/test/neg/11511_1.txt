I can't find this show at all fun. In fact, I think it's much worse than any of the other horrible Disney channels right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can't act. The whims of this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member who has a little (and I mean a bit) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There are both really stupid and just horrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show are terribly corny. It is corny humor that only little girls find fun because their brains have not yet developed. Now I have explained my hatred to the play and the horrible humor, what's next? The whole prize of the show is a stupid idea. She changed her mind again (not so scientifically a leg-loving one) and suddenly she doesn't recognize her? It's moronic. In summary, I hate this show, but little girls who don't have a fun concept will enjoy it, so I think that's what they go for over quality. Although I can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the other. BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT SEE THAT. <br /> <br /> My rating: Awful to show. TV G. 30 min.
