Bad script? Check. Awful effects? Check. Terrible actors? Check. Lame direction? Check. <br /> <br /> After watching the DVD box in blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, I put my $ 4.28 on the line and rented this "movie". My boyfriend was out of town and I was sorry so late on Tuesday night I decided it would be a perfect time for me to see what seemed to be (based on box cover cover) a horror movie. What I got instead was the worst movie ever made. Until then, I had always declared "Slumber Party Massacre 3" the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you're the type who wants to watch a movie because you've heard how bad it is, it's for you. If you do not want to lose $ 4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes in your life, remove that waste. <br /> <br /> An added note: I've noticed a few "actors" come here and write comments on the bulletin board. How can you boast about being in this movie? You were all horrible. I mean really bad. If there was an American idol for actors, you would all be laughing at the first few episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
