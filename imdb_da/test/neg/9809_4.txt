Pretty Twisted Horror movie that has a few good moments here and there, with some scary blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring for its own good. All the characters are ok, and the story, while having a lot of potentials, is pretty boring, but the blood transfusion scenes look scary real, and as a result, they were extremely disruptive. It is well made and decent written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up, plus I found the end to be disappointing. Linnea Quigley has no more than a very small role in this, so I was also disappointed with it, and Stephen Knight does a good job as the lead when he was pretty twisted, plus I got this in a DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a bunch of other Horror movies. There is plenty of blood, but that's not all that gory, and for the low budget it was pretty well done, but as I said it just couldn't maintain its interest. This is a pretty twisted horror movie that has some good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring for its own good I would pass, but I think it's worth seeing if you have nothing better to do. The direction is OK. Elly Kenner & Norman Thaddeus Vane does an OK job here with decent camera work and does a good job on the low budget, but the pace is too inconsistent for my taste. The action is actually okay. Stephen Knight is great as the driver, he was crazy, twisted, sick and gave a very creepy performance, the most eerie thing about it, even though he was like a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is okay, I guess the sin of his short time. The rest of the molding is also ok. All in all, I would pass, but I think it is worth seeing if you have nothing better to do. * 1/2 out of 5
