At least for me. I've been following Mr Almdovar's career since the beginning, and I didn't like this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was mistaken, the type of woman she portrays doesn't look so good, she makes the sign incredible. Also the song scene was just weird. I didn't get the point, and the sync was horrible. As a Spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts, the accents. Why do people come from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and makes no sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I tried to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", it's not like that anymore. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more, but this time Mr.Almodovar didn't deliver, at least for me. I'm not saying Miss Cruz does a bad job, I say she doesn't belong there and doesn't portray that character.
