Move over manos. Back from Boogens. It doesn't take a baby genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this tome) will now and always (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie ever. The only horror in this thing is seeing it. I wonder if it was an attempt by someone to meet babes by casting a movie. If this were the case, babes are not babies like this is not a movie. It is fun. No waiting. I cancel the word drunk by calling it drunk. Ulli Lommel (of Boogey Man's fame) would call it "uber drakk" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on a shelf in a video store, immediately return from it and inform the authorities.
