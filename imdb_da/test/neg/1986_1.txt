This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. The problem is that it does not know if it will be an intelligent political film, "artistic" or an exercise is erotic. As a result, all accounts fail. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, the narrative off putting and the supposed symbolism meaningless. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this movie, but it's not a good thing. Sure he has an intense and "unique" look, but in the end he can't actually act. Just look at how he responds when his mistress leaves. I say you are too many.
