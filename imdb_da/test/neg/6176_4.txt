After the whirlwind success The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "gem" head straight to video. Each copy was rented for months, and I even heard some good buzz about it. So months later I caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all ... one of the sites in the movie (Walpole Island) is a place I used to visit regularly as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool huh? It's about where the coolness ends with this dud. I think the story is decent enough to justify a four and even direction is not bad, but the show is just awful and even ridiculous with some really wasted star force and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays a native Canadian / American hitman?!?! What in the name of the Lord did they think? He doesn't even look like Native Blood, and his attempt at the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous. They could have been anywhere with this story ... they could have hired a native actor or changed Rourke's character, what about a white man's upbringing of native parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. As you might have caught Mickey Rourke's "stars" in Killshot, I use this term solved. I never liked Rourke much, though his Oscar's winning performance was decent enough. This shows and confirms my habits for him. He bored, bored constantly, and his lame attempts to portray a native border to insult I would believe. He does a decent cold-blooded killer, but the story never explores the part of him that is back in history. Diane Lane, although respected in Hollywood, turns to another killing performance. She has had her moments, but generally she usually does not go into a performance. She looks like she's getting good, but when she's not, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays his protective man. I've always felt Jane deserves a bigger career than he has. I think he has action star in his blood. All said and done his performance in Killshot is actually not bad. He does not take things too far and he is hard and almost heroic in a way. He and Lane manage to have decent chemistry, but he doesn't get much in the way of his character. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) made this movie and B) had a character at all. Her character is absolutely useless and had no point in the plot or story that made any performance she would give just as bad. I have rarely seen a character that supports so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this movie is the one given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the horrible mini-killer who wants to quit Rourke's hitman. Gordon-Levitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging. If this movie had been completely about him, it would have been a smash. He literally saves this from complete crap. His performance is almost worth looking at for this drive. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominated director ... who's waiting? Yes Oscar nominated director John Madden (I think football coach could have done a better job) helms this mess. In fact, I've never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical recognition it received and it surprised me because the direction of this movie and the characters was pretty horrible. Scriptwriter Hossein Amini hasn't done anything I recognize, but apparently has been slated to write the next Jack Ryan movie and after that mess I can't even imagine why they wanted him. I understand that this is based on a novel, and I really hope that the novel is worlds over this mess. A little bit of action and a kind of hokey attempt on an emotionally charged story of a hitman and his partner and the mess they get involved in. Unfortunately, unless you are a great Rourke fan or really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt then there is No need to put yourself through this pain. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 4.10
