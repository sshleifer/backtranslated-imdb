Sometimes a movie cannot be easily classified. Such a movie is "Tank Girl", share cartoon, share comedy and share action flick. I'm sure there's a "Tank Girl" audience, but it's extremely small, perhaps punk, comic book readers. Most viewers will be looking for an early departure or live with the fast-forward button. The only redeeming quality is short mood blasts "find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers", but these small moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the sophomoric action sequences. There is no sign development, which is not surprising as the source is a cartoon. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid. - NOTE
