Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and sidekick Dink Hooley (South Saylor) are traveling cowpunches who can't seem to be in a place very long. In "Helltown" the boys go to Montana, where they meet Rudd's cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It is a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start as chefs with the crew, although Dare becomes self-conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) rides into the camp. Judy is Tom's girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Fillmore has a cattle herd to move and promotes Dare to drive, partly to prove to Judy that he can't be up to the job. Meanwhile, the bad guy Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) has eyes on Fillmore's cattle, but when his henchmen don't break the crew, he shows it's easier to win the money that Dare was paid at the end of the trail. Conning Dare in a rigged card game with his husband Brady (James Craig) begins Dare's money to evaporate by hand. It is only when Dare fails to appear again at Fillmore's ranch that Tom goes out to find his cousin. Exposing the cheats, Tom, Dare and Dink high tail it before the evil ones can revenge. <br /> <br /> "Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a few years after the Waynes series of Western for Lone Star Productions. It only slightly changes the Lone Star formula; Wayne gets the girl at the end of the movie, but here he tried. There is a large runaway horse scene where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt, where Johnny Mack Brown's horse makes a complete somersault game. South Saylor does a good job as the comic relief pal, who does his best to sell lightning bars to unsuspecting victims. He replaces famous faces George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, staples of the Lone Star films. John Wayne's charisma begins to evolve here and prepare him for steps to superstar status which he eventually achieved. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" was based on a novel by legendary Western writer Zane Gray. If you're looking for more movies based on Grey's stories, try "Fighting Caravans" with Gary Cooper, "The Light of Western Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe and "Desert of Desert" with Randolph Scott.
