All things old are new again. Erika E. is on celebrity fitness (VH1); Florida State Rep. Mark Foley is the national buzz for allegedly sending sexually explicit emails to a 16 year old. old male side. As I am editing Mr Mr.Foley departs from his representative seat. Mr.Foley you see, makes his turn to act as the father of the restored girl seen during the opening order. My place in film history will forever be solidified with my appearance on the cemetery scene. I should have looked at this as an omen. I hate to say it, but be warned. If you place this on your DVD, prepare yourself to put your toe on the triggergun trigger you will soon have between your teeth. Your level of depression is reached. I've seen better writing on the screen of an Etch a Sketch.Shot in 1999-00 under the title "The Librarians" in and around Palm Beach Co. Why the librarian you ask you would have to be packed as closely as binding to read something in this frat party over the hill stunt men husband their trade on celluloid for a last time. Good enough with accolades ... Burt Reynolds as Irish mobster, in Miami no less ... possibly the worst forced accent impression since Linda Lovelace in "Deep Throat". .William Forsythe as a hip, slick and cool hard guy ... doubtful, possibly 10 years ago. I'd say it's curtain time for Mike Kirton. You now have Forsythe to pass this sub par movie, more like a movie school project, to everything on tape, disc or paper your local reseller has to offer.
