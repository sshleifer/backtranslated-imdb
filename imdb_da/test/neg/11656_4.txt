This was included on the disc "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather dull collection of short films. Shorts are among my favorite styles of film, but somehow, the people who assemble this second collection have found it difficult to find quality content - and it was not as good as the first volume or other shorts. <br /> <br /> This short film feels like it is extremely incomplete. There is a story, but so much unanswered, that the viewer, like me, feels a little discharged and unfulfilled. The movie begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (it's a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that is sometimes a little difficult to follow. Since I have difficulty hearing, I would probably have loved if it had been closed in the picture. Anyway, her boyfriend goes for a swim while she's kidding. When she wakes up, she is a dog away. She panic and makes the guy follow her all to look for the dog. They spend most of the time and argue and are unpleasant. Then they stop having sex, out of the blue. Later they find the dog's end of the story. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters go, both seemed dysfunctional and unlikely. She was a fussy and demanding lady, and he seemed to have contempt for her. When you wondered why they were together, their little sex break showed which bond they held together. <br /> <br /> Some like the characterization - I kept finding the people annoying and unreal - more like caricatures than people you can meet or know. Also the down payment for all this is just not worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).
