To say that, Mind of Mencia is the worst, most eerie show on Comedy Central, and possibly all the TV ... ever. I love Comedy Central and watch many shows and movies there all the time, but every time the intro to this show starts after a good comedy, I can't find the remote quickly enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia tells used, worn out racist jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, it will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say "they liked it so your entire run like it and extension me too ". Give me a break Mencia, I do not know if these people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes, does not mean he thinks you are fun , it just means you put him on the spot, and what should he do, hit you on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful and thought-provoking, which is evident in his advertising, but when you actually see the show, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you don't have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says you might be completing class 3 Carlos. The guy continues to say that he says what others are only thinking about, but I think you will find that if someone thought about what he was saying, they figured out on their own that it was ridiculous and that is Therefore, they never said it in the first place. <br /> <br /> All in all, one episode looks and does with it if you have to, because once you've seen 1 episode, you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central keeps renewing this awful show is far beyond me. If you are looking for good comedy, look elsewhere because you will find very little of this here.
