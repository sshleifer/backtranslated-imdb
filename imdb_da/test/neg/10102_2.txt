I just watched this on TV today. It was on ABC's Sunday afternoon movie. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a very good movie, but for a low budget independent movie like this it was okay. There is excitement in it, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down. The script is rather boring, and the plate elements are not very realistic, such as. A 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone reports a murder. I don't know what the author was thinking when they came up with that idea, but it's not very realistic. I thought this movie would be a great thriller because there were a few scenes that would make them feel good, but unfortunately they never did. There were a couple of plate elements that have been used in other films that look like this, and eventually it turned out not to be very creative. <br /> <br /> If there's anything good about this movie, it's thrown away. Each actor in this movie did well with what they had to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. But if you want to see a movie of her that is really good, watch the excellent animated movie The Incredibles. In that film she put her sexy voice to good use. What can I say, this movie is not really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they were all wasted on this movie, which is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good thriller, but eventually it fell flat. If you want to see a good movie that looks like this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, you should see some of their other movies. You can really really pass this movie on if you ever get the chance to see it.
