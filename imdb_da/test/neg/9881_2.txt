My first impression when I read synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was very, very different from the book. The movie trailer said the film should take place when Vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in America. She meets Aiden, a hopeful graphic novelist. Working in a chocolate shop of the day, she must accept that she will never be normal, for every full moon she becomes a loup-garou - a thought-provoking mythical being that can be compared closely to a werewolf. <br /> <br /> Most of the small changes did not work for me, though I am a fan of the book with the common title of Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support the book and believed that an age change, a change of attitude and a few small occupation changes would not affect history as a whole to make me tear my eyes out of their sockets and let me soften in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie unnecessarily killed many important characters, one of which was Esme, Vivan's mother, just outside the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. , tired and a little annoyed. Running through Romania, the camera's angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was ... interesting ... but it left me with the impression, "Why does Vivian look like this, and why does she have a hoodie?" Hoping for later parts of the movie I have to say that I am surprised that the screenwriters seemed to support incest in a way and instead of sticking to the character relationship of the book between Vivian and Rafe, the leader of The Five was now her cousin through her (surprise!) Aunt Astrid, who in the novel was the bitter and hated rival for Vivan's mother, and maybe I must add, no way related to any of them. <br /> <br /> To top Gabriel was somehow the leader of the package and obsessed that Vivian was his mate so that they could fulfill some non-existent prophecies. Not only did his appearance make a complete 180 from the description in the book, he was apparently also the father of Rafe. Yes, that's right, it's a nice little, incestuous knot of wolves, all tied together. <br /> <br /> Little things that annoyed me were scenes like the forest hunters. There was a redhead standing out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed their enemy" before their prey was free to run and be chased. Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I suppose my mind is not big enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the film without any explanation as to why she existed other than kissing beautiful victims. <br /> <br /> I loved how Amoeba was cut out of the movie. I loved how legally connected Aiden's past was, what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he told Vivian how his father wanted him to learn self-defense and then beat his father up "in self-defense" to make him work as such a tragic character. Character 180s are very fun when they are completely unnecessary. At the end of the film, I felt as if a person skimmed over the novel, scribbled down half the character name, drew a few connections here and there, said that Gabriel was a bit of a shake, Vivian fell in love with Aiden fearing her when he finds out she is a loup-garou of the legends, and "someone" is "killed by a silver ball" and there is some kind of happy ending because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera pictures were fairly decent and the casting could have been worse, but as for steering, why make the loup-garous leap into the air in human form as if they will fly (with their curved back and penchant for jumping from highlights), shimmer short and then fall to the ground as wolves? The only aspects of this movie that even had me saw it through to the very gruesome, apologetic end were the wolves, the beautiful landscape and the eye-candy boys. <br /> <br /> All I have to do to enjoy this movie at all, be ready for misunderstandings, strange events that are not always explained, incestuous innuendos, nor have they seen the book or have not read the book.
