The acclaimed Argentine horror director Emilio Vierya heads a script from Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the madness method. A doctor's son approaches his early death until his desperate father transplantes a monkey's heart into his chest. As expected, it will be strange; when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams beaches scouting nice looking girls to make his slaves. When heroin is injected, his beauties become zombies. The monster calls its dazed minions with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just bad. In the cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
