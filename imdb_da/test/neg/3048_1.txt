Once in a while I will see a movie that totally surprises me. One who comes out of nowhere to be a bit of entertaining entertainment. One who is pure fun from the beginning to the end. Reach people when a foreign call is not that movie. It's an incredibly stupid and far-fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic. Our leading heroine Jill is forced to become the child after crossing his cell phone minutes and being harassed by phone calls from a mysterious caller. Every clich√© in the world is used here from the stupid cat jump-out-to-a-hidden spot to the car that doesn't start the killer, can be anywhere at any time. This movie is bad ... not even bad in a "so bad, it's good way" more in a "so bad, it's boring way." Skip this godawful movie and save your movie for something else. You want to thank me later, trust me here. Degree: D-
