The worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie is a clean trash can. Everything is bad in this movie. Direction, manuscript, art, film, cast or something else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? The protagonist is a boy. It must be approx. 20 years, but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old. Moreover, he is a very bad actor. The editing tries to save it, but with the very bad material in hands, they can't do miracles. As I said, the casting is poor, the text is bad, it doesn't help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned to "not" make a movie.
