I thought this movie would be a disgrace to the series. After all, part 3 did not measure up to part 2, and one did not have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor was not quite as witty in this as in part 3, but it was fun enough to make the movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The girl's portion was pretty good. She is a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt simply would accept leaving her home and niece under the care of Mr Miyagi, a man she had just met. Of course he was a friend of his brother. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the monastery. One might think of some of my other reviews that I would not have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was fun. It showed that they know how to have fun. Now if there were monks in ancient China dancing to pop music, it would have been another matter. It was probably the most intelligent part of the movie when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks would not kill a mistake Miyagi told her that street bands are killing each other are stupid, nations are trying to destroy each other are stupid, but to have respect for life is not stupid. Miyagi has also expressed such wisdom in the other films. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Of course, there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as fun as part three, and no sign could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine seeing it again, but it's worth seeing once.
