I watched this movie over 20 years ago and had pretty good memories of it. Catch again on Cinemax this month, I realized how little the distinction I had about movies at that time. This is a plain spaghetti western, with absolutely nothing remarkable about it. Script, direction, acting, photography are all a big blah. Stick with Sergio Leone westerns!
