Comedy is a hard animal to conquer. Ishimoto fails on all accounts, as author and director. Some things, like making movies that are funny, should just be left to professionals. 1 out of 10. Horrible. It was not funny. I tried to laugh, but it just wasn't fun. I was not the only one, no one else at the Chicago festival was laughing, at least on the show I saw. Simply very bad, sorry :(
