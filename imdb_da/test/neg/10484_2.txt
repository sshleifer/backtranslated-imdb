When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes into a small Texas town, people begin to die. The County Council's sheriff tries to investigate, but is hampered by his efforts by other officials. It turns out there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teens in the forest. <br /> <br /> I like low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought there would be a good chance that I liked this movie. Unfortunately I didn't. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the bad plays, the corny dialogue, the terrible musical score or the gigantic plot gaps that this movie has. There are many movies that have the same problems that I have seen and enjoyed in such a bad way, this is a good kind of way. <br /> <br /> But where others of that kind and Night Fright are different, the Night Fright just has horrible pacing. And it pulls because of it. There are scenes that just go over and over without anything happening - searching the woods for tracks is just people who walk in the woods for a long time; there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting is going on. If these scenes were shorter, the movie might not have been so boring (though I don't think it would just cut those scenes away). <br /> <br /> I have now given this movie three views to make sure I gave it a try before slamming it into this review. Unfortunately, it has become worse with each clock. There won't be a fourth.
