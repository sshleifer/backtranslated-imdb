Unfortunately, the golden times of stylish Italian cinemas seem to have fallen into oblivion. And the recent brainchild of famous movie maker Lamberto Bava is yet another clear evidence of that assumption. I felt lucky to see many movies from this productive instructor (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and both Demons). Although not quite satisfactory, they have never been so boring. A suspicion that this new entry to my DVD collection was money thrown to the winds occurred shortly after in the car crash scene, showing an awkward and unlikely equality during the flip-over car. <br /> <br /> And the feeling of superficial upbringing grew up during the immensely narrative chain of events that followed. <br /> <br /> Stupid dialogues, suspicious script and a total waste of talents from the international cast. The only sign that gave more or less acceptable performance was the vicious Mark's son who smashed the entire boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mario's son jobs on all accounts could hardly be welcomed. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully an improvement.
