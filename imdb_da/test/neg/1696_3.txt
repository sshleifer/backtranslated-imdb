Pat O'Brien depicts Knute Rockne, All-American Notre Dame football coach. No doubt this movie will be significantly more appealing to those interested in any aspect of Knute Rockne All-American Notre Dame Football. It is probably most interesting for serious fans of football and / or Notre Dame football. You will see some good film films in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is difficult to recommend this as a FILM. It is not much more than a historical document. You will "know" the end is near when Gale Page gets a chill - and does not flash or you will miss Ronald Reagan, for all things, "Camille"! <br /> <br /> *** Knute Rockne - All-American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, Ronald Reagan
