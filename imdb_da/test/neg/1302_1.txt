In addition to all the negative reviews: I was amazed to see that at one drop at some point a CCTV camera was called in at a very unlikely place to show the tribe ("Look Maaaaa-aaam") what that was happening, especially near the Thames barrier, where the professor is hit by full (wind) force against the head of a heavy object and then lives to tell the story. Otherwise, I was not able to shake the picture of some actors portrayed in other films / programs: I said to my wife: "Hey, that's Neil, from the young" (Nigel Plans) and "Have they called Hercule Poirot to help? ' (David Suchet.) To add to the shame of this movie (shown in two parts at ITV UK recently), the ITV showed the Environmental Agency phone number after each episode for worried viewers living in flood-prone areas. TV stations go to treat your audience like that? What should the Environmental Agency have thought (("Oh no, it's Mrs Jones from Hull again. She says she was right all the time, she saw it on ITV" ).
