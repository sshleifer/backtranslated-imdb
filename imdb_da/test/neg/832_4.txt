OK, yes I know I am a philistine and I have no knowledge or love for opera. I easily admit that I might feel different about this movie if I did. But I do not. So, for those of you like me, skip this one unless you want to look at the beautiful (sometimes undisclosed) girls. For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (which I didn't recognize) was the best of the party.
