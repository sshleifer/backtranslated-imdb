Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT! This movie is horrible, absolutely horrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans, only to have their hearts broken. He kills a guy, gets shot and dies before half of the movie is over, not to mention that he was only for the first 10 minutes and then disappeared until the point he died ... why put him on the cover , if his character BLOWS. 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes promised in the back view preview? 3. It was too confusing I mean what about the girl? She had to tell the movie to TRY to get our attention she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie ..... it fails. Now I have to go and see 24 ..... THIS MOVIE FILE!
