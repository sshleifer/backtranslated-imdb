I just finished reading the book and was really looking forward to seeing this TV adaptation broadcast on the Hallmark Channel on Monday night (5/30/05). The key to the whole book was the manifesto, which was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but I saw for an hour (out of 3 1/2) and I saw the man with the steel teeth, but I never saw him steal a manifesto. I saw someone stealing some virus, but what does it have to do with the book? It's too bad because this movie had great production values ​​and a good cast, but it's not the idea to make a book a movie (TV or movie) to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience . They only held me for an hour. I thought the book's premise was great and what did they do but threw out the whole premise. This book had a great McGuffin (to rewrite Hitchcock), but they ignored it. And it said in the titles that Forsyth was involved in the production. They must have paid him a lot of money.
