Kidman and the law lack the chain to do this dormant, poorly written romance / melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts and <br /> <br /> wistfully hurts for her absent love law. She has just met him when he is whisked off to fight south in the civil war, and they have only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, but they are completely beaten. The law's main direction in all seems to be "look free and shell-shocked, but sensitive." Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this gloomy script, but she plays it all too broadly and over the top, as if she were the lead in 'Annie Get Your Gun'. Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged to a Monty Python sketch - the one from the `Holy Grail ', where the peasants constantly use to mud in mud making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay away when she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. <br /> <br /> When the action mills crash into the overall stage that is often, all the authors make a cry `Cue Simon Legree-type Villain! ' and Teague (Ray Winstone) gallops out of nowhere to make his indescribable dastardly actions, such as killing and torturing innocent godly citizens in the name of loyalty to a fast-paced <br /> <br /> Confederacy. All other times, he lacks in action, which is confusing even in this cornball script. There is an abundance of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets when he makes his Johnny Appleseed trek from the front line where he left, to Kidman's reluctant embrace in Cold Mountain. In the end, none of these signs mean. Law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these small mini-films has the same tired theme: war is in order and otherwise becomes decent Christian folk music for healthy animals. <br /> <br /> And the manuscript is too predictable, too heavy. Moreover, pacing the story is terribly slow. You use the whole movie to wait for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman twisting his hands and sucking, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes, just don't care anymore. You will look at your watch wondering how much more of this blow you have to endure. <br /> <br /> I give it a star out of five to the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the generals' loss of life on both sides of the conflict are powerful things. But it is only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.
