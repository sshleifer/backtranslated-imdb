This was an attempt at a romantic comedy and one that didn't work. Though the film was thrown in an interesting way, the gloomy script falsified the best effort of all. The failing ways of the director may have been successful if he had taken a stand. It was embarrassing to see William Baldwin and especially Armin Muller-Stahl.
