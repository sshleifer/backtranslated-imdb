The first time I had heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the "... laundry room" after just seeing Fight Club. In each urinal a small, round black circle was deposited. When the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicate), it caused a color image to form, with photographs of the two stars and the roof line "You will scare yourself". When you had finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again and is waiting for the spring to be the surprise of the next "victim". <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe the battlefield wasn't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like that in my life before, and these days of over a century cinema and marketing it is a really good experience. It's a shame that the movie that came with it failed to live up to the promise. I hate to pan Guest House Paridiso and I'm guilty of Rich Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, the invention of The Young Ones (1982 -1984), meeting sitting at the bottom (1991-1995) or even solo work as Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, this would have made a hilarious 45 minute television special. Unfortunately, it's an 89 minute movie. There is definitely some profit to be had, and I laughed all the time during the long-standing finals that falsified the Exorcist and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and involved ... well you'll have to see it a bit for yourself . Often, the pace is loaded and a sterile atmosphere is all the way through. The two stars (Edmondson takes his usual backseat, this time because of the fact that he suffices enough) never really get into the first gear, Mayall only occasionally shows the foul-mouthed craze that makes us love him on it small screen. In fact, the author's presumption is that we are already familiar with the signs that they are being subservient to the audience. The small hints of depth seen in the series (Richie's effeminate, failed eg Social climbing) are not present here, and instead we are back with parodies of parodies. The Fawlty Towers accusation passes water, complete with drunk cook and invisible, called to the waiter "Pasquele", who rashly rumbles with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a child's swing hanging over a cliff, are very, very fun, but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen, the two are constantly looking for a study album that is not there and all the "dead laugh" areas patched up with random "comedy" music that would have been dated in a Carry On movie two decades ago. <br /> <br /> The Paridisis brand of puerile, sadistic, perverted humor is IS fun, and I'm sure it makes you laugh ... just not as often as it should.
