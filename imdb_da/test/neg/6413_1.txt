This is the most stupid movie ever made. The story is ridiculous. His wife and children think he's crazy. Then they don't. Then it turns out that he is, and I think they knew it all the time. There is a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it's all his fault ... that is what Jim Carey does. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took this role ... this is a career delay. I think the target group for this is 11 and 12 year olds. And it adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10 year olds who also give up to 23. Or maybe it's for really stupid 23 year olds. Or maybe really stupid 32-year-olds because it's 23 conversely. Or maybe 46-year-olds would enjoy it because half is 23. I think looking at things on the internet about number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie unless you wanted to watch a comedy.
