I have to admit that out of the many many thriller movies I've seen, this must be one of the worst. I was shocked to find that this work had a 1.5 mile budget. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, pretty standard for this kind of movie, but still quite good. But as the film progressed, I began to feel clearly uncomfortable with the lack of pace as I saw, every sequence seemed to take hours. The reason for this could have been that the movie had already bored me to tears, nothing happened but endless accusations that were blown up by confusing flashbacks and occasionally bad moods. Well ... after winning through what felt like a lifetime of these scenes, we finally reached the grand finale ... an all, all dancing demonstration about how lack of imagination can completely ruin what might have been a good movie. <Br /> All in all, I found this movie predictable and boring, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone but the people I personally dislike, but if you have a few hours to waste and you will see a thriller, That is not even extremely scary, this is the movie for you.
