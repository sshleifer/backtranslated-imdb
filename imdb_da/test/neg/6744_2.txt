For me, it just didn't seem like GI Joe at all. When I looked at it as a child, I just didn't care. In fact, the part I liked best about this was the opening point. They change so many facts around and translate the story as well. Cobra Commander is apparently part of this stupid breed of reptile in Antarctica or a frozen place. Although I always thought he was a normal guy considering each time you saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by normally colored meat and not the blue was his face here. There is just too much scramble in this to try to make this a spectacular movie, but for me it just ruins what I have seen seriously in the first place.
