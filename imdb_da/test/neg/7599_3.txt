It has been a tradition since my first VHS recorder for me to collect more of the old chestnut incarnations by Charles Dickens, and I taped this and "Karroll's Christmas" this year. Fortunately, as this one was running on the Hallmark Channel for the infinite hour at 3 am, I was spared to edit ads from it. However, it was only to save grace. The scripture was tirelessly boring with almost no clever scenes to save it from being more than a teeny-bopper soaper as Beverly Hills 90210. In this one, a good man who was cast aside for his celebrity seems the only logical explanation on her transformation into a Scrooge-like TV talk show hostess. It wasted Dinah Manoff, who just plays bitch dude to the other bitch dummy Tori Spelling (who, incidentally, had several layers of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise boring adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best options are wasted as ghost entrances. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been spectacularly fun in the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey did not have a revelation. Tori Spelling can be a nice person, but she has all the acting skill in a mannequin, and it does everything for herself to a bad show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman work again, but the manuscript gives him nothing to do right, except scrolling his eyes and snuggling real lame dialogue. And what is most infuriating is that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now if anyone wants to write the ultimate Scrooge story of a George Bush and Karl Rove, we can have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you're a fan of Spelling and / or 90210, this might be your cup of Christmas songs. I prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself. This one I can just throw away before it is with me here for a long time. <br /> <br /> God saves us all!
