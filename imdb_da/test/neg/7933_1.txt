** Maybe spoilers ** ** Hard to spoil this thing more than it is, but just in case ** Gee, I can't see how anyone could have wanted this again! It was like a "made for T.V" show and still pretty lama for it. Lots of fake snow, bad stars of top stars, bad action and the crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the heck??!! I didn't really think it would be a great movie, but I was hoping to be entertained. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish the next day. I could have skipped the rest easily (but then I would have missed the big piney woods!) I am so glad I missed this at the theater! Bad enough to have wasted $ 3.50 in the video store. And I am a lover of policeman, action and drama film. This was a very smelly 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original every day !!
