In the midst of all the many problems that make this a crooked celluloid, the stupidest plot unit in recent movie history is. Richard Gere decides who Jackal's real goal is through some form of revelation. He doesn't work out anything, it just comes to him. When in doubt "He's after the first lady!". This film blows lumps.
