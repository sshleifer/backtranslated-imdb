Somewhere in the United States, young Clair manipulates his friends Mic, Billy and John, showing a letter that Bob would send to her, and the group swept beats Bob and Mic killing him with a piece of wood in the woods. Mic feels sad and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I think "The Wind" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The horrible manuscript is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary, since there is no story or plot, only sequences of interrupted scenes. The amateurish and acting is incredibly poor and terrible. It's amazing how manufacturers invest money in such waste, distributors release this crap around the world, and viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was curious to see how bad this movie could be and I was impressed as it is worse than I could imagine in my lowest expectation. In the end, I wonder why IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system, since the waste really deserves this vote. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
