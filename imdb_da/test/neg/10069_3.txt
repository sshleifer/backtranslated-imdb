<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure Sam Nell (Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (a Leoni (Family Man) <br /> <br /> A better title would be : ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REAL MEANING DINOSAURS But then no one would need to watch the movie. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays visit to the island of dinosaurs to save the teenage victim of a moving accident. <br /> < br /> ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a finished script, explaining why the movie seems to have little or no purpose other than demonstrating state-of-the-art special effects.Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them in. Dinosaur dolls and animation in JP3 are great for excellent and more numerous than ever, but the overall movie experience cannot hold a light to the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2. br /> <br /> JP3 is a compassionate short 90 minutes - they p th 10 minutes is cred sin. Even then, I found myself regularly checking my wristwatch. The audience I saw it left the theater in silence. <br /> <br /> A better game: watch the movie LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
