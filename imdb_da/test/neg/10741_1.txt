I disagree with Dante who portrays the democratic supportive zombies as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I think their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than that, something in the order of a Pelosi IQ ... A single digit figure, please friendly . <br /> <br /> The MOH series is rather uneven, and this is the very worst episode. Finally, Dante, another thoughtless Hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd sucking up the leftist business to resume his merciful career?), Must have admitted that his management exercises had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now. Thus came up with this war-inducing, effortless, left-wing "satire" of the Bush administration, the Republicans, and capitalism. Perhaps he felt that he had not been obviously political before. He would not even be the first no-talent to use Asian political propaganda to advance his career when everything else fails. The actor of Turks like "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee", Dante, has been as helpful as a contributor to the horror genre when Adolf Hitler had been in world peace. <br /> <br /> TH uses the lowest common denominator humor, cheap and predictable gags that even the bluest of all members of the blue collar would not have trouble understanding. Or have you ever seen a smart, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? Populist fertilizer has the basics of all messages, and therefore the language and manner in which this message is communicated must be as simple and basic as Sean Penn's name. And what better people to send this message to popcorn munching sheep than a pair of cocaine sniffing Tinseltown losers, all of which have fallen so low that they are forced to write to TV ... <br /> <br / > I don't want political propaganda, either Left or Right, in any kind of movie. But placing it in horror - of all genres - is a testament to the endless stupidity that ranks so high among Hollywood's anti-intelligentsia. So wise was Dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote Democrat ... (That's what you get to complete a movie school: Not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge of any one preferably part of the imagination.)
