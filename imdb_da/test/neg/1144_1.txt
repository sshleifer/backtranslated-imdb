I sat through all 2 hours. I don't know what was worse, the horrible plot, the lame figures or the Hawaiian hottie that Eddie's 11-year-old child and 80-year-old grandfather made sexual advances towards. The money spent on this was just washed down in the throne. Matty Simmons was ashamed. The original idea for this movie was "A Swiss Family Griswold" and it was somehow transformed into this mess. The only bright place is that it is reviews that were so bad we will never see this on TV again. AVOID ALL COSTS ... RENTED SEVEN XMAS or something else.
