"The Racketeer" stars Carol (stripped of "e" who usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman who was thrown out of society because she left her husband to a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who since has become a down-and-out alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest in the New York crime Kingpin Robert Armstrong (topbilled). It's almost a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: rigid direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow delivery of lines. At that time, the audio staff had told the directors to have their actors speak each line of s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start talking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. Performed about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin follows the poems of faithful sound recorder and systematically undermines the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had from watching their later films. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that, despite the transitional problems from silent to sound, gave us some legitimate masterpieces ?? Vidor's "Hallelujah!", Mamoulian's "Applause," Wyler's "Hell's Heroes", Capras "Ladies of Leisure"? everything from directors with strong will to tell the soundboard dictators to be filled and let their actors speak and act naturally. Too bad, Howard Higgin was not that strong; as it is to see a naturally fast actor that Armstrong hit through the part in the ridiculous way he was told to speak, you can just wonder where the 50 foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
