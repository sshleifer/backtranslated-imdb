Just what the world needed - another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. This movie gives unrelenting messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical "junior high" experience. They make learning something seemingly completely taboo. I can't stand the fake French accents, or the guys on the mopeds are running around, which eventually "falls" to the twins. Why do I put everything in brackets? Because it's all stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotype grandfather. They should be happy that they even have a grandfather at all. How does this fit the Mary-Kate / Ashley Shadow? This one has them to fix on a single guy (gasp !!) IS NOT their father !!!!! Yes, people, they actually have a mother that appears in all five seconds. I haven't even thirty minutes of this, and I can already tell you how it will end. This movie is so pitiful, it makes Miss USA seem like an academic bowl. Really.
