Okay, it's not possible to sugarcoat this. The reason was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the play was unbeatable, the effects were ridiculous, and all outdoor scenes seem to have been filmed in New York's Central Park. Having been told, there was something about this movie that I couldn't walk away from. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super-vixen or the amazons. <br /> <br /> Yet, I am not one to sit on the margins and criticize without pointing out a few redeeming qualities, so here they are. <br /> <br /> A violent off-shoot of women's lib movement is portrayed in a desert setting (the central park of course) and all the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed. In addition, some of the scenes where certain characters lose consciousness are entertainingly dramatic (you will notice that I am writing dramatically, rather than convincingly). All I can say is that some people like B movies and I'm one of them. If you are one of them, then give it a ride. Cheers, Mr Kincaid. This is one for ages.
