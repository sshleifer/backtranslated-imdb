This criticism tells the story of 4 little friends who went to see the angels and demons movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because "angels and demons are worth it". Two of the four had read the book. Of those who didn't, a guy had pink pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful part of the evening after seeing the scary angels and demons. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a laboratory where the antimatter occurs while another process is taking place. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how much confused I am. I don't understand what happened: they just made the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on a person's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They take out almost CERN and the symbology associated with it. They take out Hassasin and replace him with some religious British guys. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's near-rape scene. They take out Langond's fight with Hassasin (now British guy on crack). They take the press officer out for them. They take out the death of the fourth cardinal. They assume that Camerlengo will be Pope. They take out Camerlengo's big scheme. They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and land on the island towards the end. They assume that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and unfortunately they take out Vittoria's sexual appeal. <br /> <br /> Apart from the movie Totally loses focus on the details, the movie becomes HORRIBLY. One must admit that there were some good things. For example, the Sistine chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. The explosion scene was MIND BLOWING. Apart from that, SCREW THIS MOVIE TO RUINING THE BOOK OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT READ IT.
