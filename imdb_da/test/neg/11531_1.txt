I was happy the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down the hill. The excitement began to be thin, and the jokes are just the same everywhere. What was it, they were good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this movie is that it is trying to be funny, just as Tarantino and God are the obsolete things. Tarantino is a little overstated sometimes, this movie comes ten years late. At best, it's for teenagers, and I'm sure many of them find the character of Johann fun as he is for the first 30 mins. The other problem I have with it is that the story falls away at the end more and more, you tried to find a recovery point. Maybe it wasn't restored because the lack of passion comes with the attempt to try to be wise fun. Like in many movies, good actors who can afford it are certain not to require a better dialogue or just turn the script down.
