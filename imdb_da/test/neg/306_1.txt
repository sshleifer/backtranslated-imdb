"Fat Girls" is among the worst movies in the indie gay genre. The premise is promising: An average homosexual teenager is trapped in an oppressive little TX city. His only related spirits are the other village, HS abusers: the 'fat girl' class, a naive immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive drama teacher. So far, interesting. In theory, this plot line creates a decent set-up for an attractive age story with a built-in audience --- the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns throughout America and experienced this youth's anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of self-defeating humor. Unfortunately, rather than a nuanced drama, Ash Christian is approaching her autobiographical subject with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a casting of unlikely, derived, two-dimensional characters that the viewer cannot, but helps to feel indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Goth bitter navel gazer. She is such a stinging, unsympathetic person; There is little doubt about the cause of her kind condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) records zero. This may have been poor casting, but is more likely due to a manuscript that simply cannot be resolved. As a result, you leave yourself when such a non-existent bond exists, which could possibly justify their almost constant companion throughout history. Sabrina's new-found girlfriend, Rudy (the Jesus), and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clich√©d stock figures ripped out of dozens of other films. Rudy is the creepy exotic immigrant / geeks promise directly from any raunchy teen "comedy" ever made in television or movie. Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus and great hair. Just as you thought Tammy Faye had been put to death, Christian introduces a scene where Judy's mascara runs with his tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who may think that this tired old stereotypical gag is still fun after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years? In addition to the unsuccessful attempts at sardonic humor, there are many enigmatic inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a "fat ugly" loser. However, he also manages to participate in informal and regular improvised trysts with the ubiquitous school jock / hunk, Ted (Miller). Although these compounds are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most homosexual teens (full of raging testosterone like their heterosexuals) would appear to be a rather enviable event given the more common alternative to involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his love in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic England transplant. Unlike all credible odds, the charger does not only land in this small TX hamlet, but is conveniently open to homosexuals. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an ice cold, sour smart aleck, and the viewer is left with scratches for his magnetic appeal. <br /> <br /> Much to his pleasure, Rodney is invited by his new love for the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be a DJ. On arrival, the boyfriend immediately leaves Rodney solo and leads to another area at the bar for a quick meeting with a pretty beautiful young man. This is yet another of the ridiculously inexplicable plural elements, as Rodney's feeling as an outcast is presumably derived from his lonely existence in a city. As small as the city, do they openly have gay students in high school? A secret bisexual football captain? Lesbian Moms? A gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men, no less)? Apparently, the place is not so backwater. Ten years earlier, Todd Stephens' Edge of Seventeen covered almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching and humorous film.
