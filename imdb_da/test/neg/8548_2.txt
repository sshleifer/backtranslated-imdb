YOU NOTE TO ME (1941) is an example of 'ScrewBall Comedy', which started in the mid-1930s and ended the post-war period (World War II). Some of these films retained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when they were initially critical and box office flops. Like BRING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & FRU. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one that the value just keeps sinking. <br /> <br /> Why can one be rooted in the manuscript / story. It derives credibility from coming and betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to the millionaire HENRY FONDA, who is sindssy jealous. He would be happy to sit back with his million dollars and love her, she wants to maintain her profession as a doctor. She wants him to stay in what her eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict must assume us. It cannot be saved by either the protagonist or the beneficiary. <br /> <br /> The errors in this scenario can be clearly seen at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDA's character is written in such great lines that every viewer has an immediate reluctance for him. BARBARA STANWYCK has nothing to do but reacts to every idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have spent too much time outside the studio being a "useful idiot" and then being at work. Of course, COLUMBIA didn't get their money from him, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should be taken over.
