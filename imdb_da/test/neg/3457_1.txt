The exhibition of the Ichabod Crane character was so incredibly unlikely that my wife and I hoped that the rider (or other character) would not only cut off the wreath of the wreath but make it slow and painful. <br /> <br /> I mean, this Brent Carver guy played it over the top --- as if he were on Broadway. And he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him at all. <br /> <br /> I could go on with specific criticisms of how this movie failed, but I prefer not to use energy. <br /> <br /> Just skip it and go to the Johnny Depp version. Either that, or rent the Haunted Pumpkin of Sleepy Hollow (animated). It's pretty good - entertaining for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> Better yet, read Washington Irving's original story.
