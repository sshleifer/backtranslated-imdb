Daniel Auteuil Bruno in Petites Couperes is a medieval model of his Pierre in Christian Vincent's La Separation 10 years ago. In both films, youthful trust in leftist ideology and love (mutual metaphors) melts into paranoia - manifesting itself as captured aggression in Pierre and desperately comic woman in the newer Bruno. Unfortunately for the Auteuil fans, the actor has become dependent on uniformity worldwide (not unlike the compatriot Johnny Hallyday in Leconte's latest l'Homme du Train). It is not and will be quite frustrating when the film progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as the project's author / director. His sequencing of episodes superimposed with connecting symbolism fails to dampen the film's lack of rhythm. I was particularly furious that the impressive dramatic / romantic backgrounds in Grenoble were made almost redundant by a camera man who apparently shook the cold. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas almost saves the show with his female counterpart to Bruno, Beatrice. She dramatizes the dizzying contradictions that are thought of as Bruno in a character of increasing complexity in order to become surreal. Bonitzer cannot maintain this however, and the flag plot requires Beatrice to smooth out to another bourgeois mannequin. By making Bonitzer show, the Scott Thomas denies the Oscar cabinet. <br /> <br /> All of the sign's immersion in the bourgeoisie can be a viable and truly tragic result, but in this case, it is a fate of a cadence (as opposed to the brutal, painful degradation of La Separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10.
