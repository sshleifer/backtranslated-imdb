I was attracted to this movie of its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. It's a 20-inch guy flops in the Big Apple and comes home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It may just have worked, but there is a problem. And that problem is the name Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. His actor mantra must "exercise as little effort as possible at all times". Or "why speak when you can mumble?" Or maybe "put yourself in a coma as soon as the camera rolls". Lips move when talking? Button. Facial expression? None. Muscles in the face? Crippled. Something? Nothing. Anything? Zip.
