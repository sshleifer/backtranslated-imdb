"Jefferson in Paris" is a really confusing movie. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unimaginable light that paints him as a liar, racist, and pedophile, but does not offer a shame of condemnation to these sins. That was how he thought the movie was saying. The end of the sentence, the end of the movie, the door is behind you. After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson continues to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a gay English painter (the criminally underutilized Simon Callow). A possible event sends Maria to England, and Jefferson continues to forget her at an astounding rate for a man who, just a few minutes on the screen time before, asked her to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> He's got confused, you see by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his slaves has just come from America. Just why he's confused is hard to know - even though Sally is unimaginably beautiful, she seems like a simple child in front of Jefferson. When she doesn't tell ghost stories in exaggerated "dark" speech patterns, she wraps around her bedroom and almost jumps to her upscale mass. <br /> <br /> If her behavior is an attempt to apologize to Jefferson's, it doesn't. It doesn't work. Jefferson desperately desires when Mary, tired of waiting for her letters, travels from England to see him. I have not changed against you, he insists and offers weak excuses for not writing. For her credit, Maria immediately sees through his breaststroke. When Sally pops up and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and terribly in my opinion) in Maria's very presence, the illusion falls out completely. No one believes today that Jefferson, Washington, and the rest were complete parades of virtue and morality. Nonetheless, we must believe that the learned, distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how "friends of the masses of the French do not deny 'aw corn' and who rubs against his front when she goes past just before Mary's eyes <br /> <br /> Even though we release it, it follows from the horrible revelation that Sally was only 15 when this affair took place (Jefferson was 41) Strange this fact only comes out At the end, when Sally's brother James is understandably enraged at her blasphemy that she wears Jefferson's child, Jefferson is just as blunt when he tells that Sally is carrying her child, and protesters tell her she would be much better off under his protection than free and live in France with his brother, but he promises I release her when I die and our children (including more coming, says Jefferson in a chilling statement from Sally as * his *) when they reach 21. Oh thanks, mas See you feel like telling the screen. Big deal. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is still coming, but involves Jefferson's daughter Patsy. She is already angry with him, first to break his promise, made to her mother on her death bed, not to marry again. (Of course, the woman was not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson has also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun she wants, despite previous moralisation of religious freedom (it seems to mean freedom to agree with him). <Br /> <br /> Having promised Sally and her brother their freedom, Jefferson calls Patsy to preserve the purchase and promises to fulfill it if something happens to him. Sally's brother blurs out of the baby's impending birth, and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, though she has almost nothing to say. Her face extends almost in painful pain through this revelation, but she controls her grief and whispers yes. <br /> <br /> If anything, and the filmmakers could have had something if they had emphasized this point more, "Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of women's status at the end of the 18th century, seen even by men like Jefferson as attractive property, comfortable but without true intellect or souls. We see Jefferson throwing a few tears over a letter from Maria, apparently telling him where to go, but he soon laughs away at a wild dance from Sally, complete with thrown hair and swollen skin. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this is a precise portrait of Jefferson or not. I don't care to see it, but just to see it. This Jefferson is no one wholly or even an anti-hero. He is a selfish, lying child mole - and the one who gets away with it - not the kind of man I want to see a movie about.
