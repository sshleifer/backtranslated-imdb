Of all the directors ever having to sit behind a camera, Wellman could break your heart faster than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he seemed to know it, probably from his jejune treatment, not much over a Bonanza or Big Valley. <br /> <br /> But there is a moment, typically Wellman, coming out of nowhere to destroy you, Gable's wife's death. She has gone to give her baby some water, and WHAM is immediately killed by an arrow. No warning. Nada. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinemas. Especially after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked like a sappy western. Of course, the treatment of her afterwards with Wellman's total indifference, apparently, to the film. Yet it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.
