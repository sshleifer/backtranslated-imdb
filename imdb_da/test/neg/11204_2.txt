Gordon Scott made some good Tarzan movies, but this is not one of them. As I looked at, it sounds like the bad, obviously interior set and the hollow tree "clonking" sounds as they went across allegedly dirt trails, and cringing at the bad dialogue and worse acting among the supporters I continued to think , "Sheesh! This is the TV show level!" Then I find out that it was actually three TV show pilot sections that woven nails all the way into one. It's great to see Scott coming outside (alone) away from the lame sets, in a couple of scenes; and the fighting has some really good moves ... but oh, ow and also with regard to the dialogue. And have I mentioned the play? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most people. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of a nail to see a younger Sherman (ie, Scatman) Carothers acting as a native. But probably not worth the total time investment.
