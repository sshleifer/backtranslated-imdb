I just watched this movie. I liked the soundtrack. I first saw the trailer and was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies they know how to sell.But the movie is almost awful, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then .... like almost every new movie they blow it up . I don't get the idea why the child died? Being a clich√©, every nigga movie must have a child killed and everyone must be good after his death. LOL.I don't understand what's the connection with the movie ... And so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes. Nothing new in this movie. I saw 'You earned' the same idea, but also ... something new ... this is something like 'Honey' but is not a slight difference between them. If you have no other option, watch this movie, but be sure is the last option you take. And choreography is worst than ever before. This is not a must see for sure ...
