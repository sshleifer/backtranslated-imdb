The film had an interesting surprise. Something psychologically gripping. And the decision makers could have finished it tastefully without making it another of a rash of films released by Hollywood that promotes homosexuality and / or other sexual abnormalities. This could be completed with a "pay-off", but there were other motives behind the pen. What matters is that the mud hit your face after you have seen the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Yes, I'm just another Puritan. This homosexual content smashed the whole movie. I would not positively judge a film for artistic or entertainment value if the only purpose was to promote a political motivation, more for this.
