Let me get it right ... "The Church" has a security lock mechanism to keep spirits from going, but the ultimate solution brings it to the ground? LOFL! Maybe I'm missing the plot. Maybe this guy from Ed Wood School is film-making or something. This movie is about as useless as the church itself. Hi ... maybe that's the point. The whole Rosemary's Baby-esq segment was hilarity. I can go to my corner Halloween costume shop and get better features than that. The whole movie must be restored. Correct. There were so many things being played down ... so many things that could make me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling. I am not sure if the error lies in writing or editing, but what I saw should not have this high in a review.
