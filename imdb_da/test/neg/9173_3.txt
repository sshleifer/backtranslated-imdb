What can I say ... not much to this at all. Pretty boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Actors performances are just OK. The only one shining in any way is Simmons, but he has only, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that keeping his screen time to a minimum keeps him the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel his talent was wasted. No other step over mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems to be exciting in the beginning, but then it just doesn't go anywhere. There wasn't a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like I just saw something special. The cinematography was pretty bland ... I mean desert in a washed-out kind of sepia ... not very inspiring. The story of his childhood palace back from prison seemed only partially thought out and did not 'I really add something to the story, except to make an average' Twilight Zone 'script for a full length feature. <br /> <br /> Killing.
