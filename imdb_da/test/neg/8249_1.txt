Sappy. <br /> <br /> I liked how they went to "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books on each other to impress the ugliest girl there. <br /> <br /> Probably the guardian of my school is a Genius too, but is waiting to land the big construction work. <br /> <br /> Just because you hold your nose to the gatestone, there's no reason to try to cut a steak with it. "Do you like apples?" <br/> <br /> The guy nods or something. "Well, how did you like them APPLES!" Wow, that's genius. <br /> <br /> Duh, Minnie Driver would give his number to anyone. Robin Williams can't paint and keep the good books on the top shelf. And there is a professor who always carries a priest's star for no reason.
