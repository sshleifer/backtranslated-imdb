It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I'd like to add this rather unclear movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman enters these mediocre movies? Judas Kiss boasts several amazing actors, an interesting plot and exciting twists, but its strange visual wanderings and crochet editing ruined what might have been a major crime drama. Many scenes seem to lack important information to explain the character's actions: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? Why did he miss the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly couldn't tell if the director meant Judas's Kiss should be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. Why else would he throw in a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene for the first two minutes (the little surprise made me scramble for the remote since my kids played nearby!)? Has he deliberately instructed his two prominent English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such terrible New Orleans accents? As Alan Freak I allow, I still believed Mr Rickman was sexy: in a shaken, tired, take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in way. <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a good movie, but it has some exciting moments, but I do not recommend it unless you try to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
