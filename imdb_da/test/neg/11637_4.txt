I enjoy science fiction as much as the next man ?? But what the hell was that? Apparently shot in just three days of excess film stock back from his previous movie, 'Nana (1926)' 'this Jean Renoir short is a confusing futuristic satire produced on a budget that could not have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, after a great war, Africa has become the most civilized region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been termed "Terres Inconnues (unknown land)." An African explorer ?? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man if you follow me ?? travel to Paris ruins in his spherical plane and land outside a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and her main companion, perhaps the most frightening monkey man costume I've ever seen. The wild as part of a bizarre sexual initiation ritual begins to show the explorer Charleston the dance that he is happy to learn. It doesn't help the movie as Hessling, who was wonderful The following year in Renoir's 'The Little Match Girl (1928)' is not much of a dancer, although the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Moreover, I am totally shocked that Renoir would utilize his own wife as such an overtly sexual object? It will not come as a surprise to learn about their divorce just three years later! On the plus side, I resembled the general sci-fi concept behind the movie, and the hilarious satirical touch of turning the roles of races is typically typical of such stories as this. But why Renoir decided to dress his black actor as a minstrel would remain a mystery all the time. Silly, raw and utterly meaningless, 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is a cinematic oddity from one of the cinema's most respected directors, and that is perhaps an attempt he would have liked to have forgotten. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of pieces from Dmitri Shostakovich.
