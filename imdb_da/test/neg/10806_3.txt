When a film's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen's younger, lesser-known brother stars in it, you know it won't be a really good one. "Soultaker" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-year-olds who are persecuted by an angel of death. It's a silly movie, but it's pretty entertaining, and even a bit cheap in the stupid. <br /> <br /> The reason in the movie is very small and stretched as far as it can be. Joe Estevez is not much of an actor, so fortunately for the audience he has very few lines and his role in most of the time just he goes. This movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise, as it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each die one at a time ... will anyone live? Who really cares. Although it sounds like I hated this, I didn't. I just didn't like it very well, but I was interested in most of it, so I guess that matters. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
