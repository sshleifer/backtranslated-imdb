I'm usually a fan of Bruce Willis, and despite him playing the cold-hearted professional killer, I believed him the most appealing sign here. That said, his character makes such a mess in his professional activity, it is unbelievable that he has not been caught before. The reason is thin to the point of being invisible. The end was no less annoying and insulting to the fact that it could have been predicted from approx. 20 minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> ** spoilers follow ** In Hollywood morals, the good guys always win with a few accidents along the way and the bad ones or at least are heading for justice at the end. The film's breathtaking insult is the way in which our IRA terrorist, who has somehow become a spoken, calming personality, has to move on to a new life. Like his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the bigger villain? The former (and as far as we can tell, unjustified) terrorist or the hired assassin? I don't see much to choose from - in fact or in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
