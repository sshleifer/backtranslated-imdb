The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips for Joe Cocker's music: You can leave your hat on! It was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; only the song. I'm not saying it was a terribly bad movie, just not so good. Disappointingly so! <br /> <br /> Especially when the exploration of men's and women's sexuality could have been extended. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of desire, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it, its heels are unclear from one idea to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her at the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unbeatably rattled on the bizarre experience with John John's sense of humor, but less rumbling on his sexual exploits involving the eternal willing Liz; And as a reader mentioned that for a woman to enjoy sex, she has to experience the dangerous side is compelling. This "dangerous" side is not exploited enough in the movie, and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the point of view that it could all go awfully wrong. The theme of bondage often looks, but only takes one to the brink of danger, and then it goes well. Is the movie that sends out the message that this kind of "prelude" is fine! If the film made a point about bondage pitfalls and in the wake of the ugly branches of sad masochism then it might make a good moral point. Instead, the movie jumps from a "sizzling" scene by Rourke feeding Basinger and blindfolding her to another. In a movie that could have been good, it falls flat on the face because it does not expand and expand the themes that the movie might be trying to relate to; for me it doesn't have a plot or theme just a mix of ideas.
