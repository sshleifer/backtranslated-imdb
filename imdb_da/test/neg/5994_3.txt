I like most of Full Moon Pictures, so I ordered this movie from the US because in Germany you can't get it anywhere. I thought it would be as sweet and entertaining as the subspecies or puppetry series because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was happy when the movie finally came. <br /> <br /> But after watching this cheesy movie, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can't even say actors) are boring and unbearable. The story was a poor performance and even the set and monster were very cheap and miserable. I hope that no one will ever make a sequel or remake of this horrible movie. :-)
