It's hard to imagine anyone making a Tom Cruise movie looking good; hard actually, but this makes him look good. Very good. In fact, it makes him look like Sir John Gielgud, who celebrates a very good recording day with a bravura performance. The action from the whole ensemble struggled to rise above risible and failed. The error was partly that we were fair that the plot had so much resemblance to the HG Wells original as the slaughtered carcasses of the human victims in the movie to their living predecessors: both became the blood and violated the remnants of more attractive predecessors. But to describe a plot like this to be a little sacred is to say about Colander "My, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable mass of holes" unless it is holes that are your bag; in which case this movie will praise you. <br /> <br /> The error in the second part was that they were demotivated, jobing, DVD players who knew well, assuming this was their show that would win $ 5 DVD shelf. And overpriced on that. <br /> <br /> So should you see it? Why yes, of course you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.
