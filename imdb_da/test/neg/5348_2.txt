So many good actors, so worth a look. But with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, I do not hold it to anyone on the screen. Although flawless, the book was one of Grisham's only ones I really liked, especially how it caught the taste of a deep southern city, a slightly different world to a coastal city like myself. I also loved the facts of the case, the naturalness of what happens in the book. In the film, a "nobility" is characterized by personality that seemed so stolen. The sheds and the foils are flat and one-dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, authenticity and authenticity are strikingly absent, and each item must be delivered via sledge hammer to the median section. So preachy, stuttered and superficially about such a terrible tragedy, I wish someone would remake and get the story a little more right.
