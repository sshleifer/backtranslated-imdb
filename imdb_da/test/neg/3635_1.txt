This TV show is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of its aspects. First of all, the setting is. All the characters go to PCA, this incredible boarding school with painted stylish dorms. The campus seems to have no reasonable rules - for example, the boys are often seen in the girls' dorms, and vice versa. But it can simply be because the dorm counselor, a silly person, who basically drills the viewer instead of entertaining them, as I suppose her purpose should be, sits and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this performance. Next characters. I was so disappointed to find that Nickelodeon was not creative at all with the personalities of this show. They are all represented on characteristics that are exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is apparently perfect in everything she does (see, characters, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is the jocke, Logan is the arrogant scream that pretty much nothing but aggravating all the characters as well as us bad viewers, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight-As, Dana was the hard girl, Quinn is the unrealistic "smart kids" that they consistently make fun of, Chase is the guy who is afraid to confess his "true feelings" that really aggravates me as the show continues and the new girl-Lola or something - is just one second clone by Nicole. <br /> <br /> The two most important signs that aggravate me the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I do not understand Zoey's character. Of course, she was created to be the "perfect" character I said above, but she seems to be the most flawed of them all. In most of the episodes she arises a problem, so it must be solved. What is frustrating is that we must love her and think she is great when they have not even created a very realistic character at first. Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point where her character is absolutely insulting. The impression I get from Nick about her character is that 'geeks' and 'geeks' are people to laugh at, to criticize, to mock. In the spring break episode, they did a year ago, they introduced two geeks, which the characters had to do 'cool'. I found this very offensive and stereotypical. What kind of message is Nick sending to these kids? Is it: Should it not be good at school, not get good grades, do not study hard - you become a geek, and we will mock your profession in future TV shows! Because it's definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters, and it's a terrible message through and through. All I can do is hope that Nick one day realizes that putting the intelligent peoples into our world doesn't make them good.
