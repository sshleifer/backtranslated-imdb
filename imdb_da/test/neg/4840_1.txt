The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie. There is of course a first time for everything. In many ways, this film proves that oaters are not as easy to make as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who came with it was probably Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked that something indefinite for our American psyche and panache. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. I can see now why they changed the original title from "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". It tells me that the producers and the director had no basic understanding of a western one other than the standard shoot'em scenes and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same about US executives trying to make a Polish movie while not failing in the process.
