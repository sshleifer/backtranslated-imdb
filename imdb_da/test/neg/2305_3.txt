Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels that all involved sex and melodrama, and some of them were actually made for movies, including this effort, and they all have the distinction between being some of the worst movies ever made. The story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and calculating for everyone around him. He's a playboy of the worst kind by using and then throwing each woman off of him, including the wife of the IBC network president. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is responsible for the television network IBC and when his younger wife Judith takes a look at Robin, she doesn't waste time to get to bed with him. Greg gets sick and has to take some time and this is where Robin enters and starts trying to run the network, but overall a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler), who is in love with him, kills. When Greg returns to his job, he tries to get rid of Robin by using the moral clause in his contract when rumors begin to fly over his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), a gay photographer. <br /> <br /> This was conducted by Jack Haley Jr., who continued to be a very successful television and movie producer, but it was only his second movie director and the material he was forced to handle, seems to be way above his head! The script comes from Susann's novel, and that is probably why it looks like a cross between "Alfie" and "The Dollar's Valley" and I think why her books could never translate well into movies because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake Take her stories seriously instead of the tongue in the cheek. With that, the laughs that come from this are unintentional, especially during the completely ridiculous fight towards the end of the movie, which starts when Cannon refuses to give the slave bracelet back to the gays! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is all over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst bearings in history and using the term "chic" in every other sentence. Law was not the original choice for the lead, but another actor who was thrown had a serious accident, and the law came in and delivered one of the several tree performances that side of Miles O'Keeffe. The movie's script suffers in two different areas, being both completely silly and terribly boring, and it will test a viewer's patience if they choose to see it. One has to wonder what would be the result if an instructor decided to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously, because the experiment here is cumbersome and ridiculous.
