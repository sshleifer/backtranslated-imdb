An amazingly beautiful Charlotte Lewis star like a woman terrorized by a ghost that plagues her on the phone. The drive to the edge in fear Charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery to save her hygiene and her life. I cannot believe that Ruggero Deodato, the director of "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park", directed this absurd piece of waste. Goblin's front man, Claudio Simonetti, is quite good, but that story is painfully stupid. The manuscript of Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and it makes no sense, the play is bad and there is absolutely no excitement. The scene where a future rape of Charlotte Lewis is killed by coins broadcast from a metro phone is more than ridiculous. Don't waste your time with this piece of shit. There are far better Italian horror movies out there!
