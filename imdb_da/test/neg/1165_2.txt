I just watched this movie and it turns out to be rather lame as mentioned by other user reviews and the only thing that bothered me most was the southern accent some of the characters had, it took place in Wisconsin, not south. As mentioned from other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big guy, so why does the guy playing Jason and Leatherface portray him? <br /> <br /> I quickly jump through most things, there are many slow parts. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will do their homework at Ed Geine and the city and make a more precise movie
