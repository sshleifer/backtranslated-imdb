My friend Zac rented this movie for free when his mother works at a rental shop. I still feel ripped off as I will never be able to get the 100 minutes of my life back. Having seen the first "Dark Harvest" the night before this show, I expected at least to see a crappy remake of the first movie. Wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no single scarecrow in the movie (unless you count one of the box covers) and there are no real death scenes. The film received its R-rating from an 8-year-old girl who screamed "god d ** n" with her father. <br /> <br /> There is no tequila that could make this movie viable. Believe me, we tried.
