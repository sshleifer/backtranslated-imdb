Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters") earlier, I counted on Mirror mask to be safe and very disappointed. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was exciting enough. The relationship between the characters was credible and easy to understand, and I loved the sets, costumes and Helena's art. However, the subsequent computer-generated scenes were scary. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and CGI scary. Events occurred for the flurry of reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to what might be. I only watched the first 20 or 30 minutes of the movie, so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend that you don't see anything at all and stick to Gaiman's strong writing.
