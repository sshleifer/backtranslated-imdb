So this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment. After the paperwork is finished, the psychiatrist says, "I'll show you ink blots. Tell me what you see in them." "Well, says the patient," looks at the first, "I see a man and a woman having sex." When he sees the other, he says, "I see two women having sex." When he sees the third, he says, "I see two men having sex." When he sees the next, he says, "I see two men and two women having sex." The psychiatrist puts the ink blot down. "So," he says, "we're starting to discuss your monomania." "My monomania?" says the guy. "And you with all those dirty pictures!" That's how this movie hits me.
