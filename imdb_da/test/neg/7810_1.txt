I was fascinated by the unpleasant managerial character that I am myself and the actual boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger Ashton Kushner, but this movie is so pueril I had to turn it off. It was a waste of time to see it. When people started throwing the whole room, it was too much to see. Painful, horrible crap film. If they had just toned it down. Are there really people out there who find it fun and like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers rated it so low. Career since the story was exciting as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor. I liked the part. Also the opening scene with colleagues on the train was cool, as I like his colleague's characters. If you can stomach non-sense movies or you are pretty young, it may be one you can stomach.
