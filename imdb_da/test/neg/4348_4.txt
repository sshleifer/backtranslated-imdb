It is a shame to throw such a good idea. The main idea of ​​philosophy is to enter past lives, which - fortunately - are not a time journey, but a journey into the human being that has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Maybe they shouldn't be called by life in the movie now, when I think about it ... Another minus, I think). It's all in the present, in another room ... Very interesting without causing much religious distress. But the music is completely repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and out of place (not to mention "western"!). There should have been more variation and more thought of where there should be music and where there should be. The retreated romantic scenes take a lot of space and time and are completely unnecessary. The action is not bad, even though the language has prevented me from understanding better. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needed a little more thought, development, and expression. Interior scenes might have had better background settings because in many cases they seem unreal. As a whole, I would say that this movie leaves much to be desired ...
