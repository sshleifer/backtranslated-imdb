There are many different problems with the movie "KillShot". For one, there are too many coincidences. The man is a hunter and happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer appears, with some killer know. Okay, I'll take one. The child calls the real estate agent whose wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it. Okay, I'll also take one. Before going to cash, he decided to rob our killer, who didn't kill him, but decided to go with him at work. It starts to become really weak. Then they come up the same day that the man has an interview with his wife's boss. No one is there, but wife and husband have decided to make their way into the empty office. They go into the office and the professional killer assumes they are talking to the right guy. It is only in the first 15 minuets. <br /> <br /> There are many more gaps in this movie so I love to talk about. Why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agents, I don't know. Why didn't he shoot the woman on his porch, I don't know. Why he kept letting the stupid child do all the stupid movements and destroying a lot of cramps, I don't know. Why the girlfriend was even in the movie, I don't know. Why didn't he decide to pocket the gun and just leave it on the counter, I don't know. Why did they even go into the testimony program, I do not know. What I know is that the Casting Director did a good job, the photography director did very good work, Location Scout picked great places, and the production designer was worth every penny. So, my advice to anyone who chooses a script to be so well done by the crew must ensure that any attempt to kill any of the hit man is not faked at a peak through an open window.
