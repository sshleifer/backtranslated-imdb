I watched this movie at a party, we were very amazed by the end, it ended up a little poor. Although the whole movie is not too fantastic, I expected something a little better. This movie is pure garbage bin, but I suggest you see it if you find cheap horror movies with a weak script quite fun. Personally, I loved the ad, it was my main highlight, the fighting situations were basic, a shot of a knife, some shadows in a window, false blood. I must say that Granny's costume was pretty scary. This movie is a mix of kill joy, camp blood and boggy creek 2, except this movie has a little better camera wok and color treatment compared to camp blood.
