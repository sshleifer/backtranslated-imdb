Antonio Margheriti, director of the cozy cheesy cult horror Cannibal Apocalypse, strengthens this gothic-flavored giallo starring the gap-70s icon Jane Birkin (as well as her massive-conked French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bisexual French teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer attack, seven fatalities in the cat eye end a boring mess that is a struggle to endure. <br /> <br /> Pretty schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to his family's Scottish property after many years away, only to discover that a madman kills her relatives one by one. Using the full range of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways, dark corridors, creepy cemeteries, candle cobwebs covered rooms), Margheriti crumbles together a confusing story that sometimes elevates supernatural go-on, but ends with a lame cop out completes it's imaginative in the extreme. <br /> <br /> "And just where does the cat fit into all this?" I hear you ask. Well, a pretty pudgy moggy testifies to every murder and thus justifies Margherit's rather cold sounding title. <br /> <br /> 'Gory, stylish fun' claims the DVD cover; 'Drilling pile of fertilizer' says I.
