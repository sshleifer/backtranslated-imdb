A true yawner and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie or even a pretty good one, but this one is far from the mark. Charlie is busy finding out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystique is very pedestrian and the play does not go much better. The only saving grace for me in the movie was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good frightened faces, but after that the pickings are pretty slim. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and mates with Chans daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He's pretty decent, but looks as if he's exhausting to carry the movie. What I noticed most was how the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, whom I generally think of most of his entries, uses many long shots without action (like Charlie's first trip into the house from outside). Why? The movie is only 64 minutes long to cry aloud! Shots that way tell me that the director had to fill the time because the script was even weaker than he was used to. This is probably not the worst Chan movie ever made, but so far it's the worst thing I've done through unfortunately.
