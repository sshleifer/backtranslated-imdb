Realty TV crew is assigned to cover a small city high school hockey team running into a serial killer with a black mask and hoody. Lots of interviews where crew members (and some of the locals living in the White Plains town where the majority of this movie is set) talk into the camera about each other, the ones they meet in the White Plains city, their current situations, and showbiz side of their lives. The manuscript is often sour, cynical and caustic, and Killer Movie basically pokes fun on realty TV shows with a casting of characters to be found at The Real World. If this plot is attractive to you, knock yourself out. I found the signs tiring and the satire is old hat. Paul Wesley, the director who needs a great break, encounters more than he may be negotiating with Jake Tanner. He is a nice guy who comes out of very sympathetic and tolerant of the shot he has to contend with, considering the fine donnas and immature people in his affiliation who often cause nothing but migraine. Particularly irksome is his producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone, its poisonous attitude creates much excitement. She is the type of producer who wants to exploit an extension of a small town with regard to the killer using the hockey team history as a front to exploit the tragedy that occurs in white plains. Those who are familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that she has now perfected the pampered princess made it clap because it is the only role we ever see her in most of the time. As Blanca she polarizes the way she needs attention, milking the little celestial status she has for the hilt, producing a lot of friction as she becomes a source of frustration, and has the right potty (Cuoco may have only taken part so she could escape her usual TV sitcom roles, allowed to spew profanity without restriction) Cuoco, along with the entire cast, serves Killer Movie as an eye-catcher, but it's hard to find any sign you won't see hacked with a meat cleaver. Jason London is a sound / equipment guy, a real creep with a sour attitude, often bothering the others with his vicious comments that are not spoiled. We are witnessing many riot conflicts and seeing how these self-absorbed Hollywood types sneak at each other. The killer's identity should not surprise anyone, it is quite obvious. Some less gore, but most of the violence is shot off-screen. Despite some domestic lesbianism, it is not even satisfactory. Leighton Meester appears in the movie as a sweet victim. Director / writer Jeff Fisher gathers pretty attractive cast, but I wouldn't be able to distinguish it from the countless slashers who have saved the horror shelves over the last ten or so years ago SCREAM. While I have never wanted anything from Cuoco's character, I can never tolerate looking at her, but eventually she has to come up with a role that does not consist of her preaching, with slender arrogance, always whining and complaining.
