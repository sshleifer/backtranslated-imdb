Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He retains from violent action, however, as he is under instruction of the world's greatest thief, Night Fox. The team then has to pull a number of hoists back to pay Benedict back while testing their abilities against Night Fox who want to maintain their position as the biggest thief ever. This movie is simply a complete mess. The masses can claim that it is "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt put great performances, but they are the same people who have a subscription to "Hello" magazine and believe that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actress. The story coincides, it's not complex or clever, and it has no intelligent twists, it's just a complete mess that is wasted in several directions with the hope that the audience will think it's cool and intelligent (Hi magazine readers). However, any respectable movie guard will see the movie to the farce that it is. While Ocean's 11 wasn't a good movie, it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It's as if the director and the cast said to themselves, hi this does not work, let's just laugh! In fact, the draft looks like they enjoy themselves, but I wasn't. I will not dive into the plot as its confused development does not warrant any investigation. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts unfolds herself (with Bruce Willis going on a como role), while mildly funny seems to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The film is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied a Uzi 9mm into the film studio. There can only be credit for some scenes where Night Fox uses Caopeira to make a heist against the back of some funky music, but it is hardly fair to watch the movie. The final scene represents the team in an indecent drunk stupor; this exactly sum up the movie. Stick with the original.
