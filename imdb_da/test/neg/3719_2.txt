If this movie becomes a holiday tradition, I have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you even think about comparing this with 'A wonderful life'! It was horrible! The boy sang made his toes curly. And what on earth was the deal with his hair ?? Emmy worthy of performance?! Please. Granted, Lucci did OK, but an Emmy ????? I think this movie is a waste of money. The fact that they are stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse. It lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts. Lighting, wardrobe, makeup, it seemed everyone wanted to go home. Just a big NO from me.
