John Wayne's most daring worshipers will cringe when they see The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty radio studio, this is a stinkeroo. Unusual for a Western, we have a criminal who is a crime for sex crime. Earl Dwire plays a half-white and Indian, for reasons not explained, pretending to be a Mexican, hokey accent and all. Dwire sounds like Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day. He and his gang are on Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really have nothing worth robbing, but Dwire will just have an excuse to kidnap Terry and get her way with her. She hears the shameful fate she has in the store, and she and Hayes flee the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where they happen to meet with John Wayne, who is on the bandit's track. They also run into a very stupid sheriff who thinks Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons I can't quite understand it. <br /> <br /> It was a tough way to make use of horse operas like these for the Duke. Fortunately, there were better things on the way.
