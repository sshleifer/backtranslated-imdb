This German horror movie must be one of the strangest things I've seen. <br /> <br /> I was unaware of any relationship between child abuse and vampireism, but it is believed to be based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb due to repeated blows in the hands of his father. He also has a doll's birth, but I can't figure out where it came from. His colleagues find out and justify him terribly. During the day, a mild bookkeeper goes to the cemeteries and funeral home at night and drinks the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course otherwise we would not care about the fact that he usually tears their clothes down to the waist. He eventually finishes to actually kill, and that's what gets him caught. As I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow, as Werner Pochath never speaks and just spends his time drinking blood.
