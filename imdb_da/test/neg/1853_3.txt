We saw this in a shopping basket at the local Asda: £ 1.50 for the DVD. reading all the hype plastered over the cover says how "hillarious" it is and it also had a really good, established cast, we thought this should be a good movie. So we bought, took it home, pushed it into the DVD player, sat down and waited for funnies to begin ....... and waited ....... and waited ..... and waited a little more. <br /> <br /> Some 90 minutes later, although it felt more like 3 hours, the credits rolled and that was the end of it. <br /> <br /> Which letdown - even paying £ 1.50 seemed a cone. God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon were thinking when they said "yes" to this tosh. And what Moran is about: Well, when I enjoyed black books, the dead Shaun and his comedy tours, I felt he was out of his depth in this movie. He tried to play too hard and probably thought that if he kept the characteristics of his Black Books character, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was withdrawn. Gags fell flat after a while, and then he just became an annoyance. It is a shame because I believe in the right part that he could be a very good film / character actor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize: the actors in the actors failed to act !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
