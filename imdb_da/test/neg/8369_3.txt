I'm kind of between the gushy review and the hat review. I've been a fan of Lovecraft (and a Lovecraft 'purist') for a long time, and while this little amateur movie had poor quality, it had a number of redeeming qualities. I went into looking at the worst I have ever seen and wondering if Lovecraft would turn it over, but I was shocked to find out that I actually liked it. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to catalog the movie's mistakes, so I mention only a few who keep this movie from being a "stellar amateur". It's a very low budget and shot on a camcorder, so it looks like some soap operas, but when you get used to the idea, it ceases to be a big deal. The direction is pretty amateur, and the shot frame and the use of the distance in the shot are pretty clumsy. STILL, this movie was actually a bit creepy, and it was more faithful to the Lovecraftian intent than almost all Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna trainees (my biggest exception to the movies that are Re-Animator and Dagon). The idea of ​​being impregnated by some old people is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which is not to say that this movie is as good as these stories !!), so the overall plot is pretty faithful to Lovecraft's ideas. One thing that annoyed me was that the words out of the Bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner disturbed and scared. I'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that "the word of God" disturbs the old or just this zombie. There was no real answer to that. The rest of the Christian symbolism in it reminds me of August Derleth's inclusion on mythos. So in a way, this was a Derleth style on mythos. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this movie as a curiosity. It shows how a rather atmospheric film can be made with almost zero budget. I liked the wine cellar setting. Outdoor shots were sad though. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same cursed shots) to convey 3 signs' long journey was really sad. The director needs to throw it upside down for that. The action was standard for an amateur movie, where the blonde zombie girl received a personal award for "Best Impersonation of Gollum by an Italian actress". In fact, I think this movie was made before the Lord of the Rings movie. Perhaps Andy Sedaris saw her and thought "Dang, she wanted to make a great Gollum!" <br /> <br /> A little kudo to the instructor, though. The makeup of the zombies was like bad goth children. I was sorry to see this and almost stopped seeing. I was like "Oh, that's how we know she is evil and obsessed", but later in the movie you see a girl painting makeup on the face of an older woman (both living). So it was not an attempt to say 'goth makeup = zombie' but rather 'goth makeup was left behind by zombification'. However, / zombie possesses "blue contact lenses" ... heh. On the whole, I've still seen this movie better than the Yuzna and Gordan movies (excluding the above exceptions). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this movie did a better job of filming a Lovecraft-like story than they did, and on a small budget. <br /> <br /> A quick word for the makeup artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but long, black snaps looked very stupid. <br /> <br /> A quick word to the writer of the score: I know you couldn't resist, and apparently neither the director who okayed it, but since the two characters square with weapons could be a "duel" , the little whistle from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" killed any mood that the scene had accumulated. It was sweet, but sweet was not appropriate. The filmmakers in this movie have read Lovecraft and had great respect for him. I enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character Carter with the bad dreams, and the character Pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.
