Faint-hearted, verbally abusive film studio manager runs his male assistant shaken with nit-picking requests, holding the young man under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; After one year of office terror, it works rigidly, eventually cracking. Writer director George Huang may have a little more than he can chew here. His "swimming with sharks" is not a portrayal of Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hard work. Instead, it is a stunt film production with a twist, a one-trick pony with tunnel vision. The surroundings do not look or feel like Tinsel Town (perhaps due to a limited budget), and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a film-making unit (it could be a real estate agency in the valley, for everything we know well). Leader Kevin Spacey, who also acted as one of the film's producers, provides a controlled and focused performance as the powerful mogul whose ego is out of control; he does good work and yet the character does not ring true. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status do not succeed with what we see; who answers this man? What drives him beyond humiliating others to sports? What projects is he juggling apart from the only script we see passed around? The movie is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated, it starts to act as a stage game padded off the big screen - yet one without enough characters or motivations in it. Perhaps Huang wanted to keep things simple, but his film instead looks like a half-baked project that needed much more insight, humor and atmosphere. ** from ****
