Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer, which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent actions. The suburbs come across as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or movie) since the 1960s - surprise surprise, the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as constructed as something you've seen. "The neighbors would never know about this guy," one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgerton's character. "But he was completely plausible with what he was. Serial killers don't have all the patches over their eyes and screech their cheeks. They look like the guy next door." Another professional in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in each way. But the real insignificance of this movie is that it is a genre movie that no one saw. Supported by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - that is the government), it was run at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI kindness for a * very * short release season. Q1: What do the JRC finance genre flicks do though they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty films (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & Co urges their creators to believe that they give the masses what they really want, as opposed to what the cultural elite in state funding think they want. The truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn much more critical recognition - and win far more unclear prices - than they are.
