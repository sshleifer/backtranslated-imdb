And one, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> That reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, both on stage and on screen. We have few chances to see her. I think this is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here she plays a sympathetic role. Not only that, but she is also very beautiful and meant to be something of a bombshell. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon does not stop with the Drummond artist's tradition. He is always reliable, but he is not much fun. He is not a rascal or a knave. Therefore, this seemed to me a spoken effort with little action or excitement. But check it out for Leighton.
