Frantic, somewhat mediocre spiritual, infantile humor abounds in this city boy beaten wannabe farmer's tale. It is not monstrous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell audience, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. The most I can praise "Son of Law" would be to say that it mostly avoids toilet humor. The biggest problem is that all the characters lack heat, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikely hero. There are a few funny pieces that involve pets, and it's about it. The story, what is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "Jury Duty" look like "Gone with the Wind". - NOTE
