This movie is filled with sentimentality, unprofessional flight that makes a pilot like me ring and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel for example? She has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, except to give her the "Follow Me" car the opportunity to run wild and collide into Dorinda's fence. It must be one of the stupid sequences among many in the movie. Another is at the end when the plane (if it was a B-26 or an A-26? -Both designation used in the movie) is left with props swirling and no chocks in place. Of course, it serves, but to reveal it would be to commit a feared spoiler. As it is, the plane would have begun to control taxi control. The ending (again avoiding spoilers) involves far too much talk - as at the beginning of audio films in the 30s with all the last speeches. Here Dreyfuss just bubbles over and over again. The ending also incorporates other radical violations of the airplane protocol and a few inconsistencies / imperfections that I will not describe. What a dull and irreconcilable effort!
