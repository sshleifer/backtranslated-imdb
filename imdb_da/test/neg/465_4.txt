I must say that I wasn't impressed with everything, probably because I expected much more from this movie. Perhaps an accent on religion vs. science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So if you expect something to think about when you watch this movie, don't do it. It is more psychological than philosophical. I'm voting 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit and because I have great respect for BBC documentaries. There are a few very interesting scenes that actually made sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it to a film related to evolution theory, too bad that this wasn't the main subject. Oh, I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is rather boring and somehow cruel.
