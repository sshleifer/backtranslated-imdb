This is not a big movie theater. The film is cliché ride and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are striking, but with the extra unlikely that the teletechnical forces are innate. <br /> <br /> I can't say I didn't like the movie because at least it went a couple of hours ... but these were passed as one would read an undemaking book on a long train journey. That book would not be a great literature, but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards, because it would interfere with the many other clichés of ridden books. Likewise, the film was okay while it lasted but may be forgotten. At least I think it is. I can't remember much about it now !!
