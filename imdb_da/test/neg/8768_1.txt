The other reviewer was quite correct about this one. The scripture was horrible, the play was terrible, the motive was terrible. The actors looked as if they were not really into the movie, just as they were almost * going to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really German for the story (or what was a story), and they were not produced particularly well. <br /> <br /> I suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can I say it?) of the other eschatologically influenced films (Omega Code, Left Behind). And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when these types of movies are produced. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially a non-Christian.
