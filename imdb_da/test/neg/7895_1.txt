I watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan and he was really really looking forward to catching the "soul" mood movie claimed to have. Boy, we were dead wrong. When I finished watching the movie, I felt two things: remorse and relief. Remorse because I regretted wasting my time watching this horrible piece of fertilizer and relief because I saw it for free on cable. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie really gives a bad name to black people, trying to spell off so much horrible stereotypes that I believe in all black people everywhere. I am Asian and I feel very sad and sick for those who made this movie. What more to say? Bad writing, even worse acting and horrible story. <br /> <br /> Even if you are bored with death and have no other choice, do not watch this movie. Seriously. The movie really has nothing to offer except if you want to see things like less illegal drinking, killing animals, breaking down women and overall: A really really bad-obnoxious-psychic-horrible movie. Yuck.
