I waited a little until I could see this Lone Ranger movie. I finally got to see it on the Lone Star Channel today and was very disappointed with the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart performed better Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Tonto, than the two stars in this movie. Very bad plays were performed by everyone in this movie. Even the plot was poor and far-fetched. I think the horse that shows Silver was the best actor in this movie. I'm glad I didn't go out and bought a copy of this movie when it first came out when I feel it's a waste of good money. I'm really sorry about the characters that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels played and brought to life on the silver screen, have been spotty so badly. Unless they find actors worth portraying the characters in the same way as Clayton, John and Jay did so well in the past, I won't spend the money to buy the movie. I don't want to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
