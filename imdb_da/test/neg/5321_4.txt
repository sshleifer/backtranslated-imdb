The 1977 animated live hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather 'Travel' as he only comes as far as Lilliput), didn't get much of a release and it's not too difficult to see why. Michel Legrand comes up with some captivating melodies, but they only inspire poets Don Black as "A simple fact remains / No one here suffers from growing pains." Richard Harris once again surrendered in his passion for excessive makeup, toning down eyeliner for too much foundation this time to hide the fact that he is at least 25 years old for the role, but at least he (perhaps inappropriate) reduces his tendencies for greater than the longevity of a performance that consists mainly of protesting whispering. The Belgian animation only looks a little better than the French children's television early in the morning, but Peter Hunt's movie is almost not as bad as it sounds Real model sets for the animated characters are back to Max and Dave Fleischer's 1939 version, while a few moments of the swiftian satire remains - although it is clearly aimed at the youngest of children.
