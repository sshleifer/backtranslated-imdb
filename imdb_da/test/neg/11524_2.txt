I rented this movie because I'm a great Dudikoff fan. I figured it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At 15 minutes notice, I started to let the others tear the DVD out and flip it back to the rental shop, but they refused. They swore it had to be better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This movie lacked everything. The actors delivered their lines with as many emotions as a comatose rock! The reason was ridiculous and I was offended that Hollywood assumed people were stupid enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T gives one of his worst performances here. <br /> <br /> Having seen pictures of the wrong plan, the bad guys stand to be shot and clips are emptied and miss everything I wanted to scream and hit my head on concrete. The movie hit its imperfect plateau when the people at the space station used a lift to travel. Space suits are not necessary and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts can say. <br /> <br /> I didn't finish this movie and hated it. I don't want to finish this movie. This is slow suicide. I could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge torture I put it through.
