What I was hoping for (or even expected) was the well-known "stop motion" imagery and extreme slow motion, extreme zoom and all-encompassing fishing eye. In short: the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way that the human eye is unable to play so that the human eye can see. The things that made the other Qatsis hits. <br /> <br /> I just wondered how the creation of everything would fit the title. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I got the feeling that the focus of this third part was on the message and not on the packaging. That's fine, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew the message, and it turned out that there was nothing else left for me. More than half of the film was solved or colored or posterior or transformed through another filter. It looks like the effects your camcorder does, but you never use it. Many of the pictures would have been more beautiful without filters, like the giraffe and the zebra hunt. One could say that 'technology or any human-based vicious source disinfected our beautiful nature', but why do these seventies effects symbolize it? At the time when there were more than 10 minutes in a row with this cheap look, I was ready to leave. The hope that the rest just couldn't be so bad made me stay. But then there was slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 images in a second, there is just not enough movement to slow down. Please record the motion-to-be-lowered faster as it was done with the beautiful shots of foaming and splashing water (some of) the laughing people and the drill song that sang soldiers. I recognize that archive images cannot be redone, but I had already seen much of the footage it could have done without it. It has been a lot of work to browse through the archive films, and the effects may not have been so easy to apply and fix. In addition, much of the work was mixed with each other. It shows that the creator was not out to prolong the movie or to save himself. But I did not like the mixed stuff a bit ... The idea behind it was sometimes nice or even wise, but the implementation was inadequate. The computer-generated images did not disturb me so much, but obsolete. The "bits" streaming along the circuit (in the first part of the movie) looked newer and was nice. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was smaller. I was happy to hear a cello play a big part in the music. Slightly less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with Glass's music, but it is a matter of taste. As is all of the above, of course. I hope there will be another Qatsi story to tell soon where computer images will have a less important role and it will inspire someone to get back into the field. <br /> <br />
