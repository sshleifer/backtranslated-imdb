The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to revive her traumatic childhood suffering (her childhood wife and violent father). Tory discovers that her friend was only the first in a series of murders still occurring. Can her mental forces help solve the crimes and stop the continued murders? <br /> <br /> You really don't have to find out because, oh my God! It was so so bad! I know that all Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth seeing. But don't be fooled. The end was predictable, the actress TERRIBLE (not even getting me started on southern accents * y'all *) and the story was trite. Just remember .... you were warned!
