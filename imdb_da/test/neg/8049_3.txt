The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many cliches it rehashes. Strange Chinese gangsters. A female vice president. A fan channel that is large enough to fit a large Caucasian man. Shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy. A situation where you have to sniff some innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scenes where you sniff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball. The Deputy Director in a nice well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese prizes shine almost practically in a dark room with just a little dim light, rather as vicious as the slimy gangsters. A lone completely left alone in a ship (building, flying, anything) spreading chaos on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons. Contract. Mv. The second best way is to count how many zeros you need after the decimal point to accurately measure the likelihood of the movie scenario. I counted up to 45. A president accepts a meeting aboard a private vessel. The impossible insurmountable command from the Nukebox. The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot them up. Contract. Man is more likely to fall into the sun than for this movie to happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie was interesting until the time the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president. Then bored boredom. Suspension of disbelief ceased, and I began to think about the fun I would have tortured this movie ...
