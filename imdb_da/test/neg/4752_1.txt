The production value of AvP2 can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> Scripture is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of ​​AvP: What are facehuggers good at Predator's ship? Why does Predator clear all the signs of his influence and than to waste precious time with procurement and even present the body of an insignificant human struggle? Why is Predator alone? Why does Predator exhibit only on the ground, but on its home planet? Why does Predator make his work so uncomfortable for himself by chasing foreigners rather than bombing the whole country that humans do in the end? Why Predator beats more and more of his few weapons rather than gathering them to hold them together after using one. In the end, he even loses his armor before he fights the Predaly in his hand to the battle: What a bad plagiarism of the first predators last battle between Arny and Predator. The predator's movements are so exaggerated that he moves more like a Japanese sumo than as a highly educated foreign safari hunter. As you can see immediately, the whole story is a mess. But it gets even worse because this engrossed job is filled with dull patchwork of meaningless interludes as a long pizza ordering episode or some detailed information on the criminal past of the two brothers (Dallas & Ricky). The sheriff is, of course, the friend of these two criminals, which he regularly puts behind bars. (not convincing and absolutely superfluous for the plot). <br /> <br /> Besides, the actor is scary. Compared to the high class of directors and actors of the former foreigners or Predator films, AvP2 is an embarrassingly bad piece of body. Finally, the film's action is really bad. There is not a single action scene where the audience can see the whole set. Each fight is filmed in short and appalling eruptions with close-up zoom at almost full darkness. This results in a horrible experience for the audience, because you can only see nothing but a dark shaking screen. <br /> <br /> I propose the two directors Strause to buy a stable camera and get a lesson in modern CG, so the next movie contains some visible actions of visible characters and may not spoil their poor management abilities on one. manner. I would advise anyone (even dying hard AvP fans) to watch this movie: prefer the first or the original Aliens or the original Predator movies, but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure.
