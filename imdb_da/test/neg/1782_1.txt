There is so much to say about this movie and so little it is good! The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are amazing, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I'm sick and tired of watching movies involving a former man and former wife thrown together in some bizarre emergency - it happens too often in movies, and it has become another bad clich√©. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that someone would have invested $ 1 in doing this waste, so don't remember $ 100 or so, it should have cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more compelling special effects on your home computer! I didn't think movies could get bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something that is more fun and comfortable, like having a tooth drawn or an enema!
