Pretty. <br /> <br /> Beautiful actresses and actors. Very bad script. Pretty frequent "let's strip our underground" scenes. Pretty fair F / X. Pretty crush location decisions (college dorm room looks like a high-end hotel room - probably because it was shot at a hotel). Pretty bland story. Pretty awful dialogue. Beautiful places. Pretty annoying editing unless you like the music video flash-cut style. <br /> <br /> This is not a guilty pleasure - it is more embarrassing. To see this, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound of the movie - you'll see the beautiful people in their beautiful black underpants and probably follow the story just fine. <br /> <br /> The cast may be able to act - I doubt anyone could look good from the lines / plot they had to deal with.
