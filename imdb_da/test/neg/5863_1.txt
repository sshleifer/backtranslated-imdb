It's possibly the only worst movie I've ever seen - it has no good features at all. It looked like it was made in about 20 minutes with the second time full of title graphics. <Br /> <br /> The leading man who was transformed from the death door to the superman - what you <br /> <br /> other than the absolutely predictable and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I left the cinema feeling cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I couldn't reccoemnd this movie to anyone
