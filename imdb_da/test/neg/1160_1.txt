PLEASE PEOPLE! DO NOT do this badly joke. The direction was completely wrong from the start. Where is the story of his mothers' emotional interference and the general madness of the original family? Why is ED portrayed as this great indulgent impressive figure full of anger and hatred? What is this crap? Of course, the author and director did not do any research into the story and would simply rely on the infamous Gein name. The fools who made this movie took so many freedoms with the truth, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant Gein movie. Go back to the less classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There is humor in that movie, and Ed is portrayed as more of the sad, lonely little man he was, according to the story. Where is the background story here? There are only badly set shocks (it's not shocking) that we've seen before and more achieved too. Take the worst Texas Chainsaw massacre ripoff and add it to the list. Had to give it one in ten because rating would not accept ZERO. I want my money back. If someone considers this movie "anesthetic", you might get a financial downturn.
