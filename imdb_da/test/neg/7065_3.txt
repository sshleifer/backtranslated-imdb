This movie starts with interesting set designs and a promising premise, but fails to provide cult movie items. Seen in a gritty parallel universe, where everything is owned by "Blump" Corporation, it is about a horrible stand-up cartoon that is successful when it grows a third arm out of its back. <br /> <br /> All the potential for great cheese is here - washed up 80's star Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, offbeat visuals and strange plot digressions, overweight women in skimpy underwear, necrophilia - but it never pays. <br /> <br /> Pacing is the biggest problem. Every scene is incredibly slow. Nelson's stand-up routines must be fun because they are pathetic not fun. But every achievement pulls on until it's not even tangentially fun, just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone who tells you the longest, weirdest joke that is imaginable, full of beautiful self-congratulations to how funny and strange he thinks it is. Imagine after a stultifying two hours of this, you never got a stroke line. You just saved yourself to see The Dark Backward.
