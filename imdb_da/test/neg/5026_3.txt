Let me say this right from the start. I don't hate this show. I actually like some aspects of it. In fact, when I first started to see it, I was quickly joined. I was just starting to get out of the whole stereotype "anime ice for kids" and the mature elements of the show had fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series and a couple of the movies, I can say that my overall disposition has changed and it falls into almost all the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime . Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on TV. At the end there was only one friend and I, and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain the plot to you. You can skip this section if you don't want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical well near his family-run sanctuary. When the kagome comes out of the well again, she has been transported back in time to the feudal era in Japan. She meets with many other characters, and they make up a group of five or in there companions, who embark on a raising / justice / groping in a sign case =). Overall, they try to restore the pieces of the sacred gospel screen that reinforce the power of demons using it. <br /> <br /> While there are many, many side stories and story arches, there is no near enough material to record 167 episodes. The only story arch that is interesting enough to see is still kind of boring (the band of seven). After halfway marking in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and who made the series decided instead to lay dozens of dozens of stuffing episodes. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no impact on history, and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters that had an important role in history will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. Many episodes follow exactly the same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. Inuyasha shoots guns at the enemy. Windscar deflections. Signs are given in horror. Enemy turns out to have a barrier. Characters used three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally fired a sacred arrow on him, and he turned to dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** MAJOR SPOILER: THE CONCLUSION MUST BE FULFILLED ** The lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** MAJOR SPOILER OVER ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent. Still, reused animation cells breathe most action scenes, and it is very difficult to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same stone has flown past a character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> On the brighter side, however, all the characters are very well developed and the romance between some of the characters was truly captivating. Also the design design (look) was brilliant and sometimes among the best I've seen, especially with the band of seven. There is absolutely no lack of Cosplay options here. Yet I found myself hoping that a sign would die just as there would be some kind of movement in the plot. And some of the humor in the show between characters is used again and again. A special boy (sit boy) exists within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a major overhaul, the series seems to be dominated by the obsessed fan girls who choke on Sesshomiru and InuYasha . Bottom line: Definitely worth checking out, but it's not worth seeing the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and comfortable for anyone. But after that, it simply becomes boring and boring. Watching a TV show should never feel like a task, but in this way this series achieves just that. Don't expect much from "InuYasha" because you will only feel let down.
