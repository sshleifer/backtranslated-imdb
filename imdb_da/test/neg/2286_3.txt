Connery climbs aboard the Moore buffoon took in this stink of a movie. Throwing away everything that made Bond successful in the first place, this film further breaks down the Bond character who throws him into the Inspector Gadget category. Get Smart this is not. There is no style here, only the second rate actors perform on cheap sets. It's a shame that Connery couldn't borrow an element of the class here, but it doesn't come across. All here series of mediocrity, including Connery's bad toupee. Maybe if I was snowed in and had the choice to see "Never Never Again" and "Howard The Duck" I would choose the former. If you want the right James Bond, get a Ian Flemming novel.
