Words can hardly describe this movie. Charged with ridiculous stereotypes, a stupid plot and bad music, this movie lacks in virtually every category. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the IMDB credits. This is not a Michael Dorn movie. He is a secondary character in the Grand Scheme. <br /> <br /> Also listed in Credit is an actor named "Prince" - which makes me wonder if it is the same artist who was previously known as .... Then again, I am is not sure this movie is worth watching just for it. <br /> <br /> Big summary ... lots of teams ... you have kidneys ... you have $ 35,000 .... you have an "illegal substance" .... and one has $ 350,000. Add some confusion and mixups about who should meet who, avenge themselves on being taken, and such, and you end up with this mess in a movie. <br/> <br /> Given a choice, I would forward this movie.
