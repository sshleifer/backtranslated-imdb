In yet another case of misleading marketing, this movie is included in a 10-movie DVD set called "Women Who Kick Butt", but even in its original cover, Shannon Tweed seems to be in action. In fact, during most of the movie, Tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character to be rescued by the male leader, and even when she is trained in jungle warfare, she must still be dragged by him! There is a female rebel who is a stronger character, but she is mostly in the margins of the movie. The male leader is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally I think) funny moments (like when he gets electrocute). The action scenes are poorly directed and badly acted: some of the stuntmen needed a few lessons on "how to get shot and die convincingly". I suppose if you are in the right mood, you can find some things in the "Firing Line" to laugh at (at some point we can hear Tweed speaking, but her lips do not move!) But mostly I was just bored me.
