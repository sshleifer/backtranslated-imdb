TANDEM is a strange piece in the Japanese pink genre, as it has the necessary sex scenes and misogynistic tones that are anything but required for these types of movies - but also throws in a contradictory drama / dark comedy story similar to what it has was better suited to another type of film. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with two lonely guys in a restaurant - each daydreaming about a previous sexual encounter. One is a mutual subway groping, the other a fairly typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. The two pervs meet and start talking after borrowing the other a cigarette. They hang out on an evening and talk a little about their respective sex lives. The movie is inter-cut with flashback scenes of both men's interactions with the women who are central to their lives. The two men have a rash and the film ends in a strange but predictable note ... I really don't know what to do about TANDEM. The sorta comes out as a soft-core, 'odd pair' type of anti-mate movie, but does not really explore the subject to a satisfactory degree. Also, there is not much of the typical extreme wear resistance that is often so prevalent in these types of films - so I can't really figure out what the meaning was. Nor can I tell whether the movie should be fun, depressing or both. I think TANDEM could have had some potential as a more serious drama movie with a dark comedy side - but as a soft-core sex movie trying to be too "smart" for its own good, it just doesn't work. Can't say I hated this one - but can't say there's something remarkable too. 4.10
