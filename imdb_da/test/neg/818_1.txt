After seeing this piece of shit you will know why limeys are running on the left side of the street ... this movie is an absolutely NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if this is the right word for it ...) are mostly understandable (about 98%) and miss any punch line at all. Save your money and stay full. You like this movie being wasted, maybe!
