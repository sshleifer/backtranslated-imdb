I guess I can see why critics give this movie two out of five stars, it's not great, but I think it's worth seeing, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by Thousand, Night at the Museum). The 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in Midlands Frankie Muniz) often relies on his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not make his creative writing, he will fail his entire semester and must repeat the character in the race of summer. So he completes his work, but he gets a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who hit him on his way to school, and he leaves his paper with the story "Big Fat Liar" in the car. He finds out a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and makes it a big movie, so he and his best friend Kaylee are on a mission to prove Jason is to even tell the truth. Of course, Marty is too ugly and slick to give Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call and he also burns the "Big Fat Liar" paper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as sacred as possible until he agrees to call Jason's father. They put blue dye in their pool and orange hair color in his shampoo, and much more naughty pranks create chaos for Marty's career. There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he will give up, but calmly, any sign that despises Marty helps in the final operation, and with Jason's parents he finally proves his truth, and boy does he deliver , great style. Also contributing to Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong . Muniz likes, Byrnes shows a very surprisingly talented support, and even though he is wasting time and talent, Giamatti is great at being uncomfortable. It's a kids movie so if it seems corny, cheesy or predictable, just remember it and try to enjoy performances and slapsticks. Okay!
