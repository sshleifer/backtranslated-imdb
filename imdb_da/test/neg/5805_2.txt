Positive ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight continue in these kind of movies, they can submit their retirement papers and collect full-time social security. <br /> <br /> While the idea that a 35-year-old video game swinger loses his opportunity and is forced to move in with Grandma Roberts and borders Jones and Knight, it is stupidly treated. Imagine the 3 bags that are high on things grandson Alex has left in their homes, and Jones goes to bed with someone who can qualify as his grandson! <br /> <br /> The video game sequences are as stupid as the rest of the movies. The assortment of characters that Alex works with is unbelievable as he enjoys his weed habit with the others. Terrible describes best this miserable movie.
