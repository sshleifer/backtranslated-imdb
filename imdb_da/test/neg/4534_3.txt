This movie had some fun moments. Louie, the protagonist was well thrown with some other decent supporting characters. The film's opening picture set the tone, but the direction and history went downhill from there. Apart from a twist at the end (interesting and fun too), I wish this movie had a better direction and a more developed story. Without giving away any of the plot, the whole idea is better! I just wished it was done better in this short movie. The potential was there, but it just didn't deliver the goods.
