This should be one of the WORST movies I've seen. I tried to like this movie, but they managed to clear almost every aspect related to this movie! Cheap dialogue, no sign development, no excitement, not enough history to pull you in, no action except for some really cheap scenes. It seems that they tried some things on the set and said to each other: "Hey, it looks a little cold why not put it in there," then the instructor probably said "Yes .... Yes it's genius!" and came back to snorting cola or something. When it comes to acting, I think the only person who TRIED to make the movie is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it is all for nothing. Because this movie SUCKS !! 2.10
