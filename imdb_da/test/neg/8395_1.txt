This movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish I've ever seen. this is slow, plot less and boring. the filmmaker deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of accidental comedy, one of which was Jared, who was a strange camp. Raised many laughs, but also many yawns. don't look with anyone at any time anywhere. If you hate someone, they recommend buying or renting it. a great waste of time and money. Thank you Gus Van Sant ... not. I can't think of anything else to say except Never watch this movie, it will make you jump out of a rock. Hope Gus and his friends read this comment before it's too late, and he makes a sequel or another disaster with what seemed to be shot with a camera phone.
