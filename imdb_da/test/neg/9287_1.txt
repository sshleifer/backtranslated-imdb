I really like Lawrence and be in Australia, I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this on my video store I thought, yes, I take a look. I wish I hadn't seen it now. Of course, Lawrence had a deep experience that opened his mind, and I think he would share it with others, but it was neither time nor place. This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I think the catch phrase of the night was "driving it until the wheels fall," as he interfered with just crazy jokes that revolve around sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me, I'm not doing I don't mind raw humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift of classifying it in fashion by Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was simply incredible, the only time I laughed was when he revived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were minus points, I would give them ....
