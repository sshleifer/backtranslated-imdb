A movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional players do. In general, I think movie-goers are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most modest reasons. Just watch a few minutes of "Cheerlader Massacre" and trust me you will change your views. A raid would be almost a compliment to these no-talent actors. But then again it is a Jim Wynorski movie. Wynorski is a popular director of these ultra-low budget B films (has worked with Roger Corman many times). The problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot. And when you have actors delivering lines as if they are reading letters from an eye view, how should I take care? In Wynorski's "Just Wench 2" he did not try to develop a plot. He simply tried to make a softcore porn / goofy takeoff on the "Blair Witch Project." It was fun and it was titling. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are a few compulsory female nude scenes, but they are few and far between. So it is not even worth enjoying at an erotic level. I must say, the worst scene is the one where Nikki Fritz crosses a bridge that is about to break. First of all, her character did not need to cross that bridge. Second, as the bridge begins to break, rather than trying its best to run over, she just stands there and seems helpless. And top it off, we don't actually see the bridge crash because the filmmakers made this a budget of $ 2 !!! Unlike many B-horror films, this one is boring. And that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the movie (though certainly no more than halfway decent). He was fun in "Just Wench 2" and also had some fun scenes in this movie.
