Some people may remember Mrs Russell from films such as "Black Widow" which had some appeal and critical recognition. Boy, she really must have needed a rent control when she signed up for this dog. Yes, there will be those who like the free violence and nudity. But one has to sit back and wonder in retrospect what possessed someone to spend money and time to do this in the first place. I just watched this movie on one of the "HBOs" and I can't believe they've downloaded it. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Mrs Russel did not have the physical appeal she made earlier in her career. But come on! Does she play Ma Barker ??? Her "sons" all look as though they could be her brothers. It is also scary because you think there will be incestuous relationships that occur (thank goodness that is not, hope that does not count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milan in the cast, this B-movie is 'straight to video' all the way. The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, either personally or on the phone, are a primer in horrible, horrible acting. Oh, wait, I forgot horrible, horrible writing too. Critique this up to experience. A bad experience.
