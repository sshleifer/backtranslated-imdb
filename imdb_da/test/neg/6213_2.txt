This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. I wouldn't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories that aren't so funny. There are several signs in the movie that are so important at first, and they disappeared right from the story. He just tries too hard to fit everything for 2 1/2 hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is only an extended version of "Hitch", padded with many more characters and dancing. <br /> <br /> If this is the best movie this couple ever made, then I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in any of his past.
