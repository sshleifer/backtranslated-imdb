I woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing and I liked getting a movie, something new, a horror movie maybe? Like many other reviewers, I came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper. The front cover is great and the commentary on the back is fascinating - 'it will scare the crop out of you' ... oh how I look back at such naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of the many things that are frightening than this movie is the play of these actors. I think no, I actually cried when they were turned up by these "scarecrowers" who had some classic costume on costume. I used to drive quite quickly past cornfields when I found them to be quite scary at night, but after watching this movie, I almost wet myself (through laughing so much) right at sight. <br /> <br /> I have seen the scarier omelet quite honestly, not my self, I am a dab hand on cooking the omelette, and if anyone links this movie to my omelet, let's just say I would create a situation where they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If anyone has any good corn (non-pop) movies they can recommend, feel free to let me know. It's a good comedy, if nothing else, OK, it's nothing else. Enjoy, but a little advice - before you press the play button on the DVD player, throw it out of the window.
