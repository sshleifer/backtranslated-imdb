I hate and despise this movie and the filmmakers behind it. <br /> <br /> I'm sure to make a hard-hit and honest movie about youth and youth culture. 1987's "River's Edge" is an excellent example of a well-made teenage drama. But what I take exception to is the infantile, grubby and sensationalist approach taken by the decision-maker in "2:37". <br /> <br /> An excellent example is how it raises so many problems and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a decision on one of them. <br /> <br /> My second major issue with this movie, except for its complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sants' "Elephant" (surprised by Van Sant not sued) is its "bull-solving in a china store's attitude to fairly delicate issues as incest and especially suicide. In short, this film is avoided as the plague and all that this filmmaker ever involved in. I have heard that his motivation to make "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. Having seen the substandard result, it doesn't surprise me at least. This is a glorified student movie exercise that has no place to be in the cinema or on DVD. Clean and simple.
