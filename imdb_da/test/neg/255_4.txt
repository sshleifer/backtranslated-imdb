I am in two thoughts on the following, film debut by Christopher Nolan. Part of me admires it to cost $ 6,000 to make, but some of me hate it for being an art house. In many ways, it reminds me of the cult movie PI, a movie I didn't like, and I can't get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be the author of the people around. Wouldn't it be more logical for someone who would be the author to sit in front of a keyboard and write? <br /> <br /> Oh yeah I guess the following gives indie filmmakers hope that just because they made a no-budget movie that cost $ 6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment but you have to wonder if this movie would be so deliberate if it wasn't made by the director of MEMENTO?
