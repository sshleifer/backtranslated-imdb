I think it would have been a more appropriate title for this movie as it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS big box shape and was very excited. I just love to find old slasher movies on VHS, because the cover art work is amazing. Although it turns out that the film itself is less than amazing. Prey is one of those films. To be fair it started OK, with the killer stalking cliché teenagers in the woods. The heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that makes you excited as you see. This movie is basically a big fat cliché, and when the "Bullet Stories" section rolls in, the movie takes a new direction and spends nearly half the maturity on the murderer's back story. In fact, I thought this was a completely original idea. However, the background ends abruptly and shows us some stock footage of a burning forest area (the lack of budget really starts to show now). Then we return to the stupid teenagers who are picked in the forest. The killer himself is not shown to the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective-looking killer. Black of Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As for gore, there is not too much, even though there is an OK face crossing at the end. <br /> Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than slasher completists - it really is a big mess.
