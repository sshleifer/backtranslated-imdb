Its obvious ESPN drools every time Knight is in the news, but should they make a freakin movie about him? This was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie I've ever seen. It had it all: horrible plays, horrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc. It looked like it was shot on a $ 10 budget. Cummon, what about the stage scenes? Were they in a high school? And the lighting, let me just say that it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a break. Denehey looked like ... Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost much credibility with this flop attempt. They poured millions of dollars into advertising, so the premiere was a big disappointment. Bob Knight is not a topic that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. ESPN blew it. Even Knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.
