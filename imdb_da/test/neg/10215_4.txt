Remember, it should not be, but it is. As a bit, I saw this movie in the theater (Being a great wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I can remember from the night is that we were the only ones in the theater and that I didn't really like it much. I blacked the rest out and for good reason. A bad movie on a par with greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling. Perhaps the effort is not so high ... and frankly, I feel dirty, just to call these people "professionals" on something. And really, apart from the first scene, there is no wrestling to talk about. So I assume that the film is about the marginally low effort world for amateurish slog-the-c *** - out-of-people. That sounds good, right? Hulk Hogan plays Rip, WWF champion. (Never let it be said that Hulk Hogan was typecast, this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the boundaries of his talents). In essence, he plays himself, but with a wardrobe that is more black and blue than Hulkster's red and yellow. He also has this gesture he does. It's like the ozzy devil sign people do on rock concerts, except that you keep your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger. My friend claimed it should look like an "R." Try and see for yourself. If it looks like an "R", then Mars needs women. Yet. Kurt Fuller, with his overactive detector of course on the fritz, plays a TV exec with his slightly homoerotic heart that puts on getting Rip, apparently bigger than Elvis, on his network. He won't have any of it (And sends the office with a triumphant gesture to no one but the camera), and then follows the movie Fuller trying to increase ratings and get back on Rip. He does it when he creates his brilliant designation "Battle of the Tough Guys." Marketing genius, this guy. From the many gestures to the rather idiotic battle scenes (Everyone played as if wrestling is very real and fatally serious) to the overactive, to the overly frequent shots of the Hulk in nothing but undies, this movie has everything you ever want in a silly movie. It is moody, not for taxation of mind, violent, and contains the phrase "What is the smell?" "Dookie" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> A classic all the time.
