I went to watch this movie last night at the National Film Theater in London as a birthday deal. It was the first time I've seen it, and I think it has now overtaken the terrible "Twister" as the worst movie I've ever seen. Rude without reason, self-indulgent and full of imaging that oscillates from crass and obvious to the unclear and incomprehensible, not very beautiful or ugly shot, I really do not understand why this is considered classic, homosexual or otherwise. I usually enjoy movies that push boundaries or even movies that are hard to see because of their length or unusual movie. But it was really, really terrible.
