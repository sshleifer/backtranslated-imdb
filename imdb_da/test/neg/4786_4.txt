It seems that people are attracted to shows that show pathetic life that has no purpose whatsoever. For me, I give my sincerity to NBC for their hard efforts to make new television changes, making fun of free play. They always seem to find great success, like The Office. When I first began to see it, it seemed to me that it might have the potential to be a smash. But after a few episodes, I really wanted to go to church and donate every penny throughout my bank to pathetic people exhibited in these low, poor and shameful areas. And the end where they show Earl and the brother in bed together, it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people struggling to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society is like. I just think I'm always being disgusted when I see the bad people in this show live in. It's like Venice Beach in California, beautiful but so many hobos. Believe me I am also not a nice guy, middle class and not a pure freak nor a bit sloppy, but it just seems to me that the show just can't look out of all the cruel, schmuck people out there who have a leg I just wanted wish they would show a little more class, not all the dirt and poverty and trailers and just below average, it just seems to drown me. For me, this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life, what not to be. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because these two apparently do not have an ounce of smarts. This is a schmuck u-mentor.
