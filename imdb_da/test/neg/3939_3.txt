Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie, see this I guess. It contains all the "scary parts where nothing happens", "the nerd type that is actually not killed", "boy and girl coming together and surviving", "facing an old fear of children" etc. I can continue. I wanted to watch this movie because I learned the mix of a video game and a movie would work. Guess I was wrong. Which makes the movie more tolerable? It's only 1 hour 17 min, so if you're bored, it might be a good idea even if I'd rather be bored. Why definitely not see it? Frankie Munitz aka Malcolm is just annoying as the nerd type. I could beat the guy, and it's so sad that he didn't die before and finally he comes back. See something else!
