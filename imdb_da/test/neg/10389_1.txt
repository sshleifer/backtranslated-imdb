Even worse than the incredibly boring "Exorcism of Emily Rose". It started decent, and right up until the mother told dad, "I knew she was in possession," in one I told you such a voice. It was a horrible line that was badly spoken and it foreshadowed the rapid death of this incredibly bad movie. Each family member has a question from the past with the pastor. Dad starts accusing everyone of either suffering his wife or actually having an affair with her and culminating with him and killing his buddy, so even in the obvious instant ease after he understands that his friend had not slept with his wife after all. People die, others come in possession, and at that time most viewers do not even break. Except for their employee Miguel, none of the characters in this movie were actually sympathetic, making it difficult to care for any of them. The action was terrible and even worse. Glad I saw it for free; even though I feel that for a movie, this bad thing is due to the money I lost.
