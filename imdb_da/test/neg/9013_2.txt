For those viewers who believed the 1979 movie "Alien", the first to depict a male Earthling that was impregnated by a vicious abroad, "The Blood of the Dead" made 21 years earlier, may come as a surprise. In this film America's first man in space collides back on Earth and after investigation is believed to be dead. He comes later again, only with half a dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his stomach. Mama (?) Alien also jumps up to fear the tiny band of scientists observing our pregnant women and she (?) Seems to have a bear and the head of Yarnek, the rock scales from a 1969 "star Trek" episode. Yet, with its short 62 minute maturity, a small group of scientists and cheap monster suggests that nothing less than a Grade Z warm to "The External Borders" (which would premier four years later) but without the fine writing that it show boasted normally. Despite the lurking title, this movie is certainly sci-fi, not scary, and offers no scary means, no laffs, little excitement and a little thought afterwards. It looks like it costs about $ 100 to make (but probably costs twice as much), and its musical score often doesn't seem to have any relation to happenings (I don't want to use the word "action" on the screen). At the end of the film many questions remain: How was our hero to feed these critters? Why should the foreigner abolish people to learn our language? (To justify the title without a doubt!) Why can't space-based foreigners land on our planet, rather than having to drive on our ships? How was our hero impregnated to begin with? It's all matters that this little cheapie can't be bothered by. It is only for the 1950s that sci-fi compliments.
