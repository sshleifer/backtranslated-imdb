It's a space, or at least I think it is. You have half-naked female prisoners in a prison of space and a monster in a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. Its Friggin Hilarious. The action is so bad that room spikes resemble an Emmy award winning movie. The story is simple. Prisoners are given the chance to reduce the sentence by examining a space station that lost contact with humanity. She finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and an angry with foreigners. She is fighting them, so on and so forth. It's a movie worth seeing just to wet your pants with laughter. If you like Real sci-fi flicks, it's a no-no, but it's a good mood set for the amateur movie maker because I can guarantee their movie is better than this.
