I'm not a fan of the original book, but I expected to see a better fit than Natalie Portman's movies, which I found horrible. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there is very little of Mrs Gregory's book in this script. The entire sub-plot of George Boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated, and in this version, George is just a flunky shuttling between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the King. I thought the title of the book referred to Maria as the lesser known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the script has periodically addressed the audience as if in notice. Apparently, this is supposed to give a bit of history and explain their motives, but it is amateurish in execution. <br /> <br /> On top of the bad script, the direction is amazingly bad. There are too many shots made with a circulating camera that is not too stable at best and quite shaky at worst. Several of the speakers are provisionally delivered as in a first exercise. The production values ​​of Henry's flamboyant court are minimal. The costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits, and others are from some costume designer's celebrated imagination. And the king, the source of all power and favors, often appears ALL. No fawning courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all people ?? I'm used to Hollywood that makes the story a fantasy, but I expected better from a BBC production. Even based on a flawless book, this production is BAD.
