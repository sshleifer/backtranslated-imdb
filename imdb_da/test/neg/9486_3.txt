This movie was okay. Mary-Kate and Ashley play the twins sister (sorry to say the obvious), sent to Paris on their will to spend the week with their rich uncle or something. <br /> <br /> Immediately two French boys who looked a little inbred start talking to them and take interest. Blah blah blah. It's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what happens between them. Still, the twins encounter a FABULOUS French model because they are in Paris, the world's fashion capital. They make bffs with the model and use a fun montage of shopping in the city of light. Yep. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't remember what happened. I think it could say something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen film" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". Overall, this movie was annoying. I mean, can I really identify at all with two girls who are destroyed after hearing that they are going to Paris? Really? Also, the jokes were really not that fun. However, I saw the whole movie. Then it had to be something entertaining. The fact that it was set in Paris was what probably kept me going.
