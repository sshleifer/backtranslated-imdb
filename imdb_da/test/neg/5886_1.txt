The baby boom was bad enough, basically making a series of all men's nightmares worse. So a few always made me feel better after a bad day, it reminded me that it could be worse. Guy was richly successful, single (smart man), and dating celebrities from singers to actresses, so his screw up of a cousin dumps his biggest mistake on him. In fact, it would have been just to care for care. I'm sure it was definitely a smart series. Oh, and what's all that waiting for the baby's change, most of it is probably a doll beyond that age, it's nothing more than a prop at least. <br /> <br /> In any case, I'm glad it didn't last for more than a year.
