This show has been performed live around the country with a large selection of castings. I first saw it in Provincetown production the first summer in P-town (2001) - before it was curious enough, banned in the overwhelming homosexual resort (the codes that led to the closure have since been changed). I saw it again later in off-Broadway, long-running production in New York. Strangely enough, P-town production was far better than New York - fresher, shorter, more exciting and fun - but it was only in the 2001 exhibition. Subsequent attempts to clone the production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely the third rate. This movie production has a Los Angelos production cast, and that's what other comments have suggested not the best. I would rate it somewhere in between the top-notch 2001 P-town production and the third-last "Just Naked Lads" P-town show last summer.
