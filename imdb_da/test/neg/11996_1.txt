When a group of stupid children (including an unlikely racist bitch) stays in an old house, it awakens four murderous Toltec spirits. Can Lash La Rue save the day? You will be able to look to the end because of the horrible comedy on the screen. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is the kind of really bad horror / comedy hybrid that Troma used to solve regularly. Things are, they didn't. release this. It does not apologize for the whole thing as it has a terrible synthesizer score (including poor attempts at Native American music and even worse "comedy" music), bad make-up effects (basically Halloween masks) and horrible appearances (Ok, the fat guy was Okay, though everyone else is horrible, and La Rue, a western film teacher, seems embarrassed to be there - not that I really blame him.) However, the worst is the comedy aspects. Sure, stupid teenagers are one thing, but when the film talks about the Toltec spirits as if they were the ultimate evil, it is only for them to turn out to be terribly annoying, dumb fools, all hope is dotted. Combination of horror and comedy takes at least some skill. There is no skill on the screen here, as everything is just stupid, and not "so stupid it's funny" either. I think "smoking potty and listening to bad Punk Rock is not I stupid" stupid. <br /> <br /> Not even a decent skinned face and a chick in small clothes can save this disaster. Horrible movie and not even worth renting.
