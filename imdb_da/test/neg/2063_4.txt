There are those who seize that this is not the opera, but then they do not stumble with the film of the CABARET, which was also not the original show. All movies of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations" or they do not work. The CABARET took more liberties with the original show than made films by PORGY AND BESS, yet it kept its original integrity, reworking the material and being considered an artistic success. The same goes for PORGY AND BESS - the processed opera for a dialogue / song libretto, because at that time the audience loved musicals, but stayed away from the few spouse operas. It would have been financial suicide for Preminger to produce a film of the opera - it would have lost a fortune for Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> That being said, it's a fine fit. The action is excellent, Oscars wins the score of Andre Previn is magnificent, like choral singing, and the individual vocal performances are incredible. Robert McFerrin (father of the popular musical Bobby McFerrin) called Porgy and Adele Addison called Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. singing his own songs in the movie, his recording contract would not allow his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded his speech (spectacular) for that release. Brock Peter's bass / baritone is extraordinary, and Pearl Bailey is his own unique self. Diahann Carroll, although a singer with fine notes, has Clara's little role which required a high soprano, so old reliable Marni Nixon dubbed his song. The Gershwin Estate hates the movie and refuses to give the musical rights even though the dramatic rights are public. This kind of hatefeud stopped in the video release of CAROUSEL for almost fifteen years (though in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in court cases) and currently both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN prevent from being released on video. <br /> <br /> Of all the stage productions given to movie versions, these are the latter two, which are the only video video holdouts. Only a letter campaign for the Gershwin Estate in NY can loosen the reserve.
