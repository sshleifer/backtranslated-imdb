This movie was really awful. But it is worth seeing as it contains the world's most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. I think this thing continued for approx. 7 - 8 minutes (repetition of the same "moves" over and over), it's almost 10% of the whole movie! I haven't laughed as hard as I laughed at it for a long time. <br /> <br /> There was some serious and meaningless outcome in this movie, but the one I found most fun was when (for no helicopter landing and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits into the complex near 2 minutes later they run out again, what the hell was that too The little white forklift, which was magically changed to a big yellow digger, was quite classic, I am led to believe this is due to that they used footage from the carnosaur trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey, I have to see them now! <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching for a laugh or two but if you Don't find bad movies fun, stay away!
