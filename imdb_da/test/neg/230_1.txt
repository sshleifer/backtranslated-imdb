Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> [warning: can be considered a "spoiler"] <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, I continued to watch my watch throughout the movie wondering when it would end. Having seen such big flicks as "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run" I was really disappointed with Disney's "The Kid." Willis plays a middle-aged man with a hard and realistic attitude to put a positive spin on people's images (he is an image consultant). An unknown child shows up. Yes, it is him, but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see him. At this point I am reminded of a cross between a bad "Quantum Leap" episode and a bad time to travel flick. Kid and Willis go through and try to figure out why he is in this time period. They find out. They meet Willis when he is older. Never remind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them to begin with how he got that knowledge to begin with how he came to the realization he needed to do this, etc. br /> Basically, it's a very tired, unoriginal, uninspiring plot that has some good actors in it. The good news is that "The Kid" actor is not nearly as annoying as he is featured in trailers on television.
