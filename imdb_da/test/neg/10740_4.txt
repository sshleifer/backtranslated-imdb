Homecoming; what a great disappointment !! After reading the plot overview (the dead come back to vote - against George W. Bush !!!!!) I couldn't wait to see this. It started interesting and it immediately became my attention. Unfortunately, it slowly fell into a dull political satire that I didn't need to see (I can just see some good old Aussie comedies for that!). There were basically only one or two scenes of horror, and they weren't even scary. I couldn't believe this came from Joe Dante, who could easily have pulled it off with a balance between excitement and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
