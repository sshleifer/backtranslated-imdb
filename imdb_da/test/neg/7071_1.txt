This movie was such a mess, I actually refunded my friends, which I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the slider. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie would be campy, but the access was so heavy-handed and self-reflective, it turned out really flat. Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man, there is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and worsened by his unpleasant and indulgent companion Bill Paxton (which I feel embarrassed about - this was a truly tasteless role for a talented actor). A freak accident changes Nelson's career course and chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Attempting humor was corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty, but he adds nothing - comic or otherwise. <br /> Overall, it is a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes like a lead balloon. At least you can laugh at Plan 9 from outer space. This just makes you wonder who thought it was a good idea to fund and film. One of the very worst bombs you'll ever witness.
