The production values ​​of this movie are detrimental to Hollywood blockbuster status, and the script shortens cult status. What is left is a tired formal attempt at the disaster movie genre that disappears with ebb time. <br /> <br /> A decent cast is either missing or not disturbed. The beautiful Joanne Whalley cannot bring gravitas to the role of police officer Nash, wearing the most annoying matching waist mechanism over her skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavy weight part of Thames Barrier's director with all the conviction of a fairground candy floss. Her Canadian nationality and accent were presumably made to appeal to a transatlantic audience. That and she fails. Her original look in a tight pink jogging suit when she comes to work is risible. The part of "Siren Old Git that was right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if he were acting in his sleep, and the various plot designs designed to stimulate his son, played by Robert Carlyle, struggle to get an answer from him. <br /> <br /> Nigel Plans are determined to commit ritual hari kari for his mistakes as Met Office Director or for his act, or both, and only David Suchet presents some credit for his role as Deputy PM . There was enough in the story and cast and the effects have given a decent effort. Alas, that didn't happen.
