Oh my. Started with such great potential - a bunch of sweet sorority girls are almost naked, check out. Then go to a bar where the 80's cheese is turned up, check out. Go to a woodsy state park the next morning, check out. A bunch of girls and their professor, wavebikers, a general store guy and the living from The Living who act like the local drunk - make it a good body count, check (and talk about body counting, note the strong similarity on the DVD cover to The Alien Horror Girl - Body Count! aka Camping del Terrore). A whacky Indian in the forest makes a kind of ritual, hmmm, OK, I let it slip, check. And then, oh brother, all downhill from there. Terrible. Lochness monster head in the pond had me cracking though.
