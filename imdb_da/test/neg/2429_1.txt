It makes me bad to see a fantastic movie that turns into a bit of lame, repetitive and lazy series. It's filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a bad way. Who the dictators were, who decided to put such a big movie into this waste, should have done some research instead of filling it with one-liners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes from the first film OVER AND ABOVE AND ABOVE AND ABOUT AGAIN. Sure they get a little creative, but it's like seeing the same episode with a little twist. Almost much like listening to Creed, or Nickleback. Kuzco must stop failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone asks the monkey and the bay, Bucky emerges in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she's him without sounding like a bitch, Yzma rejects herself as "Principal Amzy" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit that this show has that moment. Another problem is that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks .... strange. In addition, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Theirs who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I give this show two thumbs down.
