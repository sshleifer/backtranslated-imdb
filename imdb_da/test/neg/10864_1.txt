This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I couldn't find anything to redeem this movie. The action, which is probably the best aspect of the movie, is fair at best. Michael Madsen foams it up in his standard character persona. Denis Hopper does not seem to know what he should be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks great. Her plays are pretty bad, but I doubt why shes there. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is really awful. It is simply nonsense. I don't know who signed this, but they really need professional help next time. <br /> <br /> This movie is the reason why IMDB rating system should include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.
