Don't make me wrong, I love a good movie and after seeing The Thin Red Line (and loved it), I was eager to track Terrence Malick's two previous films and just after seeing Heaven Days, my enthusiasm for see Badlands is almost gone. <br /> <br /> I noticed very rave about the beautiful photograph, but I saw this movie on a terribly old Vh tape that made it look pretty awful. All I can say is I hope the photography was great because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this movie. Not since the replacement killers have I fallen asleep during a movie. This movie felt so long (and it wasn't!), Editing was choppy and inconsistent, the story non-existent, the voice over was a disjointed ramble, the characters were weakly developed, and it was not all involved. I know Malick was unsure how to make the movie. He thus shot a lot of footage and then spent about two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together. This is very clear on the screen. Everything looks carved up every time a scene seems to have some momentum (or some character development), it would sharpen up to boring scenes of people who are boring. It was as if someone had tried to cut a story out of stock footage of people farming. The few good points are the music and the chase scene at the end, but these things are not how close enough to maintain the interest. I would normally let a bad movie go by without being too vocal, but when it is so much overrated, something has to be said. <br /> <br /> Maybe a farmer would like it ...?
