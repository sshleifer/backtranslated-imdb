Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Of course, this is not appropriate. It takes about half the film for the protagonists to realize what the big hilly stuff is in the middle of the city, spitting hot red things, and the other half spent redirecting the low flow through the city using fire trucks. It made me laugh. The action makes Arnie look like an RSC thespian. It's amazing that movies like this are being used. A more interesting version would be someone who is close to an active volcano and recorded it, and would probably cost about Â£ 20 to make. ($ 40) I can see any guy pitching the movie for a movie product "Well, there is this great VOLCANO and the eruption in a city .... pretty radical hi" If you can find it in the dollar bases, maybe worth buying after looking most other movies look good.
