I first saw this movie on a Saturday matinee when I was very young. I thought it was cool and often thought of it. Now I finally forward it to DVD. It was still very entertaining, but in a different way. It should rank as one of the most beautiful, most camping, 1950's sci-fi movies. It seemed filled with stock military recordings. The dialogue is silent and the effects are raw. There is a line of dialogue that made me sting. The line Jeff Morrow says while on the beach with the baby. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends. It's a classic.
