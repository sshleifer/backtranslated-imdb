Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I have ever seen and a great influence on my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is slick and awful and makes his memory no credit. The scripture is rooted and preserves too many lines from the book intact (the limbs here are incomprehensible). The actors' performances are uniformly ineffective, a huge cast wasted, and driver Sean Hughes delivers Milly's belligerent hostility into a complaining wild boar that goes beyond the point. The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce must accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows did it often, the novel "Puckoon" certainly did, but this movie, if anything, lowers just when you want the various elements to smash into one last climax. Milligan tells a shortened sound recording of "Puckoon" in 1980, with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now it's fun. Ten minutes of it is more fun than this whole movie. I think the LP was transferred to CD, but I don't know if it's still in print. <br /> <br /> There is a movie of "Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It's also a good-natured mess, but it's more fun than this. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are devoted to courtesy and wishful thinking. This movie fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.
