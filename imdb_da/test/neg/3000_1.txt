This is the most boring, pretentious and stupid movie I've seen for a long time. I saw it at the Beverly Hills Academy and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and sought refuge there. Everyone was solemnly shaken upside down and looked as if they had been in funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious blimp good reviews. What's with them? Are they just afraid they will not be considered "hip"? Were they circumcised? This movie is staggeringly bad. Do not take a date as you expect to have an in-depth chat at the Cheesecake factory afterwards. If you want to see this movie was your idea, she will browbeat you and keep it over you for the rest of your life.
