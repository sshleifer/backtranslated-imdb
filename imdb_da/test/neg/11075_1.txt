I love movies ... and rarely do I see a movie I hate ... but it was the worst movie I have ever seen or at least close to it. Any movie ending with a rape scene is horrible. Hands down ... I can't believe I wasted 2 hours in my life and watched this movie. I'm really angry, I want my money back and my time back. TERRIBLE! Don't go to see it, cinematography is terrible, the plot is terrible, the end is terrible. I didn't know what was going on in half of the movie because I couldn't see it (and I watched a very nice and big TV) Rent, the hills have eyes or waxing ... any of them are better, If you want something scary.
