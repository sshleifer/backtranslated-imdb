Chupacabra according to this mockumentary is a mysterious <br /> <br /> creature that has killed and eaten Spanish Spanish in Latin <br /> <br /> America and Mexico for years. One has crossed the border <br /> <br /> southern Texas, and a cute, pristine cryptozoologist (no, I didn't <br /> <br /> do the word) go to an isolated ranch to find one. Her uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature and there are some grainy video footage of the <br /> <br /> sample. She takes a badass black guy with a gun and two cameramen (for easy editing coverage) and they go ahuntin 'to <br /> <br /> chupacabras. Ten minutes in the movie they find it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the team of documentaries been attacked by the bloodthirsty monster and the stylish dialogue. At one <br /> <br /> point, the team runs into a couple of hottie witches that lead them <br /> <br /> to the chupacabras nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew about how <br / > <br /> cheap Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informants. Whole <br /> <br /> decades of mythical animal reports could be cleared up with a blank check. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give a goat patot, a chupacabra is trapped, killed, and <br /> <br /> autopsy. The only point in the autopsy scene is to highlight <br /> <br /> the makeup department's efforts in such a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot on video, like "BWP", yet the camera men <br /> <br /> never reload their tapes or recharge their camera <br /> <br /> batteries. The leading actress here is horrible. The beauty of the <br /> <br /> average "BWP" was its use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> Here are all the lines written and delivered as a bad <br /> <br /> Christmas gift. <br /> <br /> The movie is also tame with racism. The only African American <br /> <br /> here is a high-mass gun nut. At a time when the crew breaks <br /> <br /> into an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who <br/> <br /> ask them comically whether they are from INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a guy in a rubber boot and no more. For <br /> <br /> such a paralyzing and awkward animal, he is able to sneak at <br /> <br /> cast pretty quietly, whether they are idiotically locked themselves <br /> <br /> in a huge cage as bait or may not seem to get their <br /> <br /> only vehicle started. <br /> <br /> Gore is cruel, but when surrounded by this kind of <br /> <br /> stupidity, it loses all its effectiveness. I don't know if this was <br /> <br /> shot before or after "BWP" but I can honestly say this is the worst <br /> <br /> movie ever made in southern Texas about a mythical animal. Bed <br /> <br /> There are no successors, I want to start a letter writing campaign for <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> This is characterized (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, strong <br /> <br /> doing and profanity. <br /> <br />
