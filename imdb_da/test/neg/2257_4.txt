A very un-Tom and Jerry card. Jerry tells this story about Tom, the cat who falls in love and loses her to his rival, Butch. Tom's the best friends with Jerry here who indulged me a little. The comic book is also presented in Cinemascope. Overall, I found this Tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressing. They should just put "Puss get boot" on DVD instead, and I would have been happy. This experimental animated card is available on disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set. It's the last thing on the set, and I hope Warner Brothers will release another Volume soon. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
