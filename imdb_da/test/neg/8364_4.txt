Last night I saw an early preview screen of Prozac Nation. Because I love everything Christina Ricci does, I was very excited at first, but when the movie continued I was wondering where it was going. Based on a true story, it's simply about Christina Ricci's character and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family that you can probably tell from the title. In my opinion, this movie was moving too fast and it was too dramatic. I would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie moved very quickly through its life, and it made no room for connecting with Christina Ricci's character. Christina Ricc's performance was fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the film, and I think this movie will be all because of her and Christina Ricci. I would rate this 4 out of 10 and I would suggest renting this or reading the books of Elizabeth Wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out.
