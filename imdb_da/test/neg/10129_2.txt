I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes aren't even close to what we usually say funny. It's like Alex says something that isn't fun or interesting, and then there's suddenly a laughing background. My friend and I just looked at each other with shiny looks as if we were asking each other, "What's so funny ?!". Seriously, every time we saw that show, you wouldn't hear anyone laughing or coughing. Just a shiny look. So we stop seeing it. I'm a personal fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But showing us such a disappointment. This show can be one of the worst comedy situations ever ...
