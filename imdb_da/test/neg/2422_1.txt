This movie is probably the worst movie I've seen for a very long time. The action is so wood a door could have done a better job. The reason is ridiculous and low, and the "rugby" shown is far from reality. I still don't get "hooked" as portrayed in this bad excuse for entertainment. I'm not a kiwi, but I know that Haka can only be done by any of Maori origin and not by an American white boy. I suppose this was made for the American audience so pristine and "Disney end" is excusable, but there was hardly any attempt to point out the player's basic rules except for the prison side, where the protagonist suddenly takes charge of an American football game and gets everyone to to play rugby instead. The only good thing about this movie was the final credit. Using ninety minutes to insert toothpicks into your eyes would be less painful.
