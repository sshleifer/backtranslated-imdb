Good God! This movie should have a new classification on its cover "look only if you absolutely have nothing else to do!". I am disappointed. I was looking forward to a good horror movie this weekend ... in need of an adrenaline rush, and the amazing tincture of sensation goes down the back. But this movie didn't. A fairly good story, but rather horrible plays, dialogue and movies. It was uneven and sometimes quite stupid. We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking loudly (for themselves) and telling what they were feeling and what was going to happen, shading equipment in some shots, stupid clich√©s like "I just need to keep myself "in the very wrong places and situations. Thank you for allowing me to offload and regret if I had offended anyone, but it was a waste of time and money.
