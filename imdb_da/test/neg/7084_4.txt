This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a moment that it's getting almost every aspect of the Russian revolution wrong - we only have one hour here to tell our story. In fact, after the First World War, the tsar was abdicated, and a preliminary government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story. <br /> <br /> Here, the revolution has been "rumored" in Russian newspapers in what still seems to be a functioning country until the violence suddenly bursts and ends the life of noble Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flies his home with his former maid Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they begin to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, Baron made a regular habit of making a game for the girl, not out of any genuine passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution does not change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is, of course, a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to watch him play with her. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries' takeover of the Baron's home, and she has no known life other than waiting for Nikki's hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki urgently needs life as a troublesome job, and that is when he meets his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who plans to bring them to Paris, where the Tsarists have gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her. <br /> <br /> This movie perfectly wastes the great actors of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job of what little she is allowed to do, but it's not much. Lilyan Tashman is a standout here, although she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given support roles as she is here, but her earthly voice and glamorous appearance make her the center of attention in every scene where she looks. Guy Kibbee even appears in a humorous piece as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royal who has been exhausted heavily from their homeland.
