This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - it is obviously the lame, fake-looking bird doll that floats around the cheap sets without ever flapping the wings (as if it were on a leash perhaps?), Attacking model trains and toy cars. "Science" is asinine - a masonic atom gun ?? And what about the huge amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's were Slimeball's decade! Well, this bird doll apparently comes from "something god-forsaken anti-matter universe" and it is here to build a nest and lay eggs in New York. Seriously. Being able to kill the puppet is almost a shame. I give it 1 court out of 4 - it's stupid and stupid, but moore fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
