This has to be the most horrible piece of film shit I've ever seen. That makes Mel Brooks film Oscar-worthy in comparison. Jim VanBebber must be made public to try to transfer it as any entertainment. While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "The Living Days Night", the production value is not relevant. It is VanBebber's ability to throw and present a plausible story line. The castings are regrettable. For Charlie's role, he must have chosen the first actor he saw with beard and long hair. Never mind that this actor's hair came halfway down on his back (Manson never walked much past his shoulders) spoke this actor in a terribly monotonous without as much as a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies borrowed for their portrayals of Manson . The actor chosen to play "Tex" Watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most distant interest in the Manson case knows. He looks like a Minnesota farmer at "Little House on the Prairie". The actress who plays Susan Atkins has a roots wider than Oprah's. While those who are familiar with family members know that "Clem" was considered somewhat retarded, the actor who portrayed him did so in such a campy, Chaplinesque way as seeing an old Vaudevile action. Instead of Sharon Tate resembling a beautiful, pregnant woman, the actor looked like a flabby, alcoholic trailer. VanBebber speeds up the film in some places for artistic effect, but this technique has not proved to be extremely useful since "The Munsters". The final credits list all known family members, but we are never introduced to most of them, and those we are introduced to are not sure of who they are. Facts are also destroyed in this movie. . "Lotsapoppa" did not actually die, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger did not have her neck gap, Where was Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis under Himnan Murder? Patricia Krenwinkel never sported a "Dorothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most enchanting aspect of this movie is what the modern "freaks" had to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? Viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Holy mackerel I could go on, but space prevents it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this waste because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while repeatedly saying "What f ---?"
