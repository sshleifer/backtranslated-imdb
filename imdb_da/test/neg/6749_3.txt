This movie was actually shot and made in 1987, but it didn't hit theaters until 1990. When I saw this movie I could see the good intentions it had, but I'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work. History takes place in California in the 1890s, and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are told to leave their country so a railway can get through. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who has offered money to the country, but has been knocked down. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero, and he is proud to leave and ask the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land. Berrigan grows impatiently and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to flee. These bullies are led by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and he doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him trouble. Andrews and his men kill Collogero one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) promises to seek revenge and get the land back for everyone. Marco runs over the bridge that the railroad would need, and they also destroy a tunnel, and this puts the project back for several months, and Berrigan is now starting to get the heat from other investors. This movie was directed by Peter Masterson and besides "The Trip To Bountiful" he has at best a spotty career in the direction. He is a fine actor, but here he seems to be in his head. This was a movie that desperately needed more attention to detail, and it was easy to see that it didn't. Roberts Hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but it is believed to be 1890! The filmmaker is Toyomichi Kurita, who ended up being a good cameraman, but it was only his fourth movie, and he certainly hadn't learned everything at the time. It's not a sharp looking movie at all, and I noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be sharp of something, and the scenes just didn't have the sharpness that would have helped the overall look. The script is just a story of revenge, and no surprises occur during the film. We know that Giannini will get it and it just seemed a matter of time. The molding is top notch and they do their best, but the whole film comes across as uninspired. This was promoted as Julia Roberts movie debut, but I'm not sure it is correct. She could have appeared in a movie called "Firehouse" before this.
