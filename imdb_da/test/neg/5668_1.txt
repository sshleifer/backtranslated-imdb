First of all, I just want to say that this show could have done well, far better than it does now. What brought it down was definitely the actor. Miranda Cosgrove, who acts as the main character Carly, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was at Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big disappointment. Not only can Miranda not act convincingly enough, but she is incredibly stiff when she moves. She looks as though she is not sure how the "carly" sign would move or stand. In the very first episode at the end, when she throws the hat up, her arm never leaves her side from her elbow. Even when she danced, she looked like a stick in the breeze. And the song? The theme song was great, just because Drake had been in it, the music was pretty good, and Miranda's voice sounded fake. I have to admit that the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hi, it's Nick. They are almost known for stupid lines and signs. But wow, iCarly is the worst of them all.
