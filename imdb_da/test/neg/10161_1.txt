Most of Wayne's B westerns are fun in a naive way, but this really stinks. The editing is horrible, and the direction and pacing are completely blunt. Most of the molded around are waiting for the stupid guy to write down his thoughts on a sheet of paper and I was bored. Sorry, Duke, but it gets a 1.
