No budget direct to video story of aliens in Arizona involving the military and escaped prisoners. <br /> <br /> Not bad as such, but rather the cast and crew kind of going through steps instead of trying to sell it. It's as if they knew they were in a class Z movie and want you to know they know. So again, they just can't get it together. <br /> <br /> A misfire of a class z movie that could have been something if someone was worried - and had the skill. Why make budget filmmakers insist on not trying to do something good instead of just making a product. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 because nothing comes together
