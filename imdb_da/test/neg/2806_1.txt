If you've been to eastern Europe (or even in their armed forces), you might find this movie interesting. I don't know why it calls this a comedy (surely there are some fun moments), but it's not a good movie if one of the orderly officers speaks for 15 minutes about the results of socialism on a Christmas dinner and officers generally act as funny oafs, the soldiers run off the base to meet their girls at night, and surprise surprise, one of the girls is the commander's daughter. The East German army was known for its violent and humiliating service by its accused men, and the comedy was largely unoccupied with the facilities or with the equipment to make a good movie from the East German army and their time now passed. Despite this, some of the actors and actors tried to work well, but it only came out in the roles they are known for from East German television and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheaply made.
