Horrible, horrible, horrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the movie pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force me to watch it at the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: Read the book, it's much better and you don't have to deal with all those stupid pictures and ridiculous dreams that Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I think I've never seen such a bad movie.
