Any film school student could make a movie 1000 times better than a piece of waste. As one who had read the book, I even expected an even mention of the book would make this a fair movie. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodwards's story and make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Now, the director went beyond Woodward's story. He added a hip Spanish angel named Velasquez who was not in the book. He had Bob Woodward interviewed the dead Belushi in an exchange in the morning house. The film had all the insight that someone stoned on PCP, staring at his navel. <br /> <br /> If this is a spoiler for you, thank you for it because it's definitely the worst movie ever made.
