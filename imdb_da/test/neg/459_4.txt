Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire over the sides of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name for a short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the Caribbean ports to trading houses in London ..... hmm that the opening to the movie sounds like we're in for a hell With a rogue, looting, ripping a movie, right? Well that's not it. Tho it is not totally without value as a curio piece. From the 20th century Fox is Anne Of The Indies adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson provides Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the title title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence}, and the support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Originally, being based on true life meant pirate Anne Bonny, the movie eventually shows a story of a woman seeking identity, and finds herself in the predominantly male-led world of piracy and offshore shenanigans. Filled with clich√©s and above known set pieces, the film also suffers from a roll that is largely misfires. Peters gives it a really good trip, and Paget shines the screen with exuberant beauty. While Robertson Justice, although underutilized, actually looks that part out and does not overdo as the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the movie to find intelligence and hidden meanings, simply because it is the Tourneur in the steering wheel. But there is no depth here, it is only a job for Tourneur, a professional who is provided, but it is sparsely plotted and actually lacks the push of the bucks in the action money. <br /> <br /> Disposable at best. 4.10
