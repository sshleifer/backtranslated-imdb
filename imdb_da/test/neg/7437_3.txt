This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I was expecting more laughs. Considering the story and the main actor (Bill Murray), it should have been much more fun than it turned out. Only part of this made me laugh, for example, when Murray lost control of his semi and was about to go down the road at a strange angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) <br /> <br /> The support aids were anything but nice people. Just look at a sample of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as "Tip Tucker" was just quite annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Other to these people, the movie had some charming moments, but generally it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
