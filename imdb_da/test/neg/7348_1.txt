I always hated this retarded show. I liked the notion of Cartoon Network as "Dexter's laboratory" or "Megas XLR. But I have never liked this piece of turd. Basically because it has stupid characters (the good or the bad guys all seem to be mentally retarded) they have stupid voices (especially bubbles. She must be the "sweet" character of the show, but she is incredibly annoying) The lines of history are very, very stupid. Some episodes could have been interesting, but almost always the show becomes childish and corny. some nice character, the music was terrible and the animation is the worst I have seen. Evena five year old boy could draw better! I can't see why the whole world seems to love this piece of waste. "The Powerpuff Girls" seems to be a of the worst cartoons ever made, fortunately, "Foster Home for the imaginary friends" from the same creator was far better.
