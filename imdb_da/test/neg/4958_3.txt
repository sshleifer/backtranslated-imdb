I have seen many horrors, splatter, monster movies in my life. And of course also many monster films from the 50s and 60s. When I first stumbled upon this, I thought it was from the 60s until I recognized it from 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, Jack Brooks's character is interesting and it's all about a splatter movie altogether. but .... I expected a splatter movie and not a drama story of an aggressive plum. The movie runs 80 Mminutes and I think the first kill is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, the reason why monsters come from is at least 3 minutes ... we have another 20 minute boring dialogue and finally one, in my opinion, not the well-managed splatter sequence. Although we have Robert Englund starring here, I only recommend this to real hardcore horror fans.
