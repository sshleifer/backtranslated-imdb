That was what I felt like shouting and stomping out of the theater, but I kept myself. Yes the play was amazing, no it wasn't the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue wouldn't end (or be interesting)! And despite all the gabbing, you never really get to know or worry about any of the characters. Certainly the most boring movie I've seen since Sphere, but I expected it to be boring. I had to sit through it, but please save yourself
