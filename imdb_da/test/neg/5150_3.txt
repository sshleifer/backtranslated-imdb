This movie started cringe-worthy - but it was the intention of an indulgent mother, a witch of a rival, and a hesitant queen of beauty came in second place. There were some bleak overacting and a few incredible plot points (She comes in second in each competition? ALL of them?) Unfortunately, the movie is terribly suffering from it having to be a television movie. Instead of ending at the end of the movie, an entertaining twist where the killer (semi-plausible) is revealed, the movie continues for another twenty minutes to just ensure that justice is complete. Of course, when the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift - her character is being completely rewritten because the authors do not have to keep her identity secret any more. The cheese completely drops what else could have been a passable fun movie.
