Here's another low quality movie from the "Disney" company. There is no more Disney spirit. The story is boring. All feelings are false. It is not sweet or moving. Disney company was at one time a kind of magic company that gave dreams to children. It is now about making money. Shame on the people who take advantage of Disney's name for their personal benefit. It's an empire's fall. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
