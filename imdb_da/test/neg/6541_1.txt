Most movies are crappy with high production values, this one is crappy without high production values. Which puts it apart from the large pool of horrible movies. As bad as this movie, I had to give due respect to Kathryn Aselton, who I think, if it is the right manuscript, would probably be quite a good performance. She plays Emily's girlfriend of perennial doofus Josh, who often refers to her as "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But here it is, Emily is a semi-credible character which means that Rhett will soon be added to the casting to counteract this almost credible character with a guy even more sensible than Josh. When we first meet Rhett, we learn that he is "deep" because he is the videotape a lizard that is proven that he sees the world "unique"! Rhett then shows the band to Emily, and in one of Emily's few incredible moments, she seems impressed by this company's band, WOW, I think she reacts again without the irony of sarcasm herself mildly implied. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene you get a warning that the camera's work is getting crazy, we open up a shaky close-up of Josh as he tries to win over the viewers by performing GOOFY! Oh, how worried is this main player that he will act GOOFY! haha. This movie could almost be a case study of how BAD movies can be (and for that matter just how FAR bad movies can get into the festival circuit, I mean, in comparison to most circuit forces, that this movie probably seemed pretty amazing). <br /> <br /> I think SXSW gave this movie a little less expensive (oh south-southwest why you're calling them, it's just cruel). But here's where I handle this movie a compliment, it's the best of the mumblecore movement. Remember that all other mumblecore movies sucked out of faith and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensible bad plays, but still good to be the best of anything. I haven't seen the baghead yet, but it looks like maybe they made a couple of advances ahead, at least it turned out to be tolerable where as even the Puffy Chair preview couldn't hide the fact that it would be sucked. I've got a topic here, yet, Rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor, just as Josh is probably not an actor, but rather the director (or brother of the instructor, there are some mixed messages there). I think Rhett was somebody buddy and they said hello why don't you play the guy named Rhett in the movie, the fact that Rhett is the actor's name and character probably means that the actor and character are the same unless I wrong, which I am not. <br /> <br /> If Rhett shaved raccoon out of his face, you'd say he was attractive. So yet, Rhett, Emily and Josh run together to bring the Puffy Chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things happen along the way, more bad acting, bad entertainment actors, crappy camera work, an attempt at meaning. This movie would not have been bad if it hadn't been so shameless to pursue deep self-esteem. The whole thing is amateurish if you can watch this movie without paying for it, as if it is on TV or for rent at the library, so consider looking at it, just to see if you like this super cheap movie production style . I like what the duplex does it all, make a movie with no concept, but I wish they would make a movie that someone would like to see.
