A blackface man lands in a spaceship and meets a girl living in a kind of cabin with a monkey. He chops her with a phone and she teaches him how to go to Charleston. Then they fly into the spaceship and leave the monkey. Cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure of a long shot. You can't tell that this is Renoir at work, despite his distinctive humanism. Good use of slow-motion, however. Can be found on the NY Film Annex's series of experimental video videos, No. 18, I think.
