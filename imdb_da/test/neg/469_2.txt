How to take Charles Darwin's amazing intellectual journey and make it a chicken. His pivotal and usual ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two short scenes, allegedly "killing God"; pure demagogy to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie spans for that purpose: It consists solely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overflow music where one can see crying. Anyone who actually reads "Origin of Species" would be vividly aware that there was no violation of God in any of Darwin's work; on the contrary, there was increased awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin could be educational, thought-provoking and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but it would contradict this flap's soap opera intentions. This is a glimpse designed to make people cry in confidential sympathy and then feel transformed even though it is not possible to understand why; It quickly makes use of Darwin's big name only as a marketing move, as one would drop a famous name for a party to create an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: the production values, apart from the writing, were of course high. See it if you want to cry for loss of intelligence in American literature.
