I can very well remember the bad press that this movie got because of the producer's court order against Clayton Moore using the name "Lone Ranger" or donating his black mask for personal appearances. Apart from any consideration of the quality of the film, this was the absolute height of myopic arrogance and stupidity among the producers and their lawyers. And I suppose the lesson was well-learned after this film was thought, which was largely perceived as a kind of karma for the jerks responsible for the court against Moore. In recent times, it has become the custom when you revive a legendary movie or television project, inviting the original star or stars to cameo appearances, and rightly so. Show some respect, you idiots! And even though they come up in their noses at the prospect, which has happened, the offer was certainly made. It is positive that film producers, study managers and entertainment lawyers are not too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.
