A half mysterious thriller and half of the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind, the "Guardian of the Frontier" is an exciting journey that soon leaves behind. Strong imagery and a convincing premise are soon overcome by incoherent plotting, hackneyed dialogue, amateurish action and the most outlandish and over-the-top phallic images in recent memory (here's a fish absolutely not just a fish!). Obviously, this is the first Slovenian feature film to be directed by a woman - Mrs Weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as foolish and unfounded explicitly as any man.
