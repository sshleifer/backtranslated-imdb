This is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class and teacher in bed. <br /> <br /> Completely boring long silent (yes silent) strings of independent video clips. <Br /> <br /> Instead of this movie watching the painting dry or the grass growing - it will be more interesting unless you enjoy watching Arabs be malicious for everyone around them. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (the director) should be ashamed of this lame waste of film. It deserves one for movie quality, one zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and one negative number for the script (or lack thereof).
