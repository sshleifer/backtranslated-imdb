I thought "puppets making crank phone calls" were pretty low, but I don't think Carlos Mencia's show even qualifies as a comedy. His main goal is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as many times as possible. I have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the apprehension of something on IMDb before, but I really hope this show will never be renewed or resumed. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. It's obvious right down to the rip of the Chapelle intro (blues guys vs mariachi band). Mencia has absolutely no * attitude, and does not dive into the popular views of Latin American culture enough to come up with a creative poke on it every time. Instead, he sticks to a small number of hardly shocking nicknames for his fellow men and makes "jokes" about immigration. Every once in a while, he will take advantage of the little darkness of his skin to make it fun for another, as between Eastern cultures. These jokes consist mainly of repeating any joke or stereotype against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old subjects (such as 9/11), in a dimmed stand-up style while laughing at himself to cover the audience quiet. I think he is too scared to really offend anyone so it just makes the viewer feel awkward. He also beats jokes to death. If you've ever seen "Why f *** is this news?" You know what I'm talking about. It's fun first, but he just falls over and over and becomes Captain Obvious at some point. <br /> <br /> It is a trainwreck that is purely painful to see.
