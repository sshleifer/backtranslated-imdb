There is no doubt that this movie is silly and eerie joke, but tell the truth, it's pretty entertaining (if you're the first time viewer and don't try to analyze anything). All over the film has very good ideas, but poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers wakes up to find out they can't remember what's happening to them the day before. Only to find out later that they are followed by the angry twin girl friends, foreigners, transsexual strippers, foreigners geeks and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Isn't it like Bourne Identity? Yes, yes, I know - how can I compare the two films, but what the hell? They both have no memories; people were after them and so on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer who likes silly movies. <br /> <br /> Reason for seeing: · Lots of young talented actors · Very stupid (after all, you know it a stupid movie, why not make it extreme). Reason Not for: · If you want to analyze, forget it. · Talented young actors get bad. · Good plod gets really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Grade: E +) <br /> <br /> ------------ ----- ------ ---------- ---------- ------ --- --------- ---- < br /> <br /> 'Dude Where's My Car' awaits what do you expect from Ashton Kutchers movie. I think almost everybody got the same answer for this guy - "A really stupid movie". Apart from 'That 70s' Shows, this guy has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation). 'Dude Where's My Car' is one of his trademarks - 'stupidity'. Somehow, his movie is even worse than Adam Sandler's movie (can you imagine). The movie is really non-sense, no story line, and nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W. Scoot should not have wasted their talent on this waste. They even came with 'Seriously, Dude Where's My Car'. This shows how film companies die from making money over quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Borrow it from your friends or just forget it
