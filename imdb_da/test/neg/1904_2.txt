If you need a clue as to whether the Playmaker is decent or not, look to the star Colin Firth, referring to it in an interview as "absolute nonsense - I sincerely hope nobody ever sees it." The script and the plot are ridiculous, the female lead is convincing. All that is worth is Colin Firth, and he seems a little embarrassed everywhere. <br /> <br /> Only for diehard Firth fans - The shower alone is worth the $ 3.99 you might need if you find it in a video cutout bin I did. <br /> <br /> I love Mr. Firth that his days of taking projects like this are over!
