This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC), among the so-called "Poverty Row" film studios in the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how little money was spent doing it. <br /> <br /> The music is forgotten. Cast member Gerra Young exhibits an opera quality voice but is a kind of discount Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database does not show any other movie performance for her, so let's hope she was able to move on to some sort of position in the Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The opening broadcasts for the print broadcast sent by Turner Classic Film indicate that this film has been preserved by the National Film Museum. This promptly asks the question? Why? <br /> <br /> Are their resources so abundant that they can afford to keep junk? Some low-budget or B-musicals from that era have redeeming features that make them worthwhile. This movie has no one. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, skip this movie. It really drops an hour of your time.
