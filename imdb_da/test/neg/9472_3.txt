An aging Roger Moore is back again as Bond, this time trying to figure out why Agent 009 was killed and why he had fake a Faberge egg with him and where it came from. He ends up in New Delhi India and then in East Germany after finding out if a Russian general is trying to detonate a nuclear bomb in a circus and hopes that NATO will push for complete disarmament so he can take control of Western Europe, so the rest of world. <br /> <br /> Despite the way it sounds, it's really more of a romance I think between Bond and Octopussy than an action movie, and long-lasting, but still a bit of fun. But there are far too many attempts at humor in this one; at times it seems like it was supposed to be a comedy. Also, Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in this, so there wouldn't have been so much of an age difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Useless trivia: The little plane that Bond uses in the pre-circle sequence is now up in a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in the Clearwater / Largo area of ​​Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of ****
