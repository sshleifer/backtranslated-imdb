One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Absolutely ridiculous. The story is bad. The animations are completely childish and displaced. The hologram's physics is hilarious from how much they are completely wrong. OMG, I would even think this movie has the Disney label on it. Yuck. The actresses are pretty beautiful, but there are so many great movies with amazing actresses that are far more valuable to watch than this one. Finally note, bad movie. Don't see it. If you're looking for movies to watch with your kids, consider other alternatives like Ratattuile, Monster Inc or an enchanted story (in theaters). Seriously.
