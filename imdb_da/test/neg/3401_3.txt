How is this a documentary? Much more like a ghost tour you can take in any southern city. Quotes were generously dropped without the first effort to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified quota. <br /> <br /> Documents were featured without being produced in any form. Flat-out fraudulent shots depicting film films were spliced ​​away from historical film rolls without separation from reality and self-promotion. Film rolls that were completely unrealistic and unlikely for the time that was present had fallen as if trying to monkey Blair Witch hoping to drum a ghost house on what would otherwise be dead property. <br /> <br /> Is it in no way a great respect for the actual victims of TB, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? The line between actual recordings and manufactured self-service is so thin; The drops of doubt played so insignificantly the scientific boundaries so overtly ignored ... how could this possibly be listed in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> It's a vacation prom and it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Hell, I want to visit the joint if I could find it on Google Earth. Not scary said a previous poster. Not too seriously either, says I. Fascinating story. Flimsy film production.
