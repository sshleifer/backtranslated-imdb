The only thing of interest to this movie is its subject. Looking at the Manson "family" from the point of view of family members is a good idea. However, trying to sense the incomprehensible is something that can really only be achieved in a masterpiece - and it is not. Probably because there was so much information to push into a manuscript, this film was made in a faux documentary style with reconstructions thrown in. The problem is that writing and steering make it impossible to establish the things that make a movie visible as character, history, theme and so on. <br /> <It is worse there is an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in, following a small band of the latter Mansonites as they go for a reporter working on a story of the anniversary of the killings. It is stupid and pointless, and a complete waste of time. All in all, this movie is a great waste of opportunity. One ray of sunshine is the play by Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in fact did most of the actual killing. While the female characters come out as giggly airheads in the 60's flashbacks, Pitman manages to convey a true feeling. In short, don't bother with this movie.
