Some people say this show was good in the early years! I disagree with all of them. The show is simply stupid and pathetic. My mother hates it, I hate it, my father hates it, I don't know about my sister, but good. Here are some reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Characteristics: Babies being used as adult characters are stupid. The babies are just awful and annoying. The adults and the adults are stupid and unpleasant. The worst thing is that Angelica Pickles (she really does it for your eardrum when you had a long, hard and miserable day in the office) and also Kimi Finster, later shown; she is too optimistic and a pain in her butt. She can't decide where she is French or Japanese: it doesn't matter; You are an American citizen and that is it! Oh, what am I talking about, all the characters from this show suck! <br /> <br /> 2. The Stories: The stories are unoriginal and stupid. It does that as the babies go on a great adventure, yes to the backyard shed. In an episode, Tommy Pickles Leader broke into a television control room and almost destroyed it. Don't give children any idea to smash up to normal T.V Station's control room (they pay a terrible amount of money for those in real life). I can imagine what broadcasters should feel like moving this episode, they will probably start staring at their machines all day, afraid a baby will slow down. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3. Overrated !: The show has been running for years now and people are still making stories and new series and spin-offs for this. Get off! The Simpsons have gone almost the same time as this, but they are much better and more fun than babies. The show is simply over rated! People where is your reason! <br /> <br /> Whatever, I was surprised by the T.V Stations around the world would like to close this series right now. The show is completely undesirable and should never have been produced. The two movies for this cartoon just sucked the same thing! 2.10
