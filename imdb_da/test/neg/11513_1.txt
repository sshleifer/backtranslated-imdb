With actors like Depardieu and Richard, making a boring movie really is a tough task. But Weber is a master of putting a slow pace and making seemingly fun scenes without any knowledge and depth. This movie is high on the story, but low in character. You never learn any of the characters except superficial slapsticks. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described by hit and miss. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone sliding on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor to this party. It's a shame how bad he uses good talent. Many good French comedians have been wasted by mediocre directors.
