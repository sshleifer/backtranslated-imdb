Occasionally fun but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hegyes from Welcome back Carter (aka Epstein) as the former celebrity. There is a knee joint, the intestinal busting scene with the French lady having a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed but have only minor roles. You never learn the signs, and it is difficult to care for what happens to them. Not recommended.
