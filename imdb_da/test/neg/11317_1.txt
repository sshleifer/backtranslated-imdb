I saw it with my children, they love it, but I was not run over by a reindeer in the song, but what dunk in this crazy movie she was hit by the sled is what the fool why why, then my kids heard they lowered what they thought was good, but we saw that they were like this "father, why did grandma" what my kids say grandmother, just as my kids said this "dad, why was grandma hit of a sleigh "I told them the movie was crappy they agreed, it was sad, why would anyone mention there dog" Doofas "it's just stupid and when everyone dressed in black as so so then I mean Daphne looked like a dang emo goth girl every one looked like goths and in the song they found grandma on the ground i think she died in the song but in this weird crazy movie she was gone i think they should take this show OK, everyone would love this, i give this a 1 out of 10
