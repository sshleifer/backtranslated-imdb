"Wagons East" was a big disappointment to me. But the shameful thing about this movie is that it turned out to be John Candy's last movie role (he died just before the shot ended on this). There are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof and for a comedy that doesn't cut it. If you want to see a monstrous spoof of Western movies, the answer is obvious. See Mel Brooks' classic "Blazing Saddles". Or if you want to see Candy in much better material, see "Summer Rental", "Spaceballs" or "Uncle Buck" (just to name a few). These three films (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, "Wagons East" does not mean. What a shame! <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
