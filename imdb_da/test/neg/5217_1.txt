Boring, misleading plot, some of the worst directions I've ever encountered, idle plays and horribly clich√©. The film ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream. What about it? Even JR from Dallas couldn't survive the lame twist. <br /> <br /> You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship that develops between a protagonist and a young girl, which apparently is supposed to be dangerous, but which comes out as pervert. You have freshman community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of Kimberly Hole. This is like the children's children encountering the passion of Christ, which is imposed on an endless cycle of government education video - at the end of it, if you do not consider ending it, you have no brain. <br /> <br /> Don't bother.
