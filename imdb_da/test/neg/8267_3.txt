I found this a very disappointing experience! But I added a better option for similar style at the foot of this post. <br /> <br /> This "Felicia's Journey" is exciting. It has drama. But it's full of stereotypes! <br /> <br /> So it only serves judicial temperament without worrying for fairer justice and justice and truth, in addition to black white reviews that fit 30-second ads of "NEWS" that dot our multimedia experiences every day, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such pictures! <br /> <br /> It's so magnified, it reminds me of the adventure "Little Red Ridinghood"! Consider the innocent young girl without crossing borders who have questioned a guard, but freed without evidence to venture to look for her 'Romeo', who did not give her an address, VERSUS the pathetically inappropriate lack of substance in it raspy voice of 'helping hand' turns to her with her unlikely story made by the team! <br /> <br /> It seems to be the directors and management that no one has faith or pray to God, even in their desperation times! <br /> <br /> So in these early settings orchestrates & tells a lot of what's coming! A nightmare trip that distorts the essence of the substance without any eventual resolution without truth or integrity or credibility! ... So a twist and that's all. What a disappointment! If you want to see a very superior movie exploring similar themes with much more credibility, with much more powerful insights, see the 1983 Paul Cox / Norman Kaye "Man of Flowers" movie !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here you will NOT be disappointed!
