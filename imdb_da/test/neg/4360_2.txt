It doesn't say much. This Killjoy movie has better movies and is more professional than the last. It does not mean that it is more professional sounding. The horrible last movie was about gangsters killing a child and then being haunted by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy in the last was a bad actor but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I've ever seen in any movie, and I've seen many movies. The last movie came the clown for about 15 minutes, this one is shorter, and the clown doesn't even come in for 40 minutes, and it's only 65 minutes long !!! I give it a 2 because the appearance of some characters is OK.
