I chose this DVD up to 3.99 on roger's video to get enough points to get a better movie for free. I never planned to see this, but it started popping on my curiosity, and I finally decided to pop into the DVD player. The effects in this movie are terrible and cheap. Some of the dialogue in this movie sounds like it was written by a very happy 12-year-old boy. The action is really cheesy in some parts, and the "action" scenes are quite ridiculous. You will burst out laughing at some parts, which was positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained. The reason is that some girls have a curse on her that causes her to vomit snakes, so some shaman has to get her to Los Angeles and there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people who are insignificant to the plot, not that there really is a plot at all. Don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover, there are no 100 passengers and 3000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 sleepers. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as the movie, a blooper coil that is only a shot over and over by an actor trying to say trains, and the deleted scenes are really meaningless if they were good enough to stay in this movie, they must be pretty bad. There is also a really bad presentation of featurette, which doesn't show much at all, except that those involved in this movie were kind of idiots. I can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh with friends. I give it 2 kitty cats out of 5.
