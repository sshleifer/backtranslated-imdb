This is beyond silly. <br /> <br /> Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket for the summer and find situations that are totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore co-stars in this. When the movie was in 1986, Ashton Kutcher was just a treasure in the forest at that time? Moore's grandfather is dead and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son bringing a new meaning to the phrase mean. <br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldthwait, with the unpleasant voice in the movie, as well as two brothers who do stupid and stupid looks more and more intelligent. <br /> <br /> Scripture is absolutely ridiculous. Highlights in stupidity are where someone says to the other: "Have you ever noticed that when people die, they go alphabetically in the papers?" <br /> <br /> I rest on my case.
