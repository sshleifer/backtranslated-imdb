I felt that the film Shame, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of those actions; but I feel it was not complete or attentive to keeping. He never came completely into the plot or deep into the character's feelings or causes behind their actions. The only thing I found little attention in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Many times during the film, only the two main characters were sitting around or doing their daily work and did not even have a conversation. I understand that this was showing the reality of these people, but I feel there are other ways to show reality and make it entertaining. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this movie in a more clever way.
