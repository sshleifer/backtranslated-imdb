Dee Snider is the villain of this movie, and his bad acting and overactive kind of it destroyed me. The whole movie just seemed to be too serious. It tries to achieve the dark atmosphere of "Seven" without the good acting. The film highlights urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art "subculture" and expects us to be impressed (scared?) By the size of a guy's nose ring. I'm not a movie expert, but the script and performance in this movie is just awful. Dee Snider sees part of the villain, but his acing is actually horrible. I do not recommend wasting time on this unless anything else is available.
