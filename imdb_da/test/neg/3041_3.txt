This is all too klichéd you will turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, with a fair going and someone being killed. This movie would have been better put on this setting. <br /> <br /> So Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend problems. I can't see the point of adding her collapse with her boyfriend in any of the events of history. When Jill returned home, her father sent her to babysit to Mandrakis in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. The kids are sleeping and the girl is cleaning, another empty house aside for their son who is in college. OK. After approx. Half an hour of her stalking around the house, she gets a couple of hangers. Ooh, scary. To whom she turns to rescue, come up with a few high schools about 'love' and anything. Friend leaves and goes to his car. Then she drops her keys. Uhhh ... so the music! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to get them and gets into her car. Which of course does not start. How is cliché it ..? So .. She disappears = D Jill, alone again. Ugh. (Most of this movie is with itself, so there is not much dialogue) So more hangings she calls the police. Who says they can't help her, but call back if she has more problems. Then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or her boyfriends are calling. They have been, but only once. As it should be scary much? Oh, and did I mention? Her friend is now on caller ID and a bit of scary man is coming. She is all freaked out and shyt. <br /> <br /> So skip it. She sees that the light in Mandrakis son's house goes on. So she runs through the woods with music as her companion and enters. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> WHAT IT CALLS, I CAN'T GO !!!!!!!!!
