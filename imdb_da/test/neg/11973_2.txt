Wow! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. If the pictorial opening credits do not tell you that you are in for a good trip, then the diabolic tragic "writing" will certainly. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is bound to a legendary scarecrow as part of his dedication to the baseball team. Then scarecrows go nuts and start exercising people. Should I say more? This movie largely consists of cheap effects that make it look like it was edited with iMovie (note the eerie color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some of the Cinemax specials night. In fact, it is not fair, as the actors did not have much room to work around the immense script. Parts of this movie really look like parody, especially when a character records his guitar and starts to play the worst song ever invented by humans, with the worst lip sync ever performed to follow. "Gore" here is also a big disappointment. In most B-movies like this, there is a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to make up for what the story and the action are missing. Here are things so cheap that it is not even fun. This movie actually makes "Jack Frost 2" look like much fun in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is the "worst you have ever seen" then you probably haven't been deep into the world of straight-to-video B horror. Whether this movie will give you a lot of mental anxiety, no matter what your background is.
