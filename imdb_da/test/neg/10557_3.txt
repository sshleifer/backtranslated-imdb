How did so many talented or at least charismatic actors in this baloney? Nothing is very good with this movie, but the worst thing is probably the manuscript and the control. It is apparently director Damian Nieman's heartbeat when he has both written and directed it (and acted too). He is a short wizard himself and seems to have named signs in the sanctuary of other famous magicians. This was his first feature film, as far as I know, and chances are that it's his last. It's hard to point out what makes it so bad ?? but I want to say the story and the sign are not credible (the manuscript) and the director does not give it a boost (the director). Plus ?? The poker scenes are bad in the worst Hollywood way (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The supposed terms in the film are either completely predictable or incredible. They end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as "a few decent scenes"!
