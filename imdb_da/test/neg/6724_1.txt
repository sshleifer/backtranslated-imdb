I usually really enjoy Steven Seagal movies. They are usually very entertaining and are something of a skill for Aikido. I usually have the way Steven incorporates these martial arts techniques into the battle sequences. But this movie is a really bad movie-making effort and it seems to me obvious that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone lead someone like Steven Seagal and take advantage of his knowledge and competence. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the end of this movie. I went out before the end simply because I couldn't keep more and more on this bad movie. I am sure many people also share my feelings.
