Warning, spoilers ahead (though I doubt anyone hasn't seen this yet). The movie starts quite well, but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny, sugary sweet, predictable and unrealistic 'harmony romance' mess. I think it is very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage, but these problems are never solved but just forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically, as soon as she decides to have a baby behind her back (without even asking) all their problems disappear magically without any trace or explanation. Considering what had happened until that moment, it would have been much more logical if the marriage fell apart instead of becoming a trite and the clich√© having a baby would change everything. <br /> <br /> The two main characters' families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional and do not seem to serve any purpose if they do not look annoyed at the viewer, and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the 'harmony moments' start. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to rip this movie, but at first I expected something more. 4/10 for me.
