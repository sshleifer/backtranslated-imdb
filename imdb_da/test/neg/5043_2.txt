This movie is like porn with all the good parts removed. It's like all the pornstars who won't fulfill their obligations tied together about this horrible, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> This is a useful movie if you are in the mood to torture a loved one (or no longer loved) one. It is important that if you choose to use this film as a torture method, you put in earplugs and put yourself in a blindfold to stay away from going crazy. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice between this movie and The 700 Club ... I would choose Girls Gone Wild. All in all, better if you have drunk. But only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
