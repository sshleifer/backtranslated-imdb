Technically, this movie sucks ... lol. However, it is also fun. Whether it is appropriate fun, I do not know. Terrible in every aspect, it's also the only movie I know of that has 1) a fat kid played by a slender actor in a (very obvious) bold diet, 2) an attractive 30-something actress who plays a character who must be in her late 60s, and 3) most compliments for plastic yard daisies ever. Don't take the movie seriously, just watch it for a laugh .... a great movie.
