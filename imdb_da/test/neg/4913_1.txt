Axar is a horrible movie. The scripture, the story, the actor is simply ridiculous. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer incredible and surprisingly bad plays. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. She is beautiful but has zero-acting talent. The film has a hit song called "Jhalak Diklaja", which is composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I could never understand the hype about this song, which I never found particularly good, even though it is catchy. The movie must be a thriller, but instead it just looks like a cartoon thanks to the horrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheapo at all costs.
