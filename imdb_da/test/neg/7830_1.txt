Asia Argento has never made a movie (as far as I know, and this includes those directed by his own father, Dario), where she does not show all her anatomies at a time. Sure enough, in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever, poor Madsen has come into his office and right here and reminds us that even though her hair is up, she can still hold her finger on her branch for a given second (which she does in such a random "what? I see it really?" kind of). The DVD box, packaging, makes this look like a femme fatal movie so you're waiting to see her transformation into a slim and minimalist killer .. no luck. She is properly, hung on some aging has been and even worse, has no credible ability in physical agility other than (surprise!) To take off all the clothes when a scene allows it. Her accented English would be cool if only she didn't try to make it sound so hit and try to speak like a 12 year old. What about this plot? Weakly mind, but at the same time nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly driven to kill while already having another affair on the go and running some cheap drug deals ... hi? what? has any motivation in this movie to do anything but buy a hamster? The manuscript seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over again (I expected to see the worst thing about this being a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time) - that's nothing happens under the obvious errors of Asia's character, which at any time in the film deliver what the DVD deck promises. She's weak ... but she knows how to kill. she flails a lot. She clapped naked, she clapped half dressed, she even tasted in a woman's death clothes .. she is very diskette and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would have been a good name for this movie .. and a shot of Asia went out looking angry at the cover would have been a better representation ... there are actually shots of her eating airplane food !!! What is it about? <br /> <br /> The final end gives 0 meaning - everyone is just annoying wishy washy in their intention and their accomplishment of all goals. Lester's wife does not deliver any real revenge (taking someone to bad karoek is life threatening but not really valid) .. and Lester just flies around without making much proclamation of anything. Absolutely misleading key art ... yes, we know that Asia lost the baby's fat of her firstborn, but really is a whole movie trying to pretend it is interesting enough to run a movie about a passive aggressive chicken, not worth it That your time. See point without return instead.
