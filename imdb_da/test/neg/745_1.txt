The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. That's the only explanation I have. How do you explain this travesty of a Jane Austen custom? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this film was made as if it were a Gothic novel. The bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive, innocent girl with an overactive imagination, as the novel's novel is ... The actress who played Catherine is just around bug-eyed all the time. Peter Firth sees at least 10 years too old to play Henry, and he actually seemed a little on the gay side to me. I can't see the attraction between him and Catherine. John Thorpe's portrayal was rather weird, but Isabella wasn't actually that bad. But nothing could save this movie of CRAP movies! One more thing - This movie finds a character that is not in the book, a French friend to General Tilney's, "The Marchioness". Why exactly they added her is over me. Must have been drugs. She is frightening beyond belief, with white foundation, red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face (dimples?). You think it would at least be entertaining in such a bad thing it's good "quality, but unfortunately it's not. It's just BAD.
