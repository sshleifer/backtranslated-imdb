As a writing instructor there are two ends, I never allow my students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then I was driven over by a truck." I must now add, "Then I got a bump on my head." I feel it is totally unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and craftsmanship, but in this movie they couldn't or wouldn't do it. I'm not saying it's totally worthless, but it's so predictable in its progress, except the stupid end. There are even gangsters going to the police to get help from this guy. They should have made him immediately. It's just a forgettable, borderline horror / sci fi movie, with nothing new to offer.
