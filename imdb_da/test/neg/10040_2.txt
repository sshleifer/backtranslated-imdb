The filmmaker remained true to the most accurate story of the story published in 1894, which contains an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) entitled "Our Family Problems". For knowledge, this is the only eyewitness account ever written. The filmmaker must be credited for accuracy, but there is very little to say about production and acting quality. The action was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It seems that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a floating plot or storyline. If you need to know the story, read about it, its much more poignant and crucial.
