This is a horrible adaptation of Charles Kingsley's history. The animation is to say it awful. And the songs are a disgrace to movie songs, epsecially the "high cockororim" song that they continue to repeat. I'm sorry about Jon Pertwee and David Jason, 2 of Britain's finest talents, giving the voice of the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries his best to perform in this terrible production, but fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the last movie on this planet!
