I can't believe in any of the results this movie has on the IMDb website! Have I got the special version naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be located in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the British centered references, but if you are elsewhere and you have no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection for catalog, this movie can only be worth 90 minutes of the remaining lifetime ( as long as you have no paint to see drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet pantyhose, and the direction and editing are amazingly ham-fisted. What on earth is Irons doing in this movie?
