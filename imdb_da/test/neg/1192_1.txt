Don't get me wrong, I love the TV series of the League of Gentlemen. It was fun, twisted and totally inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the premise was interesting, and I was looking forward to seeing what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre story was to take them. It was a total disappointment, for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the managers, and it contained only bits to the other characters (why not choose mickey & Pauline, Papa Lazaro or guy and Edward for the mains!?). It was scary in whole, half-baked gags and bad slapstick humor. The real clincher was the regular ridiculous period drama / comedy (and I want to use the word comedy loosely). It distracted from the main story and felt awkward, not to mention painfully unfunny. The movie's direction is horrible, and it often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within a tag. Very hasty. <br /> <br /> So - the three-part Plasticine-esquire monster. What the hell was all that knows? Quite ridiculous, it felt like the men's association felt it at the end. All in all, I found myself looking at my watch and sighed with disappointment throughout my experience of the movie. What was once a fantastic television series has been contaminated by a terribly unfunny movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give it 0 out of 10 I would. Don't waste your money on seeing this.
