George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior movie is a complete waste of time. Why was it even tried? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose boyfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has only a tiny bit of screen time), is abducted at a gas station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy no one would trust in a month of Sunday - he flies like Frankenstein's monster, but without sympathy, and Bridges' play is horrible. Sutherland comes across a little better when his character becomes detective using new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is the obvious need to cater to the Hollywood audience by avoiding the gloomy end of the original movie. Here the end is happy, which seems compulsory and incredible, and completely destroys the story. But at this point the damage has been done as Jeff Bridges turns the bad guy into a big laugh.
