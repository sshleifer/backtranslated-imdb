The good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and he proved it in "Man on the Moon" and in "The Everlasting Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But hey, what can an actor do without good history and proper management. He can do "Number 23". The bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor, overstated director, and he showed it in almost every movie he made. What he did with Batman is just disaster, but probably Batman movies should look good. Well, they didn't. Instead of Gothic and Macabre we got Disneyland. Sure "Falling Down" was great, but can you destroy the movie with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with excellent script? No, you can't <br /> <br /> And so good actor and poor director finally met and made "Number 23" ... The ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know it's silly to begin with, but ... Fingerling's subplot (almost half of this movie) looks like intro to another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, the quality of detective history itself, the quality of the characters, even colors, mood and music, editing and sound mix too! Maybe it works for the game, but it probably does not work in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Mise a scene is so bad that it gets fun. It's not even annoying. Carrey reads down the stairs in the park? Why? Is it natural? No, but it looks good. Why suicide Blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in it, but it still looks good. Guess what it looks like, it doesn't look good. It seems to be unnatural instead. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Why is that so? Who cares, let's continue with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this Fingerling? Private eye on the suicide? Almost trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Scenes when Walter Sparrow argues with his wife about the weather book is really about being the best part of this movie. Instead we get the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no sign of people living in them except the essential items (shoes, photos, etc.) Good luck. Dialogues aren't that bad. But what about V.O? Well that's another story. "There is no such thing as fate. There are only different choices". Captain openly to the rescue! "Number came after Fingerling. And now it came after me". Clich√©. Etc. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the average housewife would break into the public building in the middle of the night. Successful and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> The sub-plot of the dog draws the main character to the cemetery. This is such an old trick and so enjoyable for the author and that it should have been banned. I mean it! <br /> <br /> Flashbacks and editing similar to "what happened in the last episode of X files" are not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. Is it? <br /> <br /> I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but it doesn't. It makes no sense. Told in chronological order is weak and incredible. All the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is the chain of situations that are only poorly written fiction. This could be fun, but - since the whole movie is deadly, it is not. To many coincidences is just bad for every story. And the "mystery"? It is predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Losing touch with reality is a good theme for good movie, but I've never seen anything in Hollywood's productions. If you are interested in the subject, just see "Repulsion" by Polanski or something by David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History of Violence", both films address similar issues that "Number 23" wanted to show. Wanted, but failed.
