I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. It had the potential to be a really cool, hip remake of a cool show, but it was here that fell apart. It was too hip, too cool. First of all, all the cool lines and scenes were shown in the preview trailers, which I had seen many times. And editing was very uneven, so the scenes didn't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place. Claire Danes, who I love as an actress, failed to make this her break through to the previous high school roles. The only bright place was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His somewhat stupid, yet smart style was fun and refreshing. Overall, I would recommend just seeing the previews instead of watching the movie and want it to be more.
