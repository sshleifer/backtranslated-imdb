First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors who appear in this movie, and at the time I rented it, I would like it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason I was so disappointed was that the outer box promised me an exciting thriller. In my view, an exciting thriller for British movies is something of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has very dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an end that will hardly be forgotten at any time soon. <br /> <br /> This movie started with the promising note of being such a movie. We have our protagonist who suspects a man whom he does not like to be involved in a battle and run that killed one of his servants' men. His ideas turn out to be right, but the idea that his wife may be involved does not seem to him until she admits that she was part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good thrill thriller were in place, at this time, but from there I felt the movie took a different direction and became almost a kind of gentle soap opera about who will be with whom and what the love of a genuine relationship is. The movie could have been fun for me if the exterior box had spoken of a twisted beloved triangle and not been labeled as suspense thriller. This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the initial setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the movie's true content. I felt that this movie could have done a lot better than it did. I felt it continued to lead the viewer to a great event that was never realized. So I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked and say it was contrary to my expectations.
