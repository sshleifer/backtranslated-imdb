I always like the Carry On movies with their double-sex sexual engagement dialogue and slapstick comedy moments, but I can see why the critics give this two stars. Basically, many British people are gathered at a coach to take a Spanish vacation to an island called Elsbels to the Palace Hotel. What they did not know is that it is not completely built and they have to share bathrooms with their neighbors, they have crap drawings and many other complications and complaints that owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth) puts on a quite entertaining accent, for example. peace that looks like the bad P word). Contributing to Sid James as Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt, an apparent scream (I can't remember who he is ) Jimmy Logan as Bert Conway, June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques as Floella (a ridiculous character, not as memorable as her usual Matron), Bernard Bresslaw as Brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas as Harry and Patsy Rowlands as Miss Dobbs. I admit it is not good, but there are just enough dialogue gags, and of course Babs in the shower, and goes to her bum with the iconic whistle, and later a quick rip off here bra. Okay!
