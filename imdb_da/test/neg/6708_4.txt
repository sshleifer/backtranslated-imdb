This movie starts with this eerie song that gave me some chills as the song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! It immediately sets the mood! The sequence that follows also shows what to expect! We are aware that a ghost is present! The mystery of this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the plot structure is so complex that it is difficult to understand it! The ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! Only the way it is told us is too abstract! I understand that the director thought he had to keep the mystery as long as possible! The problem is that when certain conditions are revealed, you never get a satisfactory explanation! The motives of the important characters have been omitted, and some questions raised in the movie are not answered at all! Since we do not learn enough about the characters, it becomes difficult to care for them! And as a consequence you will lose interest! Only some scare and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure! Twist is interesting, but no real shocker! The experienced viewer will see it coming! Some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like "Ringu" and is not at all original! Well, it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie! But there is a significant difference! The excitement of "Ringu" was mainly based on this one twist, where the viewer finds out how the characters are killed !! In "Ryeong" (the "Ringu" similar) twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another brittle twist! "Ryeong" depends heavily on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't have enough scare to hold your interest! In short: This is not a scary movie!
