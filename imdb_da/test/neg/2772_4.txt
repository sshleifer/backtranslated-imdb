What I liked most about this flip was the chance to see Joan Woodbury, who awe struck me as one of the many beauties of the Charles Boyer classic "Algiers" as a leading role. She does well as Rita, an orphan who rises up to do good as a crime chief for lady. Her ascent to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford's characters, for example. Mildred Pierce who realizes their ambitions with tough determination and willpower. If you're looking for a movie noir classic, look better elsewhere. On several points, it is difficult to know where this story goes. I first got the impression that it should include Rita's plot of revenge over the father and son who tricked her into raping for a drunken death by the playboy son. But payback time ended up being just a minor point, and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the movie, where Rita is becoming more and more involved in urban corruption. Anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so another view should clear up the dangers. My copy is from a Platinum box set called "Mobster Movies". The picture quality is good, but the soundtrack constantly sucks jumping fragments of dialogue. There are eight movies in the $ 5.50 box, making each movie a reasonable 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as Rita's childhood friend Bob. Alan Ladd doesn't get much screen time. That is Joan Woodbury's picture.
