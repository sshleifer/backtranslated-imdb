With the dialogue in the duplicate version of this movie, I don't think Shakespeare is in any great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been deprived of. His stuff has been taken and it really tastes him. He seems to know who does this even though he is a gyrating, raving entity. I loved the two boring men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor determined to destroy the being. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous cemetery, full of cheap crosses and other junk. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can't begin to reproduce this idioci, including a snake pit, where the good doctor is thrown (there's a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robot, a lot of metal cans with a guy inside. The dialogue is terrible. There are long breaks between speeches, as if someone breaks, feeds them their lines. I love the scene where the two young children accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). Nevertheless, if you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at and never take yourself seriously, see this. Have a few beers first. As a direct line from the mother's grave, "See this and your eyes will soften and your breath will stink." What more can I say?
