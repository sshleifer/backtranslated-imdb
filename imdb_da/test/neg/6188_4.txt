Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. Of course it has some fun moments - the stage in the showers when Robbie Coltraine echo Lon Chaney Jr's horrible werewolf "I can't help myself" is fun. But in the end, the plot, the script and the direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90-year-old nun after 180 "Hail Mary" s. When I was a kid, Carry On movies followed this niche a little better, which is a real sad accusation of a movie with such a promising cast.
