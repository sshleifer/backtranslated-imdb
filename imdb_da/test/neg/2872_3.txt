this movie was really bad. It has the quality that many indie films have: humorous filled with long spaces that are completely boring. Any die-hard BAM skinny fan will prolly like this movie, but then again it's probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to see that I'm a fan of Jackass and was a fan of viva la bam before the scriptural character of that show was thin. To explain why this movie does not work, I just have to say that the assumption itself is played <br /> <br /> A guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. And pretty much the whole movie you've got this Ryan Dunn guy, and Bam Magera jumping around like a merry mischief maker. Dicamillo's performance is at best weird. It is a humorous little unspecific Canadian French accent that is largely the extent of his performance (basically fun for 5 minutes and then it is like "ok you pretend to be alien enough already") Maybe it would work if they were going to parody, but all they managed to do is make a movie with an IQ of zero. I love toilet humor just as much as the next guy, but it's not even lowbrow it's just stupid. The humor that comes from this movie is all over, and the audience, even those who are wise to Magera and the company, are out of joke. <br /> <br /> The next time Magera has delivered a bag of money, let's hope he doesn't blow it on a miserable pet project
