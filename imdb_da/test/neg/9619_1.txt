The old man's mouse in this cartoon wanted you to believe that all men are created just as bad ........... so if we are to kill men to stop Hitler ...... ... we are just as bad as Hitler killed the Jews ........ Well ..... I do not buy it Mr. Mouse ............ but I guess it paints a beautiful picture and makes a cute cartoon ....... but it was not the reality then and it is not reality now.
