Remember the three uranium literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? You will, when you see this widely traded, unintentional hilarious piece of chocolate box adaptation. Most guilty of all is Catherine Z-J, who, without undeniably light on the eye, replaces a heavy dress and looks sultry in fact to make a performance. Played as a melodrama, or Cold Comfort Farm without the jokes, this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a thin ear to dialogue, completely missing out on the novel's sense of irony or tragedy. A shame, considering the quality of the talented talent offered - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh deserves better than this.
