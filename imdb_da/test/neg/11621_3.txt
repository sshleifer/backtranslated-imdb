I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoiler follows. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters now regularly make inexplicable silly things: <br /> <br /> So if Starbuck thinks she knows where the earth is, why not send her into a raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Should the quorum choose their newest member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience under his belt and is a son of a man, the mistrust. Would Adama send Gaeta and Halo with Starbuck, leaving outside senior officials? Would Adama put a man into having sex with Cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I just don't buy any of this. <br /> <br /> Second, while I accept there, have been miracles and references to God until the end of Season 3, it is now all over the top. I started to see BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, not a biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently and wanted some satisfactory explanations about some of the odd developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character in the show, but he now seems to be crazy. Not illogical considering what he has been through, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All characters seem to be just dolls dancing to an unknown third party's desire (some divine entity). This is not a good drama, it is annoying and a written policeman. <br /> <br /> So what are the good points? Good match at the start of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well-acted) when viewed in isolation. A good final scene, a nice clipping curve in a development. <br /> <br /> But this is not Sci Fi, it's become Fantasy. I can't imagine how the authors can regain this.
