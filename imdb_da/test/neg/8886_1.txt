We rented the movie and it is perhaps the worst movie ever. The box they had in the video store had a cold-looking monster on the cover, but in reality the monster was a closet from the black lagoon mask. Terrible, horrible, terrible ... you actually had to rent it, it's so bad. It feels like you're watching a bizzare-o home video.
