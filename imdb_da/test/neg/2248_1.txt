This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enter Nazi-occupied France and begin slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and killing them with baseball bats. While doing jokes, of course. Some say that this movie is a parody of a particular genre. For a parody it is neither witty nor fun. The content is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Below is a subtle political message because it is again "the good guys" who kill "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Can you imagine a story where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this film is exactly about it, with the exception that meets the weird moral expectations of a particular audience: Slaughtering humans is so tough when done by the right people. <br /> <br /> This movie works only because of the hidden Nazi ideology below. It does not consider the enemy as humans. And if the latter were to be an element of the fun, I'm happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American spectators, while a little nudity will reject them. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at worst. Inglorious Basterds is a meaningless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money.
