What a miserable movie took me 3 times to finish it. What I didn't like most was the infantile sense of humor. jokes made by a 10 year old child. not funny. rather annoying indeed, for example, when the detective can't get somewhere in the bar he shouts "she takes it all out" and then they all run "fast foreward" slapstick kinda 'rush. so stupid. And also a guy sitting in the bar smashes fruit to educate his post-traumatic stress disorder. on th ebar! and the bartender delivers him with more and more fresh fruit. it should be fun? and i mean ... i love good ol 'exploitation make flicks, and so many horrible movies, but his one is simply bad. and also "gore" is not so exciting. do not want to. I would not recommend it.
