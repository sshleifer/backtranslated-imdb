This is by no means the stupidest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started to think it was a "skinemax T & A flick", but apart from a few breasts it was. I mean, I get the point of making silly movies to show some sex scenes, as they are the only reason why a movie of this kind can be made. However, this movie has no sex scenes and has no meaning at all. There is no linear time, the scenes travel around like a speed in the wind, people arise for no reason, let it go, and it is never explained, it is never advanced and nothing happens. I have never been so flabbergastet on how bad a movie was until I saw this. Has the instructor himself been in a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I don't know, but it seems he has done some moron proud of this piece of shit when he is still working. I literally walked away from this movie mute, but I still recommend watching it as it should appear in all film schools in the country as an example of what not to do when making a movie. Move over PLan 9 from outer space, you have a new competitor for worst movies ever made.
