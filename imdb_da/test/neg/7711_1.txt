I will stick to bullet points, so here goes: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Trying to be like Resident Evil. 3. Zombies slow and docile one minute next minute Raging lunatics. 4. Never saw the blood clean up so easily! 5. Special effects are not as good as the original "living death day". 6. Doesn't work as well as "Bold and the Beautiful". 7. It seems that it was written in 1 week and made the next week. Basicaly With team plus Special Forces entering a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. Everyone dies except the 2 biggest stars so predictable, though unarmed and swam with the 100s of zombies they survived. But special forces (who were trained in kindergarten school scouts) took only 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons. Also the mandatory jerk on hand to fill holes. Total load on waste.
