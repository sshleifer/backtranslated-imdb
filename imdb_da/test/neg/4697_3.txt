I just came back from seeing the "Comedian". It was okay. It kept me looking at the screen. It's just not the kind of thing I want to pay $ 7 to see. <br /> <br /> I don't understand it would make a good HBO feature. If this was something I saw on TV, I'd be hooked right in. It gives a great look at which comics go through before and after getting on stage. It will interest anyone who likes to see cartoons. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the movies, I like to be entertained. I'm not there to be educated. Now I know what it is for Jerry Seinfeld before going out on stage .... great. But truthfully, I'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about some of it. One thing: With the bad attitude Onry Adams has; I would expect to see him take my order from Burger King before I see his HBO special. He wasn't funny. He is the kind of person you love to hate.
