You thought about "Traumschiff Surprise" that German comedy can't get worse? It may. This comedy is yet another attempt to maintain stereotypes of gay men masked as a good comedy. The original concept (openly gay men in football sports) would have been a great opportunity to delete some stereotypes, but ... The real message of the movie seems to be the way gay men are so different from equal men. Absolutely stupid, of course. Even homosexual treatment is treated as being of lesser value than just sex. This film only attempts to serve just the audience who wants to laugh at stereotypical gay men. Now don't waste your time on German comedy movies!
