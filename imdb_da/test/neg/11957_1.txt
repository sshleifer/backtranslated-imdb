This is a very horrible movie. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, just like this one before, you probably have. You've probably seen Scarecrow 2 made in 2003. Yes, that's what I said, Brian (the instructor) stole the movie idea. And not only did he steal it, he could actually have been able to make it worse. I bet it just, the actors were afraid to tell people they were actually in the movie. I also have to mention that the director was trying to make up for cheesiness by showing as many breasts as possible. Also the kissing scenes were composed as a porn movie. In fact, it's probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie that will never work.
