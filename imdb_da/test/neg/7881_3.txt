Well, how do you make a movie as provocative as possible? This cartoon-like straight shocker tries to have two low-life parliamentary drivers (a prostitute, a newly-raped ex-porn actress, no less) scoffing at a national sex-and-killing spree-men especially. <br /> <br /> Very short game time gives you a hint of the experimental character of this fiercely hardcore "Thelma & Louise" - but it is done without irony or consideration for any possible feminist message ... And since we are not Don't get very close to the protagonists, the violence actually feels subdued and numb - and maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> As a liberal advocate of freedom of speech, I am always delighted when the "serious" film industry dares to contain full sex scenes. But the question is: Does it work for the movie as a whole? Is it good? Here, not much, although we get a new meaning for the term "a shot in the row"! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
