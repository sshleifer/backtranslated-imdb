I found this movie extremely disturbing. Treadwell is misleading and disturbed to the point that is likely to suffer from a mental illness. The recording shown is him and not an actor, yet shows the behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show actual images of a suicide? Let's not pick words. The film shows recordings of behavior that directly led to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think Treadwell is a kind of hero, think again. The shots he shot are about him and not about the bears and the foxes he claimed to help. He made no meaningful study of their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. All he did was around the bush and convinced that he was better than everyone else. The reality is helping to desensitize the animals to humans, putting them at high risk. His own indulgent behavior did not cause his own death, but also his companion's death Amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm. <br /> <br /> But I'm also worried about Werner Herzog's actions by compiling this movie as he did. <br /> <br /> A friend and I have had a long argument about this movie that loved this movie. He believes that seriously disturbed people create interesting topics, and he cites the movie Downfall as an example. But in Downfall they use actors. We didn't see the real Madga Goebells putting cyanide capsules in her own children's mouth. <br /> <br /> There was something about using the right recording in Grizzly Man that reminded me of the terrible football stadium tragedy where people were crushed and the photographers who could have helped, simply opted to continue recording the horror . Herzog's films show us that Treadwell's footage is more about Treadwell. But Herzog did the same. His own personality and opinions are sent in this documentary, which is supposedly about another. Scenes like the one in which he listens to the tape is not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because coroner had told us. We didn't need Herzog to beat a tear with one of Treadwell's former friends. It didn't add the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie showed us that Treadwell was very self-sufficient, but it also showed us that Herzog is too.
