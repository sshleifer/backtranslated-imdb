The action was very subordinate. You had Costas Mandalar, who appears as Triple H's stupid shaker brother, a Scott McMahon look-like as his deputies, which I think you should worry about, but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. You have the stupid lesbians, not that I have anything against lesbians, I am not just stupid, continuing to run around in a pencil shirt and a grunge hat like asking if anyone saw his dead lover. <br /> <br /> Villainen could be scary and there is a moral story somewhere to try to fight age and death, but it is lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley quickly points out to be the way back to the city, while there is clearly the city's light behind it. <br /> <br /> Also a mispronunciation of Ed Gein, but pronounced it Gine. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We have had our share of Monster's Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you are going to use it, you say it right. <br /> <br /> God Why do I see all those horrible movies. Oh yes, I am a glutton for punishment and I look at these so you don't have to.
