This movie was absolutely horrible. Stupid premises and terrible action by everyone. The one who wrote this trash should be hung. Reminds me of a hack student movie, BUT worthy. Who ever produced this must give up now. I know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think of this "amazing" as some think "Dune (1984)" was great, take care of the horse and watch some real movies. Okay, the action was tolerable, and with better direction could have been much better, but it did not so it suffers. I do not know how much more I can say about this waste of film, except that it is completely destroyed. Anyways it was terrible and I recommend avoiding it like the plague if you come anywhere near "dreamland", rent the movie next to it instead.
