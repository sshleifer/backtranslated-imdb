Apparently, episodes from Gangbuster's TV show on the big screen are cut off. While this was often done in the 50s and 60s because people did not have a TV or a color TV, and the producers wanted an increased return on their investment (big screen sale or if it went to the small screen resale of a series that are not in syndication), the results were usually less than the sum of their parts. The only time I ever saw it was how many sub-stories were put together (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or in the case of horror rhetoric (The Veil and 13 Demon Street). Here is the effect of having stories about American criminals in the 20s and 30s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) Cut together with each other as a narrative talk about how the FBI chased them down. It is a strange collection that does not work completely because it is clear that there are things that do not belong together. More than once I saw the TV strange because things didn't work right. In fairness I will not describe the fairness of the production as it was the early television (and the series) was like. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be honest, the episodes of the series I've seen look better from a single episode where we don't expect so much. Considering the choice, I would rent DVDs of the show instead of this movie.
