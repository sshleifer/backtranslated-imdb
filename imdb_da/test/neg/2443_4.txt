Miserable movie. Not even to be compared in a breath with "killing a mockingbird" or "in the heat of the night." Yes, there are racial prejudices, but the film is most ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Come on. Would you really have Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, guarding a prison to avoid lynching? Patterson today played everyone's mother and was the hostess of "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. <br /> <br /> Imagine digging the body so it doesn't come out that the black man's gun killed a white man? Claude Jarman Jr., who was so amazing in 1946's "The Yearling" appears in this mess. He still had these sad eyes. My eyes would also be sad if I thought in this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> For me it was no more than a Faulkner flop all the way.
