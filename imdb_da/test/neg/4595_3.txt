I look at the non-classified version of this movie, and as a person who has studied Speck's life and crimes closely, I must say that this film is a flawless but ambitious take on the real story. While you catch Speck's true horror and murders, this movie gives the following erroneous errors. 1. Speck did not inject drugs on the crime scene as shown in the film. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and pills that rarely took drugs via syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived Speck's massacre did not slip down the stairs and under the couch in the living room as shown in the film. This would have been impossible. In real life she hid under a bed, while Speck methodically eliminated her 8 victims. 3. The movie shows Speck as violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In fact, Speck was at first calm and gentle, soothing the women that he wouldn't hurt them. He was able to tie each one up. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinking film depicts him being. FBI profiles Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 80s and said that Speck not only knew why he committed the murders, but that he was not interested in learning why, nor could he shed light on why. Speck was known to be below average intelligence and not the philosopher who tells this movie. If the story wasn't so tragic and horrible, the voice would be ridiculous. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is sufficiently threatening and cold blood, though I don't think the real Speck was so forward in his violence. There was no doubt that he was a very violent person when he was under influence, but he was also known to be a rather slender con man who could make people fit before they fell victim to them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the movie. She is a very good actress. If you are bad at all, you can't see this movie. It is very graphic and disturbing.
