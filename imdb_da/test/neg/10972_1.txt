I can only think of a reason why this movie was released. Taking advantage of Guy Pearce's forthcoming fame. This movie has no benefit whatsoever and unnecessarily destroys Errol Flyn's memory. The gay meeting was pure speculation. The contempt shown for Flynn in this movie can be seen. An easy way to seduce an actor who died years ago. Terrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this complete trash can. See my wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.
