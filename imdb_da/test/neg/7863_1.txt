This movie is so bad that it actually gets fun. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The funny thing was that the trailer had scenes in what was not in the movie. Just by watching the trailer I would have saved a lot of my time. It actually showed everything that happened in the movie except for the conclusion, and it was so obvious. It is honestly hard to think of a reason why this movie was made. This is just so bad. Terrible. <br /> <br /> I would give it 0 out of 10 if that were possible. There is nothing else to say about this movie.
