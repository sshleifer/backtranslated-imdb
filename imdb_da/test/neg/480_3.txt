As a Bruce Campbell fan for almost two decades, I was thrilled to have a chance to see his latest movie on the big screen with the man himself present. Unfortunately, "Man with screaming brain" was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Seen in Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi channel makes its original films on Saturday night - "Man with screaming brain" is a curious mix of 50's B-movie screams, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick and exaggerated slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If it does not make sense, then it does not "man with screaming brain". Campbell plays a pharmaceutical business executive who visits Bulgaria with his foreign wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former communist country's semi-finished metro system. The two coincide with a former KGB agent who switched cabin driver and all three meetings ultimately put their hands in the hands of a devoted gypsy woman. A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his fat assistant (Ted Raimi) who have developed a technique for allowing tissue grafts without the possibility of rejection, stealing the bodies and placing part of the cab in the brain of Campbell's damaged skull. Also they put their wife's brain in a robot body they are just having at hand. <br /> <br /> Campbell escapes, and with a quickly resettled skull and cab rhythm - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - echoes in the head, sits down to find and kill the gypsy. But his first wife does the same Just as he played his own evil hand in "Evil Dead II", Campbell is capable of getting his body inhabited by more than one mind. At times, "Screaming" comes closest to another Steve Martin movie, "The Man with Two Brains" as it also takes a stupid approach to the 50s sci-fi clich√©s. However, it is trying too hard for a little, and it is double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian oaf, which gets too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) In the end, it's neither scandalous (or fun) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B -film pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening when it was stopped when I feared to say "Gee, Bruce, it was really ... something." <br /> <br /> Perhaps best praise I can give it as a movie is that at least the pictures are stuck on the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse."
