You know, after the first Chuck Norris movies, I got so I could tell that a movie was produced by the Golan Globus even though I voted in the middle without looking at the credits or the title. What I could say more was the Golan Globus within one minute of the screen. Something about the history structure, the silly relationships between the characters, the modest dialogue, the wood effects (spiked with the unique real horrible achievements), the scene tempos and the rhythms that made Albert Pyun, resembled John McTiernan, the paper-thin plots and non-ready-for-prime -time battle choreography ... Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject and point of view. What can you say it should work for them as they have literally produced dozens of movies. You go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you get. And it's not brain food, people. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a wide range of products from the GG sausage factory and offers the typical limited pleasures of the movie guests' palate. You have a bad ninja, slice up the police and criminals and everyone else who gets in the way. You have a good ninja, promised to stop him. You've got a Westerner thrown into the mix so we Americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured that "we can still beat the annoying Oriental in their own game." You have a love interest (which is usually also the worst actor / res in the movie) fence with the hero. You've got your endless string of attacks, murders and protracted shots of men swinging in pain, while an arrow or throwing star sticks out of their eye, neck, or chest. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in packages that call a ninja a 'Son of A B * tch' and throw a round, only to have his * ss handed over to him. You have a final confrontation between the good guy and the evil guy who continues for 20 minutes and just kind of stop as a RoadRunner comic instead of reaching a climax or resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a little different because the plot is about a scrappy female athletic type obsessed with the bad ninja so she ends up killing many of the police and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in Suits while he is under his spell. But all the other elements are there, so formal in their way as a Kabuki game or a Noh drama. <br /> <br /> I actually thought Lucinda Dickey was quite sympathetic in this movie. She is nicely muscular and curvy, has large cheekbones and some athletic 'ooomph' for her movements, and you can actually suspend faith enough to accept that her character can make some of the feats she draws in the movie. She can almost, but not completely, wear this thing. An extra start for her participation and good energy. Of course, Sho Kusugi is in here and he dominates almost the last 10-15 minutes of the film. And only to show you how 3-rate and uninspired GG movies are, the editor and editor of the latest climate match between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with many reaction pictures of Dickey and her boyfriend who sees life and the death game with a mild expression bemusement. I'm serious ... for all the emotions and reactions they point to the case, they could look at a sea turtle in an aquarium at Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey must feel when she saw the finished product - she would probably run the editor through with a katana for real, because these reaction images make her look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it is definitely a waste of time. Maybe if you are a Sho Kusugi fan, or even a Linda Dickey fan, you will find it worth your while.
