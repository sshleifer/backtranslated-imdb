Barney and Friends ... Dora the Explorer of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit it. As a child, barney was my ultimate hero. I had my barney plush toy and I used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotapes. maybe because it was so sugar-coated and mind-numbing. <br /> <br /> But when I was 7, I started to hate barney. everyone in the school would dis barney, and I went along with it (mainly because it was fun) and that's what small boys do. But a few years later I discovered something else about barney, which I will never forget. <br /> <br /> A person who was known at IMDb when Angel_meiru made an essay for school and explained the dangers of seeing the barney and he or she wrote it in the message board. many of these dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur that magically comes to life during a day at school. he is apparently educational, or so says Sheryl Leach (Barney's Creator), but really, all I can remember him teaches me is that magic can solve something, which is not true. <br /> <br /> To finish this comment, I'd like to tell you a little story. There was once a young boy looking at a particular episode of barney. One day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him. I do not know the result (but it is safe to assume that the child died), but why was he abducted in the first place? because he saw Barney and his friend's episode titled "A stranger is a friend you haven't met yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
