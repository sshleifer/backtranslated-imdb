Well, here we have a zombie film that may not even be much of a zombie film. The whole movie is put in a zombie plague near the future, but the film does very little with this concept. Instead, it focuses on a zombie hunter trying to get revenge and money back from a group of other bounty hunters. How good is money anyway when almost the whole world has gone to hell and the cities are mostly deserted. And why pay money to people to kill zombies in the first place. As if people would not continue to kill these dangerous threatening monsters when they are not paid. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the story of "The Quick and the Undead" is far from a tight one. It is of course also not filled with the most logical and interesting moments, figures or dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's still not a horrible movie. It is certainly not as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. It's a good look, or said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it. It's effects can be a little overused, but still they are pretty nice, like the makeup effects too. <br /> <br /> The movie was still not what I hoped for. Its title may indicate that the movie is wild, wild west, in cowboy's days, but the title is just a misleading one, who is undoubtedly chosen to cash in on it. I fell for it, expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie horror flick. <br /> <br /> For fans of the zombie films, this movie will mostly be a disappointment. Of course, it doesn't add anything new to the genre, but neither does it have enough of the genre itself to be considered a good one. <br /> <br /> Not quite unpacked but also far from a recommendable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
