I made a screen test and read the manuscript for this turkey in 1988. It was awful then and even worse now - I saw it on VHS on the local HollowWood Video and said, "Oh, what do you mean for angry". Yech. They had to shoot most of it in Mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of the stars covered bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink. The movie's plot is ok, but I know that the author intended to have a spyware thread running throughout. <br /> <br /> Dr. O ended up being a cartoon character. He still has to swirl in his grave in the Kremlin wall. <br /> <br /> Technical failures were the whole movie, not only with the infant's atomic technology, but with the uniforms, insignia and military jargon. They were too cheap to hire a professional military advisor, of course. Even Mr. Newman's August and expert presence could not have saved this bird from being filled for Thanksgiving.
