Hi, prominent doctor James Coburn (as Peter Carey) arrives to accept a position as a pathologist at a Boston hospital. Almost immediately, Mr. Coburn beds beautiful nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (like Georgia Hightower). While sleeping with Mrs. O'Neill, Coburn is awakened by an emergency involving a soft abortion - the fifteen-year-old who is bleeding to death is the daughter of the hospital's major donor, Dan O'Herlihy (as JD Randall). Coburn does not believe in the man arrested, Dr. Pal James Hong (as David Tao) committed the crime; Although Mr. Hong acknowledges performing illegal abortions on the site. While trying to clear his friend, does Coburn awaken through a thickening? <br /> <br /> **** Carey Treatment (3/29/72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
