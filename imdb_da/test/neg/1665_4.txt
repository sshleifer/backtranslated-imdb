André Roussin was a specialist in the French call "Theater de Boulevard": playing where you find the eternal triangle: husband / wife / (male or female) lover. Many of his plays gave Elvire Popesco some of his best parts on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason for seeing them, because Roussin is not Sacha Guitry, with a long shot. The French audience remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". <br /> <br /> Still with me? Roussin's plays were not made to be filmed. And this is pretty mediocre material, even though the writers call Lewis Carroll for their rescue. I like Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is eye candy. But this can be their worst movie to be raw, predictable - even the native (Bola-Bola) intervention is ridiculous - a knockabout farce around a Menage à Trois on a desert island where Granger would be a kind of Robinson, Niven, his Friday And Gardner his girl Friday.
