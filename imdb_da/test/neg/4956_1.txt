It is embarrassing that I had 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop in the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really fascinated by the half-necked image of the 'star'. <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie shows what the new york film school and master's father's happiness - judging at the cinema of this clown head - can do for you and you and you expect it to be, what we have here and also a photo-sketched image of the driver "actor" with the other's body in a still image that does not happen anywhere in the film. it is strange cause in so many ways that it had money thrown at the obviously low budget money bucks, but from the start, when all the extra features laugh in their scene of terror it should not be well would have had some charm if it had made for 2 cents! in short order i skipped scenes and quickly forwarded to see the picture on the box, that was all i really worried about. strange, why do i just rent a porn or something? But wow there is bad acting, it's fun, I guess and bad acting, it's just bad. Robert Englund is quite pathetic in this with everyone else. It makes you appreciate the more not so straight to video horror out there. . . among most of which I would not bother with. shoulda looked at hellraiser 3 if i wanted to see an 8 pack! I can imagine electing old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store being the principal tenants of this, and they should start a class dress!
