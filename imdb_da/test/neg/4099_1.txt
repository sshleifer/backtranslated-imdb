This picture is a bad and blasted rip off of the Michael Pohl short film EXTINCT from 1995. While Michael Pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film setting, a sound of tundra's plot was poorly adapted from Pohl's story and not suited to a full length feature film would expect from a great Hollywod studio. The tragic flood situation that destroyed Prague's seats was only a bad link in a long-established film production chain in this case. For a studio to release such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a study that broke new effects grounds with shows like BABYLON 5 in 1993. On television. Visual effects for TV shows groundbreaking CGI in episodic television in the mid-nineties were far more sophisticated than what comes to the screen in this picture. In cases like this, sad as it may be: Can the movie.
