I happened to rent this movie with my sister hoping to watch a great entertaining movie, it was humorous, but my expectations were down. This film was beyond disgusting and disgusting for a PG-13 movie, this should have been rated R for the many mature references that took place in this movie. I would not recommend letting a 13 year old teen see this. Although no one under the age of 17 looks at this movie, beware of a really silly movie, there is no humor in the movie, just a bunch of obnoxious sexual references, including a small piece of pedophilia, something that should not even be fun about. <br /> <br /> I want to know what happened to PG-13 movies that were actually safe for a 13 year old? This is beyond a regrettable movie and should be reviewed again.
