This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This movie makes Friday the 13th look like a Best Picture nominee. The action is shit. The special effects are crap. No one dies for like 40 minutes, and all people make them look bad. The only thing that saves it is the ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity that goes on. The funniest part is watching the heroine "fight" the attacker. She had to be educated, but she is struggling as a 70-year-old. They use pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who die to the point where you don't even know why they die. I love slashers, but it's just shit.
