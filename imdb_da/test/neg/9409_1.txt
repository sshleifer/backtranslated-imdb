For all the casting and crew members working on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience hoping for a fair return on the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (for me) is that we see an extremely talented actor, Pacino, apparently playing a parody of himself. That was what was with me as a total mystery. I fully understand the need for film industry people to work and thus live. What I do not understand is an artist of Al Pacino's talent that prostitutes and embarrasses with this level of mindless unwanted. Hopefully he will choose better value projects in the future ... and for value, save time and hard earned money. Skip this !! Let's send Hollywood and Al a message.
