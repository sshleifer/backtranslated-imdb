I just watched Congo on DVD. In most cases, I love these kinds of movies, but this one is different. It made me write my first comment on a movie on IMDb. I was amazed at how such a team of experienced filmmakers could bring this movie as a result. You can see there was a lot of money for this production, but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. And as producer Frank Marshall gave us lots of good movies to watch; he should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This shows how difficult it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can't cook, stay away from the kitchen. If you can make a proposal, don't spend your money on this. If you want to see it, watch it first on TV and make your own mind.
