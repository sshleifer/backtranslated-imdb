When I bought the DVD, I saw so much of what I did in a sense of duty to my wallet. <br /> <br /> The reason is Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falling in love and marrying her. Complications follow. <br /> <br /> Douglas is usually considered an intense actor, given to dramatic roles, sometimes quite, sometimes rat. He is not bad in this thorough cartoon. The problem is that the part is not a special cartoon, nor is it anything else. The plot falls on. A dozen "quirky" characters come and go - most prominent Keenan Wynn as a Douglas friend who does nothing but makes evil comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it might still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog, but there's no one to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not delete that bar. Here's what I thought of as an entertaining line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and notes that she has never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn asks if she liked Douglas earlier book, "Last Year's Love." Yes, of course she did. "Well, most of 'last year's love' was done in the beach house." Ha ha. Nice cast, including support, but an erroneous comedy. There have been better sitcoms on TV.
