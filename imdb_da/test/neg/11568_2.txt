Cheap, lovely bad cheese from the 80s, decade of cheese. I first saw this first rude and un-MST3K'ed, and it was pretty much fun even without the comments. The plot (as it is) is about a post-apocalyptic world where the AI ​​robots revolted (sound familiar?) And virtually destroyed everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad that no one can breathe. The few people left are acting as slaves for a mystery called the dark, which seems to be the sub-computer and part of the organic being. The "air slaves" work to produce energy because this is in return for breathable air. Every once in a while, the darkest one of the air slaves has the fight against death, so no one will rise as a leader in a rebellion against the dark. That's the so-called serious thing. On the stupid things, like the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothes, all of which are sporting, including car sackcloth 'fur' garments, linen dolls, and spangly stuff and feather boas (worn most by Dark One's henchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent) . Or the wood-acting and stylized lines exerted by all the so-called "actors" whose dialogue is high on pretension and low sense. Or the dime shop, for example, including pink socks with teeth glued to them for "deadly" sewer hoses, a bomb made of tense piano wire and a can of canned and awful "mutants" with Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <A band of air slaves follows their leader, a mysterious wand who has adapted to the outside air to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark. The guy's name is Neo, explaining where the Wachowski brothers got the idea for the Matrix. They meet with a group of Amazon's along the way, with the obligatory battle scene where the woman is bestowed (of course). Has anyone else ever noticed that in any Amazon movie or t.v. Show ever produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butter kicked by either men or women? Amazon's are just pansies, I think. <br /> <br /> This band of particular warriors makes their way through Central Park ... errr ... they ravaged countries beyond the last standing city (great way to save money on dull paintings of a destroyed New York City , anyway) and go into the sewers leading to the power plant, where the dark and his go-go girl henchwoman Valeria hangs out. Here, they overestimate such wild animals as sock socks, a huge spider that no one sees, and the falling lobster robot, which is one of Dark On's personal guard. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl taken by The Dark because he had created a way for people to breathe in the air, sees that her father has been "consumed by the dark a true form", which means he is eaten of a giant avocado until only his head protrudes. The three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a couple of switches, and the robot holocaust does not die with a slap but with a nap. The two people offer some amazing wood last lines and that's it. The end.
