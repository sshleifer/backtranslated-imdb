It is not too bad, but ultimately lacks the quality of the Australian series. <br /> <br /> The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the filmmakers think too much about cinematography (it should look like a home video), and it's like a serious version of Kath and Kim ... it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Being Kath and Kim is too normal. Kath and Kim must be two curved, middle-aged women who think they are warm and wearing ridiculous clothes. There is no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. Kim's fat friend is not fat at all, and she's not even stupid. She is a stereotypical black / latino chick. <br /> <br /> It's just not as stupid or fun as the Australian series. It doesn't compare. Nothing is the same. I admit that this show is pretty fun at times, but it's NOT something like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American take on a bogan family. They failed. It must be really stupid and fun, but the actors are not stupid! For me, this is just a typical American television show. It's a disappointment if you want it to be something like the Aussie show. <br /> <br /> 2 Stars because it's an OK show, just not something it should be.
