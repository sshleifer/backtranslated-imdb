"To You was one of the worst movies we have ever seen. It fails in every respect. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress ...) in Waterworld. By comparison, this movie is Dungworld. When a character stumbles Once, or even twice, during a movie, you can understand it, but Jeanne's character falls, trips, so often she may have a bit of Jerry Lewis in her. Falling probably blocked, choreographed, and repetitive, and practiced, although this is bad enough for a movie, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going for a smoke or trying to find a place To smoke If the movie was a diatribe to have some place to smoke - Ok - BUT it is not. <br /> <br /> For a long time, this movie is running, it is too long with 10 minutes past the running time. Br /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST seems to be in a public forum meeting. end the life into the character. Oh, it's almost as convincing as her scene shouts at Michael Douglas in the Basic Instinct - hmm, about other thinking, not really. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and is caught in nicotine abusers anonymously or forced to see outbreaks of HOOPER (Burt Reynolds). And even then you should throw a coin or go to bed.
