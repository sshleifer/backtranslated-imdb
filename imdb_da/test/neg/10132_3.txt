Natalie Wood portrays Courtney Patterson, a polio-activated songwriter who tries to avoid becoming a victim of being involved in her first love affair. Her partner is lawyer Marcus Simon, who is played lukewarm by Wood's spouse, Robert Wagner. The film is severely cut, but the majority of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand from the director, allowing Wagner to consistently somnambulate and put waste into a solid and nuanced performance by Wood, who also supplies a fine soprano. The manuscript is a little tired, but Wagner's dramatic shortage is persistently in place when he gets a free hand to impose his crooked stare at Wood, who is supposed to counteract an actress. The progression of their relationship is unfairly presented, and this combined with choppy editing results in the viewer being less than sure of what is going on, as the motivation is almost ignored in writing. Although it is largely rude, the film scene shines on a short scene when Wood is placed in a courtyard, and after the sound of a shutter door remains in the middle while the camera's eye steadily pulls away, showing her helplessness and weakness. More controlled direction would have allowed performing artists, even the limp Wagner, to scale their plays with an engaging relationship; as it was released, there is mostly a huge lack of commitment.
