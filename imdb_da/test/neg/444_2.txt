God who sucked. You can't finish a horror movie with a happy ever family setting. Yeash. I was kind of ambivalent to go into the final act. But my god. He did not have to kill the girl, she did not die, the ghost father did a cure (it makes no sense, for his spirit would have been liberated after the child killed all the bad werewolves). What a junk fun. This is the worst horror movie I've seen for a long time, and I've seen many horror movies. This is a blow in the face of Landis and everyone else involved in American werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope it ruined every single career in Julie Delphy. And CGI: Kind of new and beautiful back in 1997, but today it just looks like London's artificial dentures / make-up work. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I've scared some people off. Get the original instead, or don't mind The Howling. Or do not see American Idol reruns. Just don't see this mess.
