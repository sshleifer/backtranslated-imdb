Similar story line, done many times before, and this was no improvement. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes into this and you should pretty much be able to turn it off - the end was deja vu again. The only morality I could see from this is: - stupidity + criminals are not equal success - if he screwed you before, he will do it again
