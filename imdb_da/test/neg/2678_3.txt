Scanning through the comments does not seem to be much love for this movie, and it is not very difficult to see why it is nonsense. <br /> <br /> Now, let me first say that the finished product was damaged in a number of ways by Donald Pleasance's death (Dr Loomis) in post production. This required a resumption of the movie's conclusion with Loomis to buy the farm and took away what was to be a double twist at the end with Micheal swapping places with mysterious "Black Man" and I'm not Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now to the story. The fifth film ended up quite unsatisfactory with Micheal Myer's escape from prison with the mysterious black man. It turns out that this man knows Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in Parts 4 and 5, but here played by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from dr. Wynn's lair, and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she had got the baby, so now he needs to track the baby so he can kill his big nephew. <br /> <br /> We hear a bit of ridiculous explanation for Micheal's evil, involving Gaelic curse down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast from Micheal's hometown for some reason, giving Micheal some more unfortunate victims. In the end, the film, like this review, is vague, confusing and pointless with a very anticlimatic end. <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes and nudity. Bad plot, colorful effects, with some good running of the mill's slasher kills, but seriously lacks in motivation. For what was to explain everything, it was only some new issues that made parts 4 and 5 meaningless and was a bad way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and his career.
