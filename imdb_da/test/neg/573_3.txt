This is a movie about people who receive a love letter. No one knows who sent in and no one knows who it is. A good cast led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. However, this is a very bad plot. As an example, the Capshaw character, one of the leading citizens of a small New England town, takes up an immature college student working in his bookstore in the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the city's firefighter, who loves her. If it is not the epitome of stupidity, I do not know what is. Just an example of how deaf this movie is. Seeing Kate Capshaw jog is a pleasure, but you immediately realize she's never jogged one day in her life. Another obviously drowsy part of a dopey movie.
