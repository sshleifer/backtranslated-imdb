And you know why? Because they believed (or at least did horror fans think) that a bunch of vile, foul-mouthed, screaming teens, some stupid demons (where do they come from? What are their purposes? Who knows?) And a dark mansion are all you have to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules and an invention. This flick has a scene that lives up to its reputation (lipstick scene, of course) and a few fun moments (the grandson's description of his mother's cookies, Linnea Quigley's "don't look at me" scene). It also has more profanity than any movie I've seen since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs". Literally, every fourth or fifth word is a "f ***" or a "b ****". Then again, when a movie begins with FOUR false scares in the first 5 minutes, you don't know to expect something that looks like good movie creation. (* 1/2)
