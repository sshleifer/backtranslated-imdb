"Sex and the city" has some good things that go after it. The problem is that it is saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the ultimate assessment and review for its six seasons. The good thing about "SATC" is that many of the conversations are true to life, the romance stories are interesting, and the characters are fun. The bad thing is that few women work like complete whores. These four women have so many partners, even lesbians in some episodes that you have no choice but to roll your eyes on the absolute absurdity. Men on the show are mostly depicted as shallow, degenerate, liars, cheating and buffoons. The evil language that these women use is far greater than what a normal conversation entails. Why do the authors do these things? Obviously, being over-the-top and getting your attention. Another thing that bothered me (without destroying) is how some conditions ended. They simply didn't really call me or to others I discussed this with. <br /> <br /> But even though I gave the show 2 stars in the end, I'm glad I watched the show. I have actually seen each season several times. I recommend the exhibition to anyone who will not be offended by strong profanity and soft drink pornography. I could have done less with the offensive language and nudity and sex acts, but the romance was very good and the saga ends quite well.
