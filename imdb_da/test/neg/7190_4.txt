Okay, everyone is so excited about this movie, I hardly dare add a negative review, but I just don't enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I must say first I watched the movie in Russian language overdub so I would have missed some dialogues but not much. <br /> <br /> Beautiful things first. There are some hilarious moments (eg the Elvis impersonator). The actors look good, also the Russians. Efremova is fantastic and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the downsides of this movie. Primarily. There is hardly any history and the end we already know: Yeltsin wins. So no drama or excitement. They tried to solve this problem with a new affair between the above actors, but this story kind of evaporated. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians at the political and community level portrayed in this movie are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous party. I am willing to believe that flying in some spin doctors from the states helped Yeltsin win his campaign, but the real interesting issues to be addressed are: Who funded the campaign, what did they receive, how was the opposition handled apart from flying some advertisements? So what we have here is a movie that is loosely based on reality (but wondering dodges everything that can make the movie either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without plot or outbound.
