I watched this movie because it had a huge person and was labeled as a monster movie. I don't understand why it's called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the movie was relationship problems, and people believed that a woman was a luney because she saw a space ship accident with a huge inside for an unexplained reason. The action started a few minutes towards the end. Since the woman was killed, isn't that the murder? Couldn't they have done anything else besides murdering her? If you see this because you expect it to act because it's labeled as a monster movie, don't see it. It's not a monster movie. It's a drama.
