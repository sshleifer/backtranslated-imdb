An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes and artist and then discovers herself and returns to the states so that he can do things right with his former friends. I have to keep in mind that the people who rate this movie so high are all X-Files fans, even though there are no foreigners or serial killers in it. Don't be fooled, this movie blows lumps. <br /> <br /> The story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. What it does is drill you. For all the dramatic talent in the movie, it's just not interesting. I asked the whole movie where the sex addict Duchovny was going to smash someone. Maybe he did it behind the scenes; they should have filmed it instead. What comes across is a story of a self-confident artist who cares about minor incidents in his life and wants to make them right in some way - even if they didn't seem to start off wrong. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a great secret in the first few minutes. It's just a guy thinking that his life is just as interesting to you as it is to him. It is not. <br /> <br /> I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims he wrote the script for a week, it's totally credible. The guy can act, there is no doubt, but writing and correcting is obviously beyond his talents. Why Hollywood holds green lights these self-discovery stories are beyond me. I discover myself in the shower every morning, but I don't want to make a movie about it. Mine would probably be better than this one; at least there would be some nudity.
