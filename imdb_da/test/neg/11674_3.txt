I feel horribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch pic was enchanting, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, this one is only colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but of course depressive) and is trying to play a shy and boring girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the enker role a double-sided depth by "playing" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta even though it was not possible to sing - crazy! She only sings a song - the title role of a Lehar operetta, it's really fun! The only really good thing is the big drum scene at the end: glamorous! And - after seeing this scene - look at the introducing roller scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Any similarities?
