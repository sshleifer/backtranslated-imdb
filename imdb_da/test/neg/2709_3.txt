I actually planned to watch this movie when I noticed it in my TV guide, but after approx. 5 minutes decided time is definitely more valuable than "Who's That Girl" could ever be worth. Describing how bad Madonna's plays look is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever recorded on film. This crap is an insult to film and intellect. I almost never! Consider a movie, I can't see from start to finish, but in the present case it's previously impossible. 2.10
