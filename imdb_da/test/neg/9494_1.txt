The revisionist story - which makes the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic - is scary enough. But the horrible plays, amateur movies and horrible copying make this movie painfully bad. The only reason to keep an eye out is that almost all the women in the film are beautiful. And, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands tied overhead, apparently does not detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that producers were filming the most in Russia, choosing women for their looks - and willingness to work cheaply - rather than acting ability. If you decide to see this because you have nothing better to do or are a movie studio looking for bad examples, you are accelerated through every scene that does not involve nudity.
