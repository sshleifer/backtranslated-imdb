I am very interested in animal children, and I have read many Edger Rice Burrough's novels - but this horrible movie couldn't keep me interested, nor did I lose all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. I only managed to sit through the Africa section and John's first days in Scotland. Let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright stupid'! The actors in monkey suits resembled extra-large chimpanzees, rather than large monkeys (there is a difference). They do not move with the grace of a wild animal. (For comparison, see some of the better Planet of the Apes movies where they trained their actors to move the same way). The monkeys eat large haunches of meat - not a common monkey practice as far as I know. I'm a sucker for animal stories, but the manuscript didn't make me interested in the monkeys. The great white hunters of the expedition who find John Clayton are charicaturish altogether. Clayton's parents were shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it's a very long walk down the river to get to the shore - give me a break! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even the people who think it is an excellent movie admit it is not an action movie. Far from. It tries to be a character study - unfortunately the rather stupid part is dominant! I haven't read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful action and heroic purpose! This movie is just not there.
