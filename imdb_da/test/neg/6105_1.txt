I don't know which Chasidik movement was this movie about? I saw this movie a year ago. I am an orthodox woman living in an orthodox chasidic? community And I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! It's so far away from reality, it's scary! The director could at least hire a Chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation before making a "realistic" film about ultra orthodox! For example, Meirs Davening (Morning beans)! Or a Jewish wedding, or a Mikveh (ritual bath) customs. <br /> <br /> Movies are full of technical inaccuracies .. but it is not those who bothered me. It is the spiritual side. Orthodox are depicted by the Taliban. Woman is powerless while men are the ultimate rulers! Please! No one can force a Jewish girl to Chuppa against her will! We, Orthodox, also live by the law (Halacha), which clearly indicates human responsibility towards his wife. No one beats and no rape! And no man (even Rabbi) is allowed to burst at the woman in Mikveh. And Balanit is not handing over the woman's head while taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body at once! Director tried to bash Ultra Orthodox clearly! But could he at least do it in a good and more educated way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Sweet! But not credible.Dialogues are long and boring. The end completely sucked. For all that drama, at least I had the hope of a good ending, for all that was sitting, I felt I deserved it! It was clear that someone was trying to make a good consciousness calming film for less attentive Jews or perhaps for non-Jews. (Look at the fundamentalists, they are so evil and mean ...) and they succeed! Far short: The hope for a fine European film (Kane level) instead got a tradition that was bashingst, unrealistic and mistakenly guiding junk. I believe that today we live in a free time like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer.Rivka made his choice. Brand made his. Many people from not observing backgrounds choose Orthodox Judaism these days. Because in this evil world, religion can be a good gateway!
