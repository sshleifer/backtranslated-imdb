I mistakenly thought that this was the 70's art movie about the bed eating people who sounded interesting. It is not. Interestingly, I mean, let alone about a male bed. <br /> <br /> I suppose Stuart Gordon puts his name on this in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Troma" on almost everything that has been shot with a video camera in interest to build a franchise library. A little more can be said about this opus, except that the time is less than 90 minutes. Of course it is about a bed haunted by a man's spirit or something that once killed a woman with a pearl and long false eyelashes. Along the way we get ** a five minute opening credit sequence (is it for "Lawrence Of Arabia" as long?) ** A killer with Marylin Manson contacts killing using the same technique as the troll in "Cat's Eye" ** demonstrations of a sexual practice Michael Hutchence may have employed ** an example of what Emilio Estevez will soon see and act as ** soft core porn even Cinemax would pass ** manbutt and a topless scene ** a wacky (or is it ") whack "-ee?" ends involving accidental hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie (well it saw the way to me) ** and a rudimentary surprise ends apros pos of nothing much. It is as if the writer himself fell asleep on "Deathbed" before finishing the final draft. It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on hi-def video and doesn't look bad, but doesn't make it look good, the play is just good enough not to be bad enough to be fun, And that's all else. No one would probably have seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie, the modern day "double feature". I was not aware of parts of it, so I might have missed something. But for some reason I doubt it. Rating: PASS
