Oh my god, it just won't get any worse than this !!! I always love stupid, small sci-fi B movies that are so stupid, they are funny, and I thought this would be one of them, but it was just so stupid, I found it quite regrettable that it was allowed to be released. What did these people think about? They are of course not real filmmakers, and I really hope they have gone back to their daily jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do! The play and the non-special effects were nowhere near the standard for even the lowest budget B films. And what about the men dressed as women, they could not find any women who wanted to show up in this crazy thing. No, certainly not. <br /> <br /> I would give this a "0" if possible, it doesn't even deserve a "1" too horrible. Don't waste your time (and especially your money) on this horrible loser of a non-movie!
