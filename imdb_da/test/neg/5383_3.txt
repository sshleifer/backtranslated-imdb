I enjoy movies of different kinds and qualities. Whether it's your typical standard Hollywood action movie or your Oscar season tears, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be fun for me. <br /> <br /> In Soap Girl I got nothing but confusion. Firstly, we meet Maya, a massage processor who seems to attract all the customers in the living room. A virgin poet named Harry comes in one day and they fall in love. Then there are different turns and thrown into the plot that seems to lead nowhere. Although many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to bring the light to the problem. But whether it succeeds or not, it doesn't matter, because the question is whether the movie is fun or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl avoids meeting the standard I expect from movies. It was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie, given the loose plot and mediocre action. Worse, the director seems to want to make a drama when the tone falls more toward comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie like Soap Girl who doesn't catch me in the cinema's magic will always leave me bored. Throughout the film I couldn't help thinking: "What is it really about?" A movie must answer this question before it is made. If not, what you end up with is a blank press to catch the audience. <br /> <br /> Degree: D + <br /> <br />
