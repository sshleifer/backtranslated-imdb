On the opening day at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was very excited to watch movies that are historical and not common. The guest's speaker, who opened this movie, created a sense of hype against the turmoil and how this film is underestimated. The sci-fi part of the movie was very interesting and amazing for its time, but I'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after Brilliant 1928 "The Wind" or if it seemed that Russian filmmakers are taking after which Russian novels are famous for (hundreds of characters, clumps of plots), but I know for sure that the dramatic parts, as in the parts of the Earth, were completely meaningless, boring, and I was lost in about twenty minutes . Perhaps it was acting, but I was convinced why this movie is "unknown and undervalued": It is boring, there is no plot or basic story, and the play is terrible. This is certainly not a "battleship potemkin", but I would say that Russian films do not make a very good effort in light of what life in Russia is like.
