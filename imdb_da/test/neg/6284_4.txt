There were only two reasons why I could see this movie. First of all, Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were in it (which are both good actors) and I had nothing better to do. As I watched the movie, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This movie is a complete waste of time. It's a standard ex-cop flick. Ex-copper is the best that ever was, but he was fired. He continues to do things on his own for reluctance to his former friends, and he saves the day. All the great surprises (NOT !!!). Go to bed or if you have insomnia, try this. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
