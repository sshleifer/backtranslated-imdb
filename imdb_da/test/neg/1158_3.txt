Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictional story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a rash of cruel murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950s. His wicked mind and winding world are supposed to be due to his dominant zealous Lutheran mother. Ed was nicknamed "The Butcher of Plainfield". He would rob corpses of fresh graves of women who looked like his mother, and he would have sex with them before he dressed them as a deer in his garage. Cut heads with bodies hanging on their heads are his personal trademark. After his arrest, there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home. In this movie, a young substitute makes Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) the quest for Gein (Kane Hodder) as a personal when his storekeeper (Priscilla Barnes) is missing. The action is much better than the ridiculously liberal narrative of the documented events concerning Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
