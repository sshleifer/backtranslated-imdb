Kudos to Baxley's DP to make this a real movie, the first time in this series (with the remarkable exception to the F / X scenes). By moving closer to film production values, however, it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. They were very in "so bad they are good" category of horrible movie entertainment. Can an argument be made even though the "believers" simply tried to make a generic action movie asking for it? There are so many times in the movie where they discard their own belief system to be annoying. If all that is happening is in keeping with God's will, and they are simply his instruments than the people who are infected with the virus, it has happened as part of his plan, right? Apply it to any situation where some of the faith does not submit to God's will and you get a rather hypocritical little movie from the director of 'Action Jackson'.
