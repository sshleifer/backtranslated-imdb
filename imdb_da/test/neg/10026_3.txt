Supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels too long to 80 minutes. A year ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the mountains of a mountain burned in a forest fire. Years later, campers leave the fireplace. Of course, a bunch of horned children is on the way to this area for a leisurely camping trip there. Despite an unfortunate welcome from the Forest Ranger (Jackson Bostwick), the kids resort to the mountain in some way. Before long, the children begin to be picked up by the monster who remains unseen at the end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. There are no surprises to talk about: they are killed in the exact order as the formula for these films dictates, as the "last girl" disappears by itself, although the final girl in a refreshing downbeat denouement is imprisoned and impregnated by the monster . The story itself couldn't keep the weight of function length so that it was padded with seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, apparently being shot at another movie and inserted here as a means to make the movie long enough for a video release. On the plus side, wildlife footage is pretty nice. Also among the highlights is Bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death order, OK Gore, and Great Jackie Coogan in his final movie role as the bumbling local sheriff. This is far from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. This is only for slasher completists.
