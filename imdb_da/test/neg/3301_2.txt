I have lived in Istanbul for 24 years and I (39 years of experience will suggest) know what Istanbul has been going through all these years. Faith Akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falls into the big mistake of being ORIENTALIST when he looks at Turkey (like his other movie Gegen Die Wand did) This movie looks seriously in modern urban Turkish life and disturbs the audience when giving (totally false) traces of the geographical and cultural spread of Istanbul. Anyone who could Turkish could easily certify that many underground bands and groups depicted in the movie (Siyasiyabend for one) are so MISERABLE and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as' representatives of modern Turkish music. Much less a piece of shit, which many Turkish listeners do not even know at all. <br /> <br /> We Turks have long been accustomed to "superficial" Westerners who look at Turkey with some Orientalist views: trying to fit the true Turkish image in their minds. What's new in this movie is the fact that now a Turkish original director (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: Looking at Turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to portray it as if he understands better. All for a vain effort. Just ask any Turkish friend of yours: What kind of musical documentary is this without mentioning the names: Zeki Wall, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? .. and many others who have managed so far the right music we listen to today? <br /> <br /> Believing Akin has a long lesson to learn before we chatter away and confuse others' minds with false images of modern Turkish music.
