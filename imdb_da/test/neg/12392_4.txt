Grosse Pointe Blank was really a below average movie. Its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The action is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times, with many characters seemingly very 'eccentric' and it really annoyed me. The whole of Reunion and 'Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy, and many scenes just drag on, especially closer to the end when they are at the reunion company itself, and the characters go through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them. It just seemed very tacky, meaningless and was poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's role as "rival" assassin is very sparse. He only seems to be seen at the very beginning and finally in a final show down, which is hugely hyped up, but does not deliver at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. Most of the songs in this movie are straight out of the 1980s and with the exception of two or three, it is very bad. Hearing duff songs over quite a duff movie just adds the negativity around this movie. <br /> <br /> I could continue to think about how little things were annoying and were just very bad as the very few action sequences that came and went very fast, the lack of character development and how poorly everything was built into it department, the way that half of the time you forget that Cusak's character is even a hitman, as the element is so non-existent. <br /> <br /> Even how the comedy thinks it's fun; but it is not. I didn't even laugh during this movie. Sure, maybe I smiled again and again, but my only real, good point was when I realized the movie was almost over! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with 'Grosse Pointe Blank' despite the relatively high (but badly wrong) IMDb rating. I've seen movies that are better than this movie that has lower ratings on this site, telling you that there are better movies out there. Just don't bother with this one.
