A stupid show in the rest of them with horrible music and a laugh that must be from I love Lucy. I was removed by TV because of shows like this, but picked up 1st season at Lots for $ 3.00. Should buy the Van Damme movie instead. <br /> <br /> If I was a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and continuing to come up with this drive / propaganda to undermine the family values ​​I want to point to this show, married to children, family guy etc but i'm not so i dont want to. <br /> <br /> BTW I'm not a Christian, love the Simpsons and Peep show. I saw two episodes and thought that if there are exhibitions like this, they are popular, who are they popular with? Then I remembered all those photos of the people of Walmart who have been circulating around the net and thought ah ha!. It is no wonder that our culture is a joke around the world when it is the first time.
