What an interesting hodge-podge. It could have been something more, but no imagination seems to have entered the manuscript or direction. A man is framed for murder by his wife and her lover. The composers do a rather thorough job of getting him to look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas) whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "imaginative" manages to escape the prison, turn it to the conspirator's beach house and secretly record a conversation between them where they reveal their guilt. Then he accidentally loses the tape recorder with all the evidence of it in seawater, but manages to retrieve it. He shows a lot of creativity and improvisation skills to an imaginative guy if you ask me. The tape is now damaged goods, but it is enough to break down the wife's lover and he stumbles out confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> The location is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior decoration due to the Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear Peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after the production was packed. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to see because a person seems to have shot each scene through a pair of tights stretched over the camera lens. It's all very fuzzy. And for the whole natural beauty of the location, the viewer never gets a true sense of what the sand feels like of the gray barks texture on the stunted evergreens. <br /> <br /> The play is okay but the artists do not have much to work with. The best performance, as is often the case, is given by Dick Olsen as a blurred but not unsympathetic defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen exudes infidelity with every stroke of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within his reach as an immoral weakness. <br /> <br /> The musical score just melts the vicious with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original from which this was cut off, rent Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and listen to Bernard Hermann's exciting theme. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any particular reason to capture this except complete boredom.
