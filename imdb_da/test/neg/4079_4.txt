EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms (Cameo: Jon Stewart Of course ) Strained 'successor' to 'BRUCE ALMIGHTY' with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving television to begin his style as a freshman congressman has his hands full when God (Freeman represents his sacred role, Jim Carrey wisely avoided "called") requires that he builds a sheet like Noah and the hilarity follows (or should have). The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is completely paralyzed and only Carell's beloved persona surpasses his vain Evan to something resembling a human being. The end result is a lot of bird pockets and total blooms (supposedly costing $ 175M for CGI F / X). Sykes steals the show as Evan sarcastic assistant. Sacrilegiously unfunny. (Dir: Tom Shadyac)
