Kubrick may have been the greatest instructor of all time. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, his first attempt was ever bad! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had good reason to try to make this movie disappear from the map: It looks like an Ed Wood movie. It has strange narrative, cheap shots, poor dialogue, vicious music reminiscent of your 50's sci-fi / horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast "Reefer Madness" goes crazy without reason. <br /> <br /> You can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there. It is a psychological / horror study of war. The signs were dehumanized and insane. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and special facial expressions of different people. And there are a few interesting shots over there. But it's really a mess. Of course, I do not deter you from seeing it. If you get it, you join a select group of myself and a few thousand people all over the world who have access to it.
