The Jaws rip off is the craziest of all the Italian 'genres', and director Joe D'Amato is second only to the big Jess Franco in garbage production. Put the two together and what do you get? A gigantic piece of waste, of course. Unfortunately, it is not waste in the good sense of the word, since Deep Blood lives more in boredom than it does in hilarity. For the film's credit, it actually tries something that borders on a plot; But taking that credit away from the movie - the plot is nonsense. It has something to do with a group of friends taking an oath (of friendship) and then an Indian curse that manifests itself in a shark. Or at least I think that was what happened. Still, the majority of the film is padded with dull dialogue and 'drama', and the shark itself - which cannot be forgotten - is the only thing we really want to see - finds itself in just one como role. Or not even that shark is actually stocked! In spite of being a trash can genre, there are actually a lot of fun jaw rip-offs; But with this one, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he could not bother himself to try and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark movie all the time. Avoid this dross.
