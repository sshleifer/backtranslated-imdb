Do NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is quite fun. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. At times, we actually discussed whether it was so bad for that purpose, but we're pretty sure it's not. Signs appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, changing the scene in the middle of the stage to this store all the time, and Vampire Assassin ends up having about 6 climate battles with enemies before finally coming to the main vampire. You will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of Vampyr Assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts. So if you want to see a movie that makes you laugh hysterically, then I suggest this as long as you go in with an open mind. Don't expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it gets even worse than that. I seriously want to buy this movie and place it on top of my comedy movie selection. Right next to Anchorman.
