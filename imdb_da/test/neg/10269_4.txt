Typically elaborate HBO production with a first-class cast, a rich small-town atmosphere and some good narrative vignettes, characterized by above-average production values. <br /> <br /> But it's a huge 'but', the various under-spots associated with some similar, most annoying caricatures are paper-thin and go and in dull stretches for over three long hours. The often stupid story unpleasantly skips melodrama without being entertaining enough and personal drama without being deep at all. <br /> <br /> A shame because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 grubby Paul Newmans
