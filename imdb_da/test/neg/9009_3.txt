I've been trying to write a summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. But with a movie that is as bad as Night of the Blood Beast, the plot doesn't matter. An astronaut crash lands and is considered dead. His body resuscitates later, but has been found to carry embryos of some strange alien life forms. But how did they get there? And where is the stranger who implanted the strange creatures in May. John Corcoran's body? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists around the time of the blood animal in 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes? It had to be longer than that. It felt endless. Even with the MST3K comment (which was a lot of fun by the way), the movie felt much, much longer. And it's pretty much a snoozer from start to finish. I like many of these alien invasion type films from the 50s, but not this one. It failed to get hold of my interest at any level. Baby aliens were too stupid to appear to be taken seriously, titular blood animals were pathetic, and none of the signs did anything to me. In addition, the usual low-budget Roger Corman trappings are added and you have a real loser of a movie.
