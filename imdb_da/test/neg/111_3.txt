This cheap, grinned Italian flick is about a few heirs of a manor house on the Italian landscape that leads up to the house to stay, and then finds himself killed by ghosts of people killed in that house. <br /> <br /> I wasn't impressed with this. It wasn't so scary, mostly like a cheap Italian movie should be. A girl, her two cousins ​​and a cousin girlfriend, for some reason, head to this great house (I couldn't figure out why) and staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. Characters come in and out of the movie, and it's pretty boring on points, and the majority of deaths are pretty hasty. The boyfriend gets hit by a car when she flies from the house after a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get back slowly until a confusing end when the male cousins ​​are killed together in some strange way and this weird guy (I couldn't figure out who he was under the movie, or maybe I just can't remember) goes after one girl and attacks her until finally this other girl kills him. Hate to give away the end, but oh well The female cousin decides to stay at the house and look over it, and they show scenes of her life there years later. The end. You really don't need anything, and yet you probably won't find this anywhere, lucky you.
