This film is a perfect example of how to take a fascinating subject, come up with 25 minutes of content and stretch it in a six-hour drill that looks like the form a documentary can take if the Fox News decided to make one. Even the participants in this obnoxiously obstreperous movie cannot hide their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where people take a stand and work to create a better world. If only the creators had spoken to Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they could come out with something mildly intelligent instead of this cure for insomnia.
