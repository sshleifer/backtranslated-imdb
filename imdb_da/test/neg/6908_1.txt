Hi - I usually love movies. I am 19, I have seen many and do not like only one or two. One, even though the other one was finished, I had to pull my sister (who had wanted to see it) out of my arm and I burst into laughter's tears as soon as I came out because it was such a ridiculously horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Why it was terrible: - All the cows had udder, especially annoyingly they were MALE them by weeks - none of the signs were unique or engaging, except perhaps the most important Coyote Day - the idea of ​​cows looking at coyotes is just ridiculous - the 'fun' moments are repetitive and simply become a sequence to accomplish the last - the themes to work together that should have been present at the end were non-existent. Instead, people get impressions: Yes, I take everything on myself, and in this case, I was lucky that my friends decided to back me without my knowledge - all the moments that resemble the lion king (as mentioned below) were outside corniness, even for a child's movie <br /> <br /> and ... the worst of all ... IT COUNSELES THE LION KINGEN ON EVERY SINGLE Responsible grandfather killed by Coyotes (The Coyotes are essentially Hyenas, with Day, the leading Coyote that corresponds to Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, but basically Simba) wants to play around and is shocked that his father died, believes it was his fault even though in this movie that was his fault), confronting the coyotes and getting an ass jerk, then Dag tells him to leave, and on the border to leave, Odis somehow decides to go and rescue some chickens and his friends back him up ( Of course, he leaves completely without knowing that they will help him). <br /> <br /> Other things taken from the Lion King: stars move around like characters, father figures refer to stars / characters in a mysterious loving way, the obvious circular of how the father Ben found Odis and took care of him. and how finally comes Odis' love interest, and he has a similar experience. Birth at the end? Good God, what the hell ... and even the same kind of music that seems completely dressed in the end, because it is quite different from all the previous music. Honestly, it's the first movie I've ever seen where I really angry at the evil guys - I never understood what other people were saying so far. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your time watching this. Convince the children not to see it and see the Lion King again. Either that, or take them to see Ant Bully, who was creative and artistic.
