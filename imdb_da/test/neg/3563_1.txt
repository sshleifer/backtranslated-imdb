Conclusion: Very, but very, very boring, but I looked to the end and hoped for some up and down effect, but the end was worse because it was nothing. The old black-and-white game didn't help at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but that was not the case. The script, the plot, etc. were linear, had no substance, nothing started. When dealing with psychology, you deal with analysis, therefore with details, the unit context formula .... there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the tools and creativity of the filmmakers ... it's not here.
