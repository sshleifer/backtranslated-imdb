The horrible production does not qualify as a "movie". It was of course shot at videotape and very bad at it! There is a constant screaching sound to the sound (sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters say. Poorly copied music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this stuff ranks a ZERO! <br /> <br /> The reason is constructed and ridiculous. A late 20-year-old gay man trying to hide his live-in love from parents visiting? PLEASE! And the reaction the mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing her boyfrioend is more than melodramatic and rolls straight into stupid. Talk about a stereotypical display of gay life! The action is worse than a porn movie, and the direction is very poor! <br /> <br /> As far as "production" goes, there is none! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a boring video recording attempt to call itself a "movie". There is no heart and soul to give it even the smallest part of praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! BATH ACTIVATING! BAD WRITING! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "producer" is vanity, as this waste probably cost them the price of the video tape they shot at. <br /> <br /> This amethyst waste has nothing to come out on a DVD as it is misleading to the cunsomer. I can't stress how terrible this "SUGARPLUM" crap is! <br /> <br />
