I watched this DVD for sale and bought it without another thought, even though it didn't even know it was out, as this is one of my favorite books all the time. As soon as I got home, I drove to see it only to find myself totally disappointed. Although it is true that this film is something based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters change (ie, Finny seems more like a pompous jerk than anything else, while Gene seems to be something of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or completely changed (ie, Lips), many characters are missing and famous lines / thoughts are missing. The film tries to portray some feelings that the previous one lacked, but it is done in a dark way that gives a flat boring movie. It is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book a classic, and this film takes these things and completely destroys them in its rewriting.
