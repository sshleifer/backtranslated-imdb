Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent that prevents the murder of a senator, however, in the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail. Tracker by the way is bent on ending Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low-budget cheeseball action flick is of course Robocop, and while that movie had some imagination and real energy, this just has a real kickboxing champ that runs away from a robot. The movie is not as horrible as it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s, and the figures are created to be cut down by the various fire fires. Don Wilson is, as usual, terrible in the lead role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Bad)
