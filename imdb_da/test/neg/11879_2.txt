What can I say about this? Such a great Prestige production - but in the end? Waste time, wasted money. <br /> <br /> This work is a disaster historically seen. Only some examples: <br /> <br /> * Augustus is often called 'Gaius' - his first name (Pronomen). But the ancient Romans did not use this name. Correctly would be the surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. <br /> <br /> * Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But this historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was shown as a lovely young woman - but she wasn't one. Breach and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of her curse. <br /> <br /> * She was not at her father's death bed. She was never allowed to leave her banishing. And at that time she was about 50 years old! Not as young as she was shown. In the same year Augustus died, she committed suicide because Tiberius stopped giving her a pension. <br /> <br /> * Augustus was much more reluctant, so in this movie shown. But the author and director seem to believe in Augustus' own 'Res Gestae'. What's still there? Historically extremely dubious, bad acting, poorly built and equipment - 2 Pointer out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
