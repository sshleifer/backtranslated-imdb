Wow, I just witnessed one of the biggest poker tragedies, and I'm not talking about the big death year for the big students. This movie, I'm sorry to say, was horrible. Absolutely terrible. A true tragedy in film history. Well, maybe I'm a little tough, but unless you have any interest in living in the living room, don't even think of getting close to this. And those who are interested in their lives will find that most parts were trivialized and made to be big news scenes. I saw it because of Stu Ungar, but almost wanted to finish myself as he did while watching this movie 4 stars for action but unpleasant painful
