This film is proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is horrible. How could you cast an actor built as Rambo to play "Maestro"? He shows no credibility at all and shows Beethoven. Most of all, long hair doesn't look good on the head. The greatest actress lacks all the features needed for his character. The camera's shots are cheeses and conventional ones. The lights are to close the character feelings. Poor casting and cheap direction. Too bad! The only scene worth the movie is when Beeth (I hope you don't care I call him through his nickname?) Make the girl's song a joke. In any way, I hope Harris could find his way back to real movies, where he can really show off his hairless talent.
