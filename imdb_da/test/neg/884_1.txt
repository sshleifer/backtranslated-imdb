Let me get it right: <br /> <br /> "Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the console while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with the newly separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours meet her because of her solid advice on bedtime. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Move over "The Notebook", there is a new child in town. <br /> <br /> Where to start. Well, what about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can surely summarize the basics of this immortal love in the following steps: 1. Exchange polite pleasantries over a slice of lettuce. 2. Drink abundant amounts of jack daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Give glib, unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Give your life to each other via airmail. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe has "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" in his dossier. Would "stick to your genre" be too hard? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, or laugh or even hope. But the reason they can do it is that somewhere during history, we really start to care about the characters we see on the screen. To give us care, there must be time to develop these signs ... their lives, their history, why we see them now. Wolfe did not seem to "waste our time" with such trivialities and instead gave us about. 8 minutes of background information on each character before we embarked on an intense one-to-one interaction between two ACTORS, I will all love, but two characters we could break less about. <br /> <br /> For a brief moment, when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to her problems and invites him to dinner, the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two sign. But instead of being allowed to enjoy the expectation and the playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is proprietary, we are pushed instead of a love affair between two people we hardly know. <br /> <br /> Let's see it. We've all heard cheesy one liners in romantic movies. But the reason we hit something in Bogart in "Casablanca" or Nicholson in "Something Must Give" is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to heaven and pulled through the mud and back with those figures, and when they deliver the line, we are so deeply involved in their situation, we do not even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love or even as our protagonists, we are all back with a freaky sandwich and a few snickers in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes the old Hollywood director's phrase "cut to the hunt" too literally here. When each silent-liner is delivered by our cast, the viewer is amazed if director Wolfe says subliminally to the audience: "C'mon. It's a Richard Gere romance. Buy only." <br /> <br /> As a result of this amazing lack of character - or relationship - development, the movie's climax fails to pull our hearts. When Geres's character dies, I felt as if I was looking at the news of someone I didn't know to go away. Or watch a ladies' eights rowing race during the Beijing Olympics. Just. Did not know. Care. <br /> <br /> Epic. Betray.
