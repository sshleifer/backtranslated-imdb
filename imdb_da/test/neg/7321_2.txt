I watched this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teenage comedy triple header, along with Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Of course, we didn't go for quality but for air-headed entertainment and gross-out gags. Generally, we got what we came for, but Wild Roomies really stood out: To be horrible. First impression first cover: The Norwegian cover cover showed breasts covered and a bunch of apparently "crazy" roomies in the background; Bringing up pictures of drunken semi-naked teens making piles of funny things things don't do? - The "crazy" roomies on the front were not even highlighted in the picture. And the fun things you assume they want to do? - Absent as well. <br /> <br /> This movie was branded comedy, which is a bit odd as it is not even extremely fun. The relationship drama would be more precise. <br /> In short, the movie is about a young couple who inherit a swimming house in LA, and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet. These roommates eventually put both the young couple's patience and relationship with the test because they are so "wild". The problem is, they are not. And here lies the problem with this movie: The protagonist is so anal-retent and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy. You will find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies half way through the movie. Add mediocre acting, lame dialogue and boring direction, and you made yourself a movie that stays invisible. See something else.
