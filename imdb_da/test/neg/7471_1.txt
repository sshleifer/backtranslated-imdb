"Grande Ecole" is not an artificial exploration of mixed sexuality, but if you need it, a movie for an X-rated channel. Although I suppose there is nothing in this movie to indulge in a willing seer, the plot is simply an excuse for male to male and male links that lie in the convincing context of a competition between a Parisian school of future executive directors and an elementary school for those seeking higher degrees in liberal art. There is also a French cultural clash between high status and lower status French youth, plus a community conflict with native French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a woman-to-female clutch that could easily have been arranged with no more than a little twist in the plot. The action is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic film - but "Grande Ecole" is blunt, not more than pornography with artistic ambitions. I'm not offended by the meat. It's just repetitive and long boring. Where is Hays Office when you really need it?
