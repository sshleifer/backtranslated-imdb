Spoilers in front of JEEEEEEEESESESSSSSSSSSS .... I say, "Insecticides kill insects and moronides kill morons ..." "The ghost" in this movie kills morons. In fact, several of the people who are killed in this movie ask to be killed, by running into abandoned houses, searching for ghosts, etc. ... In a strictly cinematic aspect, this movie sucks really badly. The three stories turn out to be parallel and suddenly we learn that they are separated by at least a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> Also the "excitement" is so cheap they are ridiculous. Even "nightmare on Elm Street" did not fall as low as showing that someone was being attacked by their own sweater ... it's pathetic. Save your money, stay home, and you won't have an angry with the filmmakers ..
