The Patriot (nothing to do with the Mel Gibson movie of the same name) came out Steven Seagal still made the "save environment" in his movie. It is fine. But it does not matter for good action. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) of this movie finally kicked in, then I twisted (?) There comes a mile away. Seagals anti-warfare, caring for mother-nature's attitude is not very subtle. For a movie that was originally to be debuted in cinemas, it shot much like a television movie despite some fantastic shots from the country by Dean Semler, the photographer Dances with Wolves. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does as one battle scene throughout the movie and it is totally boring. As an action movie, it fails, as a drama it stinks, as an environmental message is obvious. Avoid as Ebola crossed with plague.
