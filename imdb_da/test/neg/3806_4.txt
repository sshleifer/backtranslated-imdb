Stodgy drama starring Pat O'Brien as a rinsed reporter who turns to her former boss's house to ask for money to fund her son's operation to find him dead only on the floor. When O'Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take rap in return for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted on a movie pretending to have surprises, twists, though it really doesn't. The performances are rat over the table, the film dressing up as a hard-boiled American noir, but the mix of risky accents does not work and the story is almost non-moving. And it may contain the least attractive screen saver all the time.
