Let's get tough is one of the movies that people probably regret years later that they made. Full of horrible racist Japanese talks and jokes, this East End Kids story describes how kids will join the military to defeat japs. As they are too young, they decide to clean the city out of the bad Japs. They find one, throw fruit on it (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls out a short sword to threaten them! Police say stop annoying him! He is only Chinese! He is on our side! When the children go back to apologize, the Chinese man is dead! It's part of this huge Jap and German Spy ring! The kids make sure that this is stopped at all costs! I am sure all this was fine when it was made (1942), but now, of course, you realize that this is clearly a product of that time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. Funny how East End Kids has a black child in the group, and he is also not saving. Give whiz.
