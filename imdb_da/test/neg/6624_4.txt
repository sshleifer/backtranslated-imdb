People don't agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same type of people watching a movie with a carrot top on the front surfing through a frickin office and continuing to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top Fun? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a silly movie and everyone simply assumed what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this or Kazaam or Killer Klowns from outer space and virtually any movie Pauly Shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously, and because of this they really should not be considered some of the worst movies ever made. You see them either expecting a silly movie that is fun bad, or you are like six years old and really believe Carrot Top is fun. <br /> <br /> Please people if you are aware that carrot top is retarded and you will see a serious movie and bother to write a serious review .... don't see this. Picking on this movie is like choosing a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.
