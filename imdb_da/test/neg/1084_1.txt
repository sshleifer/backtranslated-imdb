I'll say it again ... one of the worst movies ever made, and it was made by the director who made one of my most favorite movies - "Excalibur". I was the floor to see that it got over six. This movie sucks. It looked terrible. It looked like it was shot for 18 days, and Boorman must have slept when he instructed this. Arquette didn't do anything. Just plain horrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only blemish in Boorman's famous career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
