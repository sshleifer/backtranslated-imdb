I think I was prepared for all the years of hearing about it. First heard of it from Siskel and Ebert. When they said divinely ate carving, I had to look it up. Then a friend told me about it in 1991. She also said that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mother almost dumped her father over it! So when I caught Pink Flamingos at Sundance today, I was prepared. Mostly. <br /> <br /> I still couldn't be surprised at the anal close-ups and blowjob scene. That said, the only signs I sympathized with were Edie and the husband. Her crying scene early in the movie, though over noisy to normal people, actually makes me sad. Although she was probably not beautiful, she had a sweet voice. I loved her and her husband and they actually touched me. <br /> On the other hand, the action in this poverty generation was not good. And as for the script, how do John Waters come up with these things? Well, at least it is different.
