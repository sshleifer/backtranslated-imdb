What the hell is that!? It was my first reaction to this movie (actually my first reaction contained more gang). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars are space bases, this movie has no one. Star Wars is Force, this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring. Star Wars are lightsaber matches, this movie has no fight worth mentioning. Star Wars is humor, this movie is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES in it !!! Besides all this, how did Lucas get the crazy idea of ​​letting a five-year-old baby lead !? Big, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Don't look at this! 1 out of 10
