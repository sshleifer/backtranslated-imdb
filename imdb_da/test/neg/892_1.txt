I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them, but it was not fun at all. First, it can't be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play right? This sucks and it was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a House Party movie.Second, who's John John? These new characters cannot even be compared to those of the other three films. Now I know why they put it directly on video. It has horrible music, weak plot, unspecific actors and no fun jokes at all. My advice, just watch this movie at night if you can't sleep. They should have finished series after House Party 3, since the Kid'n'Play was separated by one. I hate this one is happy that my local video store does not have this movie and will never buy it or will watch it at Comedy Central either. Just because Chris Strokes has the talent to manage an up-and-coming R&B group doesn't mean he has talent that manages and produces movies, am I right or what? Finally, the female characters were all dressed up as cheap two-dollar hookers during most flick.IMX separated one year after this flick was released probably due to the bug in this movie and all but forgotten today. In simplier terms, this movie is just plain old sucks !!!!
