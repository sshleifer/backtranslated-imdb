If you have plenty of time to kill and the DVD was given to you by your friend for free, but it may still require a lot to watch this movie, which has no good script or humor for that matter. <br /> <br /> On the working front, imran is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was a little better than Imran in this movie Paresh Rawal was good at comedy was usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a university campus, where Imran is a bad boy. N Tushar is the good one, they pretend to be the opposite of their nature, and the story goes on ..... <br /> <br /> See it only if you have nothing to do and the movie runs at your room cable TV.
