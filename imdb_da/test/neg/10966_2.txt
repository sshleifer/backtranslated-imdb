The trailer for this movie promised a new twist on the Zombergenren: setting in the old west. Except that it's not the real old west, of course. It is a kind of futuristic west in a world where an apocalypse has as apocalypse known to do, kill people and subsequently transform them into zombies. It's zombie virus time again, people and you know what that means? Be bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So in this dusty and deadly world comes a hero. He is a bounty hunter, paid to take care of zombies. It is not clear who is providing the funds, but it seems that a small hut industry with zombie hunting has emerged. But as the trailer tells us, there is a problem. They run out of zombies. The only way to continue to serve is to infect new cities with the virus. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a lot of people pawing on windows to make a good zombie movie. What we actually get is a Clint Eastwood clone (actor named Clint, to cry aloud) and his "hilarious" sidekick, trying to pose zombies, leaving some still living villains to get a great reward. The whole sub-plot of infecting other cities is mentioned only in passing, over halfway through the film. Instead, there are many Western movie clichés, bad zombie make-up and some world-class bad actors. Really bad. The kind that wouldn't even make it Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain chomp on cigars, quips are thrown, people are bitten. As the film is drawn to a conclusion, the only thing worth wondering is whether it will end up with the heroic hero as the only man alive, killing the one he loves, or his cliché becoming a zombie in the final frame. (It's the first, by the way) This film is written and directed by Gerald Nott. That's all he has done, and hopefully it will be his last. At the beginning of the movie there is a caption reading "Nott Entertainment". At least they got one thing right.
