The lines in the title of this review are the first lines of this movie's theme song, a wonderful demented parody of the (in my opinion, dreadful) song "My Favorite Things" from "The Sound of Music". And this fun little detail is not the only aspect that makes "The Body Shop" drive. "Doctor Gore" (1973) is recommended to my colleagues Gore / Trash fans. The film, which was almost exclusively created by J.G. Patterson Jr., who acted as producer, writer, instructor and senior man as the eponymous Dr. Gore, is undoubtedly something unclear, but it is also undoubtedly fun, and everyone involved, probably Patterson, was especially aware that they didn't even make a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson) a famous but completely insane plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. Along with his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey) he kidnaps forward-looking beautiful young women to build a new, perfect wife out of their body parts ... "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a movie of "so bad is it sweet" But it also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness. Food science has always been one of my absolute favorite Horror topics, and in fact, it's also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous Gore Trash flicks. Obviously shot on a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" pays some tribute to the Frankenstein movies, especially James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) and resembles the look of the early Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore flicks such as. "Blood Feast" (1963) - only that this looks much cheaper and crappier. Obviously, J.G. Patterson's motive was not just to make a fun gore-flick: Being a slightly ugly, scary guy gave his fire, Dr. Brandon's role, Patterson's ability to cope with a couple of hot, button-dressed young women (who would later end up as the donor to the body in Dr. Brandon's laboratory). Most of the gore is actually pretty well made with regard to the obvious little budget. The dialog contains some very hilarious lines ("Get it, it can be the door ... and put on a cap so they can't see you is a hunchback."). In addition to the above theme song, "Doctor Gore" also features a wonderfully crazy look of a country band called 'Bill Hicks and the Rainbows' - NOT my new favorite band. For the rest of the movie I questioned whether Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who play the hunchbacked assistant, are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly the same and have two independent obesity, red-borne guys see this strangely in a movie would be a big case. Other than J.G. Patterson, most of the cast members never did other movies. This is the first movie I've seen out of the few of Patterson. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. In general, "Doctor Gore" is a movie that is certainly not for everyone. In fact, it's a total crap. But it is also entertaining and recommendable to my fellow human beings for unusual and inexpensive rental issues. Dictionaries should display a screenshot from this movie under 'Trash'.
