A nice line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot - but not original - promised me a good night in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors delivered to the standard (Juliette Lewis cozy as always; William Hurt solid but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever), but the story was too thin to keep me engaged in history, and the twist to the finals was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to him girl, so guess what? So the final after-twist ?? I don't know what to think about. Girlfriend and neighbor? Contract with the devil, or just to get her moving in? What! The film had a good idea behind it, but the idea was not worked out in detail. It could have been good, but it wasn't. For many loose ends to bind, Columbo would say.
