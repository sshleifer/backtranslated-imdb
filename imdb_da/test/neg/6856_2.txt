Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a really bad script, uninteresting dialogue and characters, and it lacks in virtually everything else as well. <br /> <br /> There are too many signs and problems that you don't care about any of them. What the film lacks is a good and clear protagonist. Instead, the film has a bit of everything, it has suffered a hero, it has little love, and it has a little villain. I wish it only had a little less Ghoulies, but for the most part they are just very annoying in this movie. Ghoulies must be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure. In this movie, everything they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. In addition, someone had the 'brilliant' idea to let Ghoulies be able to talk this time. This seems very bad and annoying. The Ghoulie dolls were definitely upgraded to this movie and they are more detailed and can do more, but at the same time, they are much more fake than those of the previous Ghoulies movies. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the goal of this movie was more comedy than horror this time. The film is like a lame '80s high-school comedy (although this film was released in 1991). It's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the whole movie. It's so incredibly annoying and simply not fun. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't go anywhere with its history, and the movie is basically just a big mess that never seems to end. The Ghoulie plot line seems to have nothing to do with the other plot lines in the movie that involve the human characters. The movie is not at all about the ghoulies who terrorize a college, with people trying to chase them and stop their rage. No big surprise that this is Brent Olson's only written movie from now on. He simply has no talent for it, and I think he has also discovered it and has gone back to college himself instead. Even compared to the previous Ghoulies films; This movie is simply horrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
