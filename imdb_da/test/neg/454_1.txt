From the weeks and weeks of promotion to this, ABC's "The One" was supposed to be "The Real World" that meets "American Idol". We had to see these singers perform, compete and see how they lived together in a house too. Drama! Excitement <br /> <br /> Where do you start with this cruelty? Let's start with the "judges" who were known as "music experts" on this program. "Experts" mean they have expertise. Andre Harrell had at least a pedigree. He was responsible for Motown Records for some time. The other two ... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who might have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He colored his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And Paula Abdul wannabe, who did something I didn't think could happen: she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula! She was then corrected and became critically critical after the first episode. The color of "criticism" offered by these three was a real joke and an insult, not only for the process of finding the best singer, but for the audience, now quite wise, has already done so many times on Fox. . <Br /> <br /> There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as bright as possible. He actually sucked what little energy was in the program, dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery in the show. <br /> <br /> The first was how did they choose the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talented talent show. OKAY. Maybe it's an exaggeration. And assigned, performing artists must be relatively close in ability, because if they were not, there would be no "competition". If only one person was "good", there would be no "excitement". So I get that they all needed to be comparable. But they should all have had * some * chops! In addition, the judges ran a "Singing Academy", so the program was also a "Fame". It was clear that these performers desperately needed these lessons. But you need some extremely talented people to teach them with a little talent to be talented. And that was definitely not what happened here. <br /> <br /> It worked by casting the show, prioritizing the "homelife" elements, as all the players were very attractive to look at, equally equally to how badly they vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so choppy and cut, you couldn't get into the stories that started to happen, so neither did the show there either. <br /> <br /> As badly thought out as all it was, "The One" had an incredible, incredible, fatal design flaw built into the results that made it quite ridiculous. The audience rang their voice for who they liked the best, like on "AI." But then, after the audience's voice was revealed, the three lower participants were forced to sing one last song. The "music experts" who were based on this performance chose a person from the three to save for the following week. And then the participants who were safe should vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two, send the remaining participant home. <br /> <br /> "Design Failure" was that the participants had the last word. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could, would you vote to keep it better songs or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first viewers of CBS '"Survivor" could answer one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost and the participants voted back "the one" who had no talent at all! In addition, the competitor who was just spared from the bottom of the "experts" was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if they let the participants vote first, at least "the experts" would save the better of two evil ones to finish. But this just confirms how unclear was this broadcast show, where unsatisfactory the whole process was seeing and how mistakenly the producers were trying it.
