Irwin Allen's first venture in all star play was an all-star disaster. The history of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions from time to time. Virginia Mayo as the blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chews nature with Napoleon, Peter Lorre has eaten on nature for weeks like Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as the road show Marilyn Monroe, these are just some of them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known to be the last movie that presented all three of Marx Brothers, although they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk, Christopher Columbus's confidante, Groucho euchre's Indians out of Manhattan Island as Peter Minuit, and most surprisingly to everyone, Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton, who discovers gravity when an apple throws him on the prayer. <br /> <br /> Keeping all of these depictions together is a story in which humanity itself is judged. A super H-bomb is being discovered and loosening will do in the world's population. It is a day of judgment a coming. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its spokesmen and detectors. Talking about the prosecution is Old Scratch, who has been bringing the worst into man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But one also has his good side and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. Colman and Price invoke their case for the judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In these three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices that the English language ever knew. When the movie is on them, as they each bring the exhibits to their cause, it is a pleasure to listen to. So when the focus is on the individual stories, you will scream in grief. <br /> <br /> What was Irwin Allen running on, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he intentionally camping with some of these decisions? If it were satire, it just doesn't come out of the ground. <br /> <br /> It was Ronald Colman's farewell and it was hardly anything I would like to think about, I can't think of any man who could have said the case to civilization better. <br /> <br /> So when you see the history of mankind, forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment, the lawyers are before the judge.
