Critics fall upon themselves within Weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, rude and dissuasive adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it is based. Minghella's skin-fisted direction of the immense gory and shrill excessive episodic odyssey is one of the many flaws in this "civil war love story". Do they bark? After Mrs Kidman and Mr. Law meets sweet with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina city and steals a kiss before it goes to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left is a two hour test on the kidneys if he wants to survive one myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soul mate. So what? Philip S. Hoffman's amateur scene, chewing in a disgusting and eerie role, moves to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo bursting miraculously on the stage of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day. Rarely does a performance scream of "look at me, I'm acting" smugness. Her clean, floating nerve wakes her loins for a few minutes until the blower is painfully thin. Published by Miramax Strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, Weinsteins, along with Dick Clark, has the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resulting crime is that the prices have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become unclear. Cold Mountain is a concept movie and an empty, bitter waste of time. Cold indeed !!!
