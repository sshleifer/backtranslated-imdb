I started to see this because I thought it was a really shitty porn. When I watched the only excitement I got from this movie, I found out what the name was so I could look it up and tear it off. I just finished it and have considered ending my life and knew someone was actually making this movie. <br /> <br /> For those people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting, my words of wisdom are for you to probably have no friends because you were in the movie. You probably want you to have the time left in your life that you wasted on making this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no way this is a serious movie. There was an old guy being stabbed and it didn't even make him. And when everyone else gets stuck, the dead fall. It was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80-year-old man who wanted to put the parts in the body. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found "hemoglobin" or whether you spelled it because it made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What really blew my mind that they decided to throw in the random scene about college girls going into the forest looking for fake skulls. <br /> <br /> If you try to watch this movie, you should fill up your bathtub and drop your hair dryer in it and be ready to jump in. This is a must see !!! .... for anyone who believes there, life cannot get worse because it will help you realize that there are people out there (decision makers in this movie) who are even more pathetic and do not go wherever in life.
