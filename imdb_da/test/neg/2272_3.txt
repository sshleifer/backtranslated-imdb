Oh my. Bad Jane must have done the old rolling-over-the-grave thing. Although there is the possibility of poor production values ​​at present (1971) and the format (a kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. Whatever you do with Austen, the dialogue must sparkle (even in this, perhaps her most serious work), and the melodrama should be strictly unlimited. Alas, not the case with this production. When you come to Anne's Frederick, Frederick, Frederick, you will either laugh or cry. Unless you just want to visually "assemble" any existing movie of Austen's work, you can skip it. If you see it, however, there is little consolation: The actresses, who play Anne's sisters each, do a wonderful job with their roles.
