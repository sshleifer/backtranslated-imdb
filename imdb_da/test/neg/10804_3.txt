Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling. The star also Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as the angel of death. The story begins with the introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn which Soultaker role in this movie. <br /> <br /> The next college, young people's age, is getting ready for a summer festival appropriately named "Summerfest". In this film, the battle of the classes is ubiquitous throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from virtually middle or subclass. The roles of the class seem to play a role in the movie for some reason, which is not entirely clear or relevant to the story. At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles about why Zach is not called to date Natalie. Soultaker also makes an appearance, with apparently his boss's angel of death. Here, the character of D'Zar points out who is to die, and who are the souls to be taken. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a conflict of character regarding Natalie and how he treats her because of someone in his past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie is off her trip to Summerfest, and Zach convinces her to drive home with them. During the trip home, Soultaker takes an active role that causes them to destroy tremendously at high speeds. The rest of the story surrounds Soultaker by gathering the souls of the dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie are trying to overcome He must return to their bodies so that they can continue to live. Class conflicts and character conflicts lie in history, but are never really leading or resolved. There is an attempt at the end to pull out some of the drama, there are many hunting and races that tend to be really boring. It is not really acceptable and it would have been good if it had been treated differently, somehow, perhaps to increase the drama but not drill the audience. The story and the play are decent. The sound track is ok and even the production values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> In his short show on the screen Robert D'Zar does a good job as the angel of death. Joe Estevez does well, but sometimes his role plays a bit flat. Vivian is beautiful and does a decent job like Natalie, although it might seem a bit in a few scenes at all. It may sound strange, but this movie could certainly have benefited from some pointless nudity. Vivian teases us a little, but it wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a pretty serious attempt to make a movie. The results, it's worth seeing. Just don't expect a perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
