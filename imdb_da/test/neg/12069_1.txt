CAMP BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono While Walking In Forest Near Abandoned Camp Blackwood - The Place Of An Unbeaten Murder Ten years earlier - four young townspeople are targeted by a masked psychopath killing their guide (Courtney Harris) and stalking them through the forest with murderous intent ... <br /> <br /> Low-time-time waster, filmed on camcorder using the Nu-View field sequentially 3-D format. There is at least a plot, but the script follows close to an established plan (with obvious nodes to, for example, "Friday the 13th", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre") without adding anything even remotely new or interesting for the formula. Director Brad Sykes - also responsible for similar 3-D bets like THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002) - cite the early works of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as important influences on his career but while these filmmakers challenged Sykes uses the commonly used video technology to emulate their biographical heroes, resulting in a home video with delusions. Apart from the 3-D format, there is nothing here to justify everyone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
