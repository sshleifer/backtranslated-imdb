"Snow Queen" is based on the well-known and very beautiful adventure of Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to save her friend Kai from Snow Queen's links. This adaptation attempts to capture this story's sense of adventure and luminous intricate images through lavish sets and production designs, but fails in a number of figures. <br /> <br /> Like many Hallmark productions, the potential of history is completely undermined by heavy manuscripts and direction. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are incredibly nice but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the snow queen looks a bit, but is otherwise miscast for the role. There is a remarkable lack of dramatic tension on this meandering three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of fill scenes that add little to the original story, especially during the opening hours, which introduce the protagonists. <br /> <br /> That said, "Snow Queen" would be almost ideal for pre-teens with a taste for imagination and some patience. It's amazing eye-candy without being scary, and the play is pitched on the kind of pantomime over-the-top level that tells the story in very, very bold text. Just read Andersen's story too.
