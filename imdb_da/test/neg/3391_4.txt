Some of the biggest and most beloved horror films have a wicked sense of humor, but when a movie comes together, it is not as original as the "classics", but just goes to it for laughs, so a lot of po-faced, you will be critics completely slag it out. This movie made me laugh loudly several times, this is testament to the way this film was addressed and it shows. The two chiefs look natural and trustworthy, and it really helps this movie. You mess with them all the way and laugh with them, everyone has friends like both of these guys. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's amazing, scary and really well shot. Inspiration (totally steals) from lots of movies, the most obvious being Duel, Jeepers Creepers and probably in reference to Jack Black's co-star Orange County. But in reality you can choose a road trip that has gone wrong film and find a reference here. But then, it doesn't try to win any Oscars just give the viewer a good dose of fear and laugh, and on that score it's a 10! Obviously, it won't be 10, I give real sensible reviews and points as opposed to 99% of the population on IMDb. There is no way that this movie can get a zero as so many lazy idiots give too many movies and just as much fun as it was, it's also not 10. It's just a good fun movie for everyone with a sense of humor and a taste for scares. You really can't get more simple than that.
