I was in Blockbuster and I saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The cover looked good, the plot was not so bad, and the tagline (You reap what you sew) made the movie look pretty good. But I was stupid that day because I did something I should never have done. I rented a "Straight To Video Independent Horror Movie" that went out with my much better rentals I went home, Dark Harvest appeared in the DVD player, and it began. I figured I wanted to see the trailer after the movie was finished (BAD IDEA) but went ahead and saw it anyway. NOW for the review. * POSSIBLE SPOILS * First, the play of the "kids" and the stage sucks when the 2 (protagonists) speak, the lighting sucks and the buildings themselves look fake! Now they go to this house where Sean Connels (I think he is the protagonist, does not care) who lived there. Suddenly once in a while, they all begin to be killed by ... (gasp) A KILLER SCARECROW !!!! AHHH !!!!! Scarecrow is, of course, the definition of low budget, and the scenes where scarecrow is computerized look so fake it is fun. It makes dinosaur sounds and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot scarecrow with a gun (it's red for god's sake and looks like it was bought at a local family dollar) and it pauses for a while and then ..... (gasp) BLOWS UP! !!!!! <br /> <br /> Save yourself some time, I tell you this movie stinks. If you have to pass an hour and a half, look at the wall because looking at the wall is A + fun in relation to this disaster. However, it is quite fun. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F If there was anything lower ** F - ** than I would give it.
