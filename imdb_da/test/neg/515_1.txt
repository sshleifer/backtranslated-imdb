This is really a horrible movie at any of the regular scales. Plot, storyline, action, effects, direction - I could go on. Suffice it to say that it is poor. However, it has some appeal. Many out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun to look for Batman references. Umm - that's it. Bad really, don't bother.
