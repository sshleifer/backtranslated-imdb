Like most of you, I see many great movies; Between them we often find voluntarily or mistakenly also the films that are so meaningless that we think about why anyone would do it. This is exactly what I can say to the dead man's bounty .... All I can do is try to "warn" some of you. If you enjoy being entertained by a movie picture because of the story, action and intensity than you might choose something else. Now it's not all bad ..... Actually, if all you want is creative movie editing and unique angles with the original music environment than you might think it is OK. As a person who appreciates movie clips, performs and is entertained by a movie, the truth is, I thought this movie was so horrible beyond words. I could easily find a place for it on my list of worst movies seen for a while. <br /> <br /> To have Val Kilmer in this is the truth that he was probably thrown as a benefit to the director; As a fan of some of Kilmer's films, I can't understand what his motive for this was. The movie seems partly western romance ......... Finally, I am sure that most of you can agree with me that it is simply a rude waste of our time. If you haven't seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it altogether.
