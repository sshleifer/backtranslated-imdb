So, Wynorski repeats the curse of Komodo another time, this time replacing the original exciting characters with a bunch of conflicting environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the film was used to listen to the self-righteous characters spoken of the evil capitalist pigs while stuck between this cavalcade of abandonment, flashbacks to what happened on the island before they arrived. DNA experiments were performed, critters began to grow, people talked to each other without coming out as morally superior jerks, etc. It would, of course, have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks movie and forgot the sanctimonious do-gooders. Let me forget that there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier than you pose is picked out one by one, but they probably include less than 2% of the film. The most important event that pits our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as seeing the examples of the latest Dino-Crisis video game. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty bad overall, even for this kind of movie. Half of the actors seem to be more concerned with pronouncing every syllable of each word than talking their dialogue in any kind of credible way. I actually did it through to the end, but it's one of the movies I wish I would have recorded and then watched later because there are lots of parts to be relayed quickly. Overall, I give this bet a star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B movie fun to watch. It's a sad day when you can say with sincerity that the filmmakers in this movie could have learned something or two from watching Boa vs Python.
