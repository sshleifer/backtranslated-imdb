Paranoid Park is about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death, even if accidentally by a security guard. As the film continues, Alex deals with small issues such as his parents' divorce and his boyfriend Jennifer's sexual warmth (played by Taylor Momsen, which you can currently see in Gossip Girl) while being consumed by guilt. I had seen only one movie by Gus Van Sant so far, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his manicures while doing this. Once again, he crosses timelines. Once again, he uses weird movie techniques like the endless shot of people who go ... maybe you like these movie techniques, I don't know. The reason feels unsatisfactory for me ... it's almost too easy to be explored for so long. The feeling I get (same with Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an "artistic" film that causes the film to lose substance. Also, Gabe Nevins was pretty bad as Alex, there is a difference between looking foreign or loosening and resembling a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant then look at this, or skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
