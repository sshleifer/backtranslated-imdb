This movie was incredibly bad ... It's gory, but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, there is nothing left to the imagination. And the plot ... what plot? There really isn't any! Pacing is incredibly slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the manuscript must have been written by a horrified 12-year-old child killing kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of gore (boring and tired) but because it was a horrible movie. It should have been BANNED from existence. Avoid this as bothered. 1 out of 10
