Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at Half Way House at the right time to take a break from the track and discover a lot of dead bodies inside, among them a man he should deliver a message to - Ed Rogers, the proprietor of the company. He is observed by Sally's sister Sally (Alberta Vaughn) behind a hidden room where she remained unnoticed under the carnage. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a film technique here as in other of his films, where he quickly trades from one place to another, which usually involves a rider on a horse. It is pretty well done and seems quite innovative in these 1930s era Lone Star Westerns. <br /> <br /> Pre-Gabby George Hayes is present, sans whiskers, and this is the first time I've seen him as a villain. In fact, it took a couple of scenes to realize that it was him in a dual role, first as a hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute" who communicates via pencil and paper, only to transform into Marvin Black, leader of a gang of crimes. Black's gang was responsible for the murders of Half Way House, trying to force Sally to sell out to Matt / Marvin. Another stapler is also here, Yakima Canutt as a black male called Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne otter, "Neath the Arizona Skies". There is a lot of time-consuming riding back and forth between the Blacks Gang and Sheriff's pose, as John Wayne's character maneuvers to reveal the evil ones. In the end, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars at the cost of destroying Half Way House, where he switches some dynamics pins into a safe. Greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is an appropriate end for the villain. In his best "Aw Shucks" setting, John Wayne falls under the beautiful Sally Rogers, and unfortunately Randy is no longer alone!
