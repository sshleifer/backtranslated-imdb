What is this about? Kelly (Jennifer) seems to lose all moral behavior as soon as she comes to the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) existing and exotic, though she knew when he hit his ex in the face, which he also justifies later in the movie, right or wrong? These two guys are the first to find each other on the island. Kelly is completely lost in every sense and the great Juan P can fish and build a house. Sir. Handyman. They seem to have a good time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, Kelly's character man) and of course two days without knowing what his wife has done with this beautiful Juan P, he is a bit jealous. Billy Z is the stereotypical rich guy and maybe not the best man in the world. He doesn't like Juan P (to hit his boyfriend at the quay, who can blame him? Hes is also arrogant, but he paid lots of money to rent the boat and Juan P, who is the waiter / everything he can't get either A beer white for 20 min. Wouldn't you be sorry? Billy is probably the guy you want to hit the face if you meet him, but at the same time he is not guilty of suspicious scuba goggles Manuel has Kelly and Billy just lost some dear friends, how convenient he is with them, no matter what! But for some strange reason, Kelly likes this girl who hits Manuel and begins to hate Billy for being jealous. Okay, Billy's overreacting, that's for sure, but Kelly doesn't do much to convince him either. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them as he has been so good (and although Manuel shouted at her and calls her things to ask him some intimate questions. But Kelly is so forgiving .. .). Yeah right. And then she starts having sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a relationship within this eye spectrum, at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talking like people do when they like each other . Now you can think that this scenario is possible. But for real is it? Are you cheating with your husband after two days on a coconut just because he is jealous and seems like a drunk at the bar? (I wouldn't disagree if the relationship was really bad, but the director doesn't give much advice if that is the case). For Christ's sake, Juan P has not really proved to be a good person. Catching some fish and building a wooden house to get into some panties is showing a good side? Don't try to be friends with Kelly's husband anyway (which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the time, just being respectful). He doesn't care about their relationship (and Kelly can't figure it out), he just wants to have sex with Kelly. Kelly's character is just not credible (if she was stranded with Billy and another attractive girl, she wouldn't be sorry or what?). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person, and Juan P is actually not much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused and believes having sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive of bad Juan P? So ... for all of you reading this ... What do you think about it? If you were the Kelly character, you would consider cheating on your husband when you knew one day, you will be back in real life, and suddenly Billy's may not be the terrible person. Hes just for jealousy. And if you where Billy's character, what do you say, is he completely wrong in his behavior? And Juan P's character what you really believe in him. One thing is certain. Manuels exist! Ps ... Voodoo stuff is so wrong here! What was it about? Seriously! Someone tells me?
