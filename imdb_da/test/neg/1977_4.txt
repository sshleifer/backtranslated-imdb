I give this movie a 4 reason why I am a die hard fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and it is great to see the whole band in CG form Sephiroth is still cool <br /> <br /> now the reasons why it only got a 4-well, the characters feel like wooden planks with some of it worst voice play I've ever seen (I've seen epic movies) <br /> <br /> The movie just seems shyly oriented so much that it even makes the fans embarrassed by the cloud and the cloud. the clouds mentioned so much that it doesn't mean you want to see him in this movie <br /> <br /> The bad guys have the price for the worst villains ever (I was more afraid of the evil witch in the west) <br /> < br /> All the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie to nod to the fans and no longer take it as it <br /> <br /> is with the cold chally ??? <br /> Summary: Waited 9 years for this movie, and that's what I get a big pointless and boring cut scene, I ask the head of the square cenix to shoot the man responsible for this, burning every copy of the movie and any one involved in it and creating a new movie from the ashes (it would be nice to make the movie live and based on the original game)
