I have to be honest and admit that this movie essentially didn't do anything for me except baffle me completely. It is burdened with a plot about the mysterious murders of several young women who then relate to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) begins to have his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I've never really figured it out.) Jones was ok in his role, even though I thought He really started to show his age here. Scary disgust was John Goodman as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, which I suppose should be some sort of local mob figure. I simply didn't think Goodman was working in this role, even though I admit it might just be because I'm not much of a John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix, Justina Machado seemed like an FBI agent, although I never really understood what the FBI was involved in, which could just mean that my attention was walking away from the screen. If it was explained, I completely missed it. Fortunately, this is a pretty short movie so you won't waste too much of your life on it. 2.10
