Great story and great leading actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film is suffering from bad directing, bad acting and bad script. Leading actors do their part but could not save the movie at all. Wrong because this could have been a good 80s style Hitchcock excitement / mystery / thriller.Ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.An ok look for big Ryan fans .....
