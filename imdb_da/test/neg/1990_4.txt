I am surprised that the "hospital" has been so well received by the critics and the public. I found it boring, visually ugly and generally meaningless. After the first almost impenetrable 40 minutes, the film improves (relatively), but it remains far too far away (not to mention unfunny) to be successful as a satire and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. The movie's uncertain tone is its biggest mistake, and even overshadows Scott's amazing (as usual) performance.
