Uh, bad, bad, bad, but I've seen worse why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Just finished watching this movie and I thought it was so messy like the meat on Dr. Chopper's face. The worst line in the movie should be "I like to introduce you to someone ... meet my inner b * tch", which consisted of the only survivor of the amazing 5 group who threw a trash can on Dr. Chopper and then fell on stage. Second worst line, "I'm a park ranger who will fuck you up" What is this freak not even a cop ????? Did anyone else know how everyone instantly dies of the magic bowel sting (no one dies so quickly from a bowel sting, I know this cause because I often see them in the operating room) except the super park ranger. Dude had, like a bucket of blood, poor out of it wound, writhes around on the floor some, and then comes in to the final to say goodbye to Dr. Chopper while inner b * tch is lying on the floor. And if it doesn't strike everyone, he doesn't even have a decency to die like everyone else. Inner b * tch helps him stay outside and continues to tell him he does not die while she is running for help because he is like her only friend who is alive now. Since when were these two friends? I don't think a hectic meeting in the woods, where he tells you to look for the city, qualifies to get to know you time, but whatever. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if there is nothing else and you have nothing to do with your time.
