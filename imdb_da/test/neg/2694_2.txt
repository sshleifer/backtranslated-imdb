I watched this movie as a snap preview before Venice's opening at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to it will greatly depend on your attitude to respecting Shakespeare's text. On the plus side: Pacino gives a very good performance, actually like Shylock; Lynn Collins is a fine Portia; and the film has a lavish appearance. <br /> <br /> The negatives are predictable. "The Merchant of Venice" is undoubtedly the most difficult of all Shakespeare's plays to stage today, largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of the 20th century history. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem. Shylock's character does so because we lack the original frame of reference for the Belgian audience. Shylock is also a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the old law's relentless quality. When he says, "Don't you have a Jew?" he is a character; when he proclaims "I want my bond!" he is an abstraction. The long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut into ties) is the key to the game, restoring universal harmony after the disturbing and evil (Shylock of the test scene) forces are pushed out. It is possible to make the mental sense of Shylock's character by showing that he is gradually becoming angry and becomes a monomaniac at the time the trial scene rolls around - the key is that at some point he must cease to be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance almost does, but not quite. The movie cannot be completely seen - on the one hand there is the right movement in Shylock's character, and on the other hand, there are a lot of additional recordings of Jews being abused and Venetian whores with sucked nipples (no doubt showing decadence by Antonio et al). Shakespeare did not write an Ibsen-like social drama; he wrote a comedy following the classic pattern of disturbance of social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love toward law in the middle of the Shylock plot. <br /> <br /> In this sense, the movie is a travesty - Radford's surgery on the play and direction forces us almost away from it, it really means. (At the start of the final scene, cut most of it and move it before the sample stage is the most extreme example.) There are some other significant difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a fine actor, plays Antonio as if he were overdosed with sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is beautiful but low as Bassanio. Most of the players, with the exception of Collins, Pacino, and the actor who plays the Duke in the experiment, mumble their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Finally judgment? A beautiful movie with a few decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's bad interpretation. Not really worth your time or money - even though Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it.
