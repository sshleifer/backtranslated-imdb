UP ON THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: You can find some SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what's in the UP AT VILLA, A beautiful but low piece, one of those made with the sole purpose of earning Oscar nominations for the best costume design and art-set direction (one for movies and another for score is also welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of pieces produced each year: a beautiful, intelligent woman who tries to find love in a strange place for her. She has many difficulties, but ultimately finds her happiness in a man's arms, which is not the one she had success with. In this case, our lady in Florence is some time before World War II. She is an English widow engaged with a rich-but-old man (who of course she doesn't love). One day she meets another man who does not have a good reputation, but for whom she falls in love. Of course, there is her friend who helps her better or worse and a third man - who commits suicide here in the lady's room and poses a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP ON THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I was always quite interested in the story, but was never tense. The problem is not the slow pacing, but the manuscript. Adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and tensions. Every time you think the story gets hot, it gets cooler again. If you think there is a conspiracy involving the average police chief in Florence, then there is, but it doesn't change almost everything in history. It just goes on going and going until the predictable end. As I said, UP AT VILLA is not bad. If it is a bit boring, it never gets juicy and too sentimental. The action is half and half, but surely convinces. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad choices after the ENGLISH PATIENT (the saaaaaaappy romantic drama HORSEWISPERER and the boring / annoying RANDOM HEARTS). UP ON VILLA is undoubtedly better than the pieces, and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, although his character is a great guy. Anne Bancroft is a great actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And here she does not leave her character ridiculous. Now, the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is soooooooooo annoying!). The management is good, but not horrible. It was interesting to know that the director is the same of ANGELS AND INSECTS (also with Kristin Scott Thomas), another so dramatic drama, but more bold than this. What matters here is the pictures. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are amazing, the landscape, the music ... In the end, UP AT VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. It's tough and interesting, but don't expect a thrill movie - it's not! This movie kind of fails because it wants some mystery, something to see ... But there's not much to say mainly because of the low picture. Now, about the Oscar nominations, don't worry - it will probably get them.
