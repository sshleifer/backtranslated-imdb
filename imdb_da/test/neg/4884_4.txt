Very interesting to find another reviewer who had the same reaction to this movie as I did: It was a lot much better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Seeing it more than 30 years later, it's still okay, but it kept my interest only mildly. What seemed very funny then was only mildly fun. Also, things that were amazing to me as a 10-year-old came over as just stupid. For example, Trinity goes into a scene and burns his revolver behind and kills two men without seeing himself. In fact, he doesn't even disturb to see and see if they're dead because he knows he hit the mark. Um, yes, right. <br /> <br /> In addition, much of the dialogue sounds quite wood. Sorry, but 35 years later it doesn't really age so well. Although it has been a long time since I also saw one, it would probably be a better Terrence Hill movie than this being my name is none.
