Honestly, in connection with the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love party for the killer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The implementation of Wanda Jean, with the one-sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. It tried to claim that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported this view. She seemed uneducated, but the whole family did, but that didn't mean they were all retarded. I can fully understand if anyone is opposed to the death penalty, but to completely ignore the crime, as if it did not happen and try to put Wanda on some moral mountaintops, is offensive in nature and that is not the side of the problem I would be associated with.
