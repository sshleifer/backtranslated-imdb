I understand this was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was pits. The whole movie is pronounced as the sound roll was unwanted. Voice overs were so poor and awful quality. As much as I love Troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over the work. The action was horrible. One thing I enjoy from this movie was Trey Parker's quick como that made the aristocrats joke with a greasy wig. There are many great instructors duded in this movie like James Gunn and Eli Roth (friends of Lloyd Kaufman). Again, I think this was Llyod's attempt to save a crappy movie and try not to lose thousands of dollars. I don't want to continue, but this movie was a mess. Check out other Troma titles.
