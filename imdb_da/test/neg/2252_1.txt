I have deliberately not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I saw it because I really wanted to see it and make my own mind. I have previously been a big fan of QT, I think we can all agree that he has made some great movies, but in the end he seems to have been overcome by his own mystery and disappeared his own foundation. This "movie" proves it. It consists of few scenes by Basterds at work. Instead, it consists mainly of long, tedious, boring conversations between people, who after a while realize that you just don't care about. It is longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogues that QT has been responsible for earlier. The whole movie is anticlimatic. There are no tensions - what happens in each scene is telegraphed so clearly already that the moment it happens, you just don't care. Honestly people, do not think hype. This is a very boring movie and you won't miss anything if you don't see it.
