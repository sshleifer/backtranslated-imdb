I had seen this movie just days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it around lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu so I decided to see it. Seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tv ... you know, after Conan but before infomercials sorta deal. Although this movie has very little to do with webs, it has a lot to do with spiders, see my headline if you need a refreshment. <br /> <br /> I found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating. A hidden atomic generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... Would have been a great start to a cool fantasy, but then it goes downhill after 15-20 minutes. The cast is poor without memorable performances, poor quality queen who has had her breasts reinforced ... considering spiders do not wear breasts. And bad sound effects. An obvious low budget film, even though the cast has tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians stumble across a hidden atomic generator while at work. They snails with the buttons and opens a portal. 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes ... scrambling to find out what is happening, seek the party in our world help while the other party observes their surroundings. <br /> <br /> Help doesn't come as they open the portal and follow through the meeting in a parallel dimension. They encounter a race of human spiders called soldiers. After a death and hunting, they are rescued by survivors. Now it gets boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal and then attack the hive. After losing 2 more electricians, they open the portal and escape to our world ... about 200 million years ago. Sounds interesting, huh?
