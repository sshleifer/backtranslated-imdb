One of the latest (disaster) movies from York Entertainment, "El Chupacabra" excels by getting its viewer to die after wasting two hours watching it. This movie seems to have been filmed with an extra video camera usually used for birthday party. The only reason I could tell that it was not because of certain scenes where the camera man's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of the cinema is plagued by this movie, and I'm sure it has set the film industry back for another ten years. The actors are border retarded, often pausing while waiting for the off-screen cue card to change. The actor, who plays Navarro, does not just blast and jump words into his dialogue, but stumble through the Swiss cheese plot line with a crooked and confused look on his face. Other actors break the forefront and generally show the working ability of a twelve-year-old child doing a science project in his backyard. My friends and I are targeting the worst possible movies, and one of us gave us more than we negotiated. The humorous parts are unfunny and the rest are riddled with horrible cliches and plot holes. As a friend so humbly puts it, this movie is the interrupted fetus in the industry. I would highly recommend this movie to people like me who intentionally search for these movies, but for everyone else, beware!
