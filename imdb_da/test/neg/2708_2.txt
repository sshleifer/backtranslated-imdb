An ear-splitting film, a quasi-old-fashioned screwdriver, designed to showcase the comic attributes of the song star Madonna. In fact, she goes a long way on the proverbial limb where she plays a surviving parolee trying to prove she is framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car as she ran red light ... big grin) . After an energetically animated credit sequence - which is much more fun than the rest of the picture - we have nothing to look at, but Madonna's black mascara and red lips turn off with her platinum hair and pale skin. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems to be beaten and playing Maddy's goalkeeper while the poor electoral support struggles to be laughed at with a miserable dialogue. It is an unfortunate decline to the talents of director James Foley, which inappropriately allows his star to run violently in the spirit of the nutty slapstick movies of the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side) . Miserable. * from ****
