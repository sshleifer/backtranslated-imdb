First of all, I have to say that I am generally not a big fan of werewolf films in general. It's not that I don't like them, just because I don't like them very much. There are some I have enjoyed ... Werewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), an American werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some I thought were okay, but nothing special ... Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but in general, the werewolf subgenre is not my favorite. But I had it here on one of the 50 movie sets, so I thought I'd give it a watch and see how it was. Spoiler's Following ... <br /> <br /> Mad Monster is a werewolf story, but Werewolf is primarily used as a carriage by a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron has discovered a way to turn people into animals, especially wolves, but was ridiculed and excluded by the larger scientific community. Out of a prestigious position, he becomes sour and picks revenge on those who mock him in an old country mansion where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the lovely Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) with limited mental abilities. Using his serum, Dr. Cameron Petro to a werewolf and sends him out to kill his old rivals. Eventually, Werewolf Petro is out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed. <br /> <br /> The movie also plays something like a murder / criminal drama with Lenora's journalist (Johnny Downs) examining the doctors' strange behavior and rash of murder. The story seems to borrow many elements from other great images that came before it. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of a monster running amok, and the creature kills an innocent child. Visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, Victor Fleming version) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) also come to mind. And that is one of the problems with this movie in my opinion - it comes across as a mediocre message about some amazing movies. It doesn't add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> True, there are some redeeming qualities. George Zucco's performance was convincing and the scene showing Dr. Lorenzo, who spoke to his visions / hallucinations of his plagues, works well for me when he shows his madness. There are some reasonable character structures, at least in his character. But Glenn Strange's character is not at all convincing and seems to have this comical quality, whether intentional or not, I am not sure it just does not fit into the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I liked it more than most IMDb users based on my 4/10 rating, but it was still a below average movie. Perhaps worth seeing if you are a fan of early wolf movies or a big fan of the 1930s and 1940's horror movies, but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not.
