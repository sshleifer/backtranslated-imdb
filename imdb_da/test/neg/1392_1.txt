What is it now that minority comedians feel okay to forge their minority and expect to get away with it? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is no George Lopez. There is a difference. When I see comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to muster his show as "Hispanic / Latin / Spanish" version of the Dave Chappelle show. What a terrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please do not make a "Block Party" movie. As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and reunion of the cast "Xica da Silva" on a steps, not.) <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as Dave Chappelle liked to use the "n" word. Nor is it fun or acceptable, even if it is from 'their own people'. Carols Mencia also likes to say, "If you are offended, too bad". It is not the offense, it is the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted. Carols Mencia goes on - he respects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. It's not comedy, it's not fun. There is a finesse to be able to look at yourself and make others laugh at comedy and not laugh at enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mind of Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what is fun and not what will put more prejudices going and then - do it. Until then, the Mind of Mencia show is a pass.
