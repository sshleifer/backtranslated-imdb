... BREAKER MORANT and ROOMS STOMPS. It has also given us watchable movies like BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately for anyone involved in this debacle, WOG BOY will not appear on any of the list. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see this movie simply because of the politically wrong title, so politically incorrect, that when it was broadcast on BBC 2 late at night, the announcer hadn't even mentioned the movie's name, so I was expecting something so aggressive anachronistic that my jaw should fall into disbelief. It fell into disbelief, I didn't find myself able to believe the financiers thought this was going to be a big international hit <br /> <br /> The problem lies with the cast and script. I know that Australia with its small population does not have a large group of actors, so I will forgive most of the time, but that does not stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy to work, you must be impressed by the leading actor's comedic skills, and I'm sorry to say, but Nick G just doesn't have the skills. I had never heard of him and seen nothing else he has been in, so maybe he is much better at other performances. Here he is just annoying, unconvincing, and I lost count on the number of times he hit the camera. The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable, and coming back to the manuscript, it seems much less developed, I believe, who believed that an ongoing gag about a female Minster of Work that has it in the back of a limousine, was fun to begin with? You get the feeling that a person in the production should have been more honest and said "Look buddy, this manuscript is not so good enough. Go and make it more subtle and structured" <br /> <br /> I've been hard and hardness is required in this review. I gave the movie four out of ten, and it would only have three if it wasn't for the one really fun sequence where Steve sees a current affair, only showing himself flashing on the screen and tagging a "Dole Bloodger" . This shows that the screenwriters were aware of comics and social comments. Such a pity that they did not come up with a much better written film
