My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies and have and have read almost all the books I can find related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say that this movie is a stinker. Save your money and don't save your time. If you like mindless action, mindless gore, no plot to talk about and like to be taken by Hollywood, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a serious Alien series fan, send a message to the overcrowded, over-paid Hollywood & 20th Century Fox suits & don't give them a dime. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many plot holes in it that you could see pasta through it. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, it has all been said exactly so I don't have to repeat them. The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And the film doesn't disappoint, almost everyone dies. Even the blonde soft hot blonde. Are you sorry for her? Nix. No plot, no sign development .... who cares. The predators are now also idiots. They scan anything but their own dead warrior. They suppose to be a high-tech society, right? In the Predator movie, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy kills. In AvP, they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had cancer. Great plot hole! Also R rating is because they have children in the movie, who get a face chopping, lots of gore and violence and there is a hospital scene where a very large pregnant woman is injected with breast brushes. She is implanted by Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love scene-orgy and they all flap in, say 30 seconds. Sensational make a lot, nothing more. These scenes are ridiculous, not serious. It's almost like the violence is happening, and Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, thumbs or neck knots. <br /> <br /> Aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancers. They evolve rapidly and spread quickly across the city, tons of them, anywhere in record time. Pathetic because it does not hold on to the series history and adds nothing to Aliens, Aliens Predator continuity. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that the positive reviews are written by people who love doing. Ridiculous. As a movie, as a continuation of the alien's franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this movie is at best a cheesecake clich√©. If you have followed this series faithfully, all rules are broken, and aliens and predators are reduced to cartoon characters. There is not a fantastic, memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no brand name actors. The reason is as thin as onion paper, which eventually ends with a, "We have two choices to get out of this mess ... the hospital or the center of the city!". I'm just wet myself. The city center means everyone is going to be nuked by Big Brother who somehow knows the city has been attacked because they have an AWAC in the air that can see the attack on a radar screen in special effects Red Spots. I almost fell out of my chair. Special effects red spot the alien radar on an AWAC over Central America. I'm splitting my bowel. <br /> <br /> Getting to the helicopter pillow made me strangle my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? You have to get your game pieces to the helicopter pad to win. I have almost wet myself laughing. <br /> <br /> The end is enough to make you shake your head in wonder. Who took 20th Century Fox to write this script! OH, OH, ask me .... a Grade 5 student. There really can be no other answer. Oh yes it might be another answer ... Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi. The end? "Col. Stevens takes the Predator impulse to Mrs Yutani (Francoise Yip). She tells him that the ground is not ready for the technology it represents. Col. Stevens knows that Yutani doesn't want the technology to use on the ground." You shit me, don't you? Ms Yutani? Who's Ms Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She's in the movie exactly 2 seconds, yet she says in her infinite Far East wisdom that the world is not ready for technology. Seriously??!! The Brothers Dweebs (Strause) as Directors? Who is responsible for this bleeding loss of a movie? They are Doug and Bob McKenzie of board members and yet Fox has entrusted the flailing Alien franchise to them. They are adorned as experts with special effects, yet the movie is all low budget special effects. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Laughable. <br /> <br /> This movie is made only to empty your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no plot. It has no main characters worth mentioning. It is uneven. It does not comply with any of the principles set out in previous films. It does nothing to promote the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. And it has no end to talk about. It's low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Either watch it on TV, where it will quickly end. Buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding wound completely. There is a reason why Fox does not preview this movie to the critics. The critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have been at the theaters to watch it. JR Giger, the original creator, is right now and leans over a toilet wasting his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie is a stinker. It's so bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Play now ...
