Dead Man's Bounty (the movie's American title) has the look of a classic Italian western. The camera, costumes and sets look great. Cast is robust, not a beautiful face among them. In the beginning, I was preparing for a pretty cool movie, but what I finally experienced was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> Scripture was horrible. There was no excitement at all and very little action or valuable drama. <br /> <br /> Despite being good, the cast (English) asked with heavy European accents, which were often incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The final nail in its coffin was the broad dash of pretentiousness that paints most of the image, focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid highlighted in a couple of very awkward sex scenes. Also, her speech at the end was pretty contradictory! The only news comes from the cast of Val Kilmer in the role of the dead man, and continues his latest series of DOA performances!
