Slow, odd films that draw and plod (I mean really PLODS) along with its disappointing climax. You can expect some kind of punchline at the end, but there are none. Both Milland and Snodgress provide awkward performances; In fact, the film's amusement can actually be the only thing it has for it. The generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a really horrible fantasy scene with .... a gorilla. (**)
