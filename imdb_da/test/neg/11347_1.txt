The first season of Bones player in Finland, and I can't believe the amount of villain that this show puts on - the characters are low, badly directed and clumsy. <br /> <br /> It's a bad man's CSI. Or actually, CSI without a coherent plot. Although Knogler has the potential, it fails because of a lack of director who has not been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It's actually sad to see a show throw it all away as it could have been a descent show with just a pinch more thought. From the start you get the feeling of how awkward the actor is. <br /> <br /> Long story short - don't play your time on bones.
