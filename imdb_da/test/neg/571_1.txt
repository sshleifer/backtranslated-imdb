** Possible Spoilers ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, 'The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque coastal town of New England, where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint little bookstore. One day at work, Helen is crossing an anonymous letter (the title "love letter") somehow filed under the pads of the leather bag. After reading the amorous prose in it, she believes it has been written to her, deliberately placed on the couch for her to find, and for her own reason believes she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Unfortunately, Helen leaves the letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, thinks to be for her, and of course she thinks who wrote it. Circumstances then bring it to a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who believes Helen has written the letter to him. And before everything is sorted, one can only imagine the hilarious situations in which all those involved have been cast; And I think to imagine because the way this movie plays out gets the audience a little more than it does themselves. There are two specific areas where this romantic comedy fails: It's simply not very romantic, and it's not fun; And it's a strong combination that makes this movie fail almost from the opening credits. Once the setting and the main character (Helen) has been established, it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so. At that time, you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and to whom you could fit less. Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It is a shame to see such a talent wasted on such a claptrap as this and look bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually lights up the screen just showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to have just come out of a three-day legder that lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually gets away and sees the best of the pile. It is said that the journey is often a more sensible experience than the destination. However, in the case of 'The Love Letter' it would have been best for everyone worried if everyone was just home in the first place. I rate this 1/10.
