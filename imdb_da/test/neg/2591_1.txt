I'm usually quite tolerant of movies, and very easily entertained, but this movie was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> After watching the cover, William Zabka was in it (The Karate Kid bad boy) and under this movie I could see that this would be the only reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is a huge waste of the actor's talent. The music and sound are terribly sticky - I couldn't believe it in a movie made in the 90s! <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really recommend this movie unless you're interested in one of the actors.
