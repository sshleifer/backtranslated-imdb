I think Walter Pidgeon was badly mistaken in this movie. Just not trustworthy in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and acted well enough. No one else was memorable at all. <br /> <br /> I remember the TV shows being spun from this movie when I was a young child. I even think I had a plastic "Seaview" that would immerse and was great for playing in the bathtub. Long time ago. <br /> <br /> As for some of the other criticisms I have read for this movie: It is certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge in 4 decades ago by today's standards. The effects were OK for 1961. Not great, but OK. As for science, it was ridiculous even for 1961. There is no excuse. The bottom was also terribly spacious. I understand that the fleet refused any help whatsoever to this movie, so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie bored me. (And I'm a sci-fi fan.) Can't recommend this one. Degree: D-
