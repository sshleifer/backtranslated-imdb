I am a music lover and was excited to watch this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I was ready to go out halfway through the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which meant I did not care about what happened to them and completely lost interest in history. On the good side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so it made a part of the movie bearable. Also, the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the whole movie, but it couldn't keep me through to the end. The actors did what they could with what they were supposed to work with, but the manuscript was just not enough to make it extremely interesting. Bite about "washing me" was completely rubbish. I wonder how many actors had to do on one (I wouldn't be able to say these lines without jumping into laughter.) Still, it might be so shame that it was so much better.
