I am an American resident of the United States. Why India continues as a stupid animal, to imitate everything, American is beyond me !! The biggest problem with the movie is not so much the inane plot and the stupid comedy. It is that this movie has a lot of sex, touches, women dressing as strumpets on the streets, and a lot of curse that doesn't belong anywhere on television. <br /> <br /> To the producers and directors of this movie I have this message: You continue to weaken our nation's strong family values ​​by doing this kind of junk. You keep letting young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. You continue to make dance songs that belong to the lowest of adult clubs and bars. I'm ashamed to be an Indian after watching movies here. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the US government proposed that the best way to destroy Iran is to send mini-dresses there. It is not necessary to do so for India. We will destroy ourselves with waste.
