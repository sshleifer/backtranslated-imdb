Native Chief's son is illegally accused of his father's death. The wicked witch doctor orders to execute him. He comes back as a murderous tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a "movie"? If it were supposed to be a horror movie, there was apparently some kind of bad judgment involved. And for a comedy it's still not fun enough. I don't know why people make movies like this. I think you should be in a really stupid mood to see it. Or maybe you'll see the incredible "monstrous" tree that gives a new dimension to "a slow death". Or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills of everyone involved. (Ms. Kilgore!) Or the dialogue and manuscript that was strangely ignored at the Academy Awards that year. <br /> <br /> "Shouldn't we try psychoanalysis on that tree? Maybe the mother was afraid of oak trees." 2.10
