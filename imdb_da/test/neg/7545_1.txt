The unthinkable has happened. Having first seen it a few years ago, I have had a movie that has been my benchmark for horror and that the movie was called "McCinsey's Island". A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I don't make this up), it throws to new depths of film making and is still the only movie I've seen that made me know how the movie's budget could have been spent on . Like new schools or cancer treatment drugs. But for pure and unadulterated levels of crap, any movie will have to lower their standards even lower if they want to drum up "Guest House Paradiso" for the distinction of being one of the worst movies I've ever had to watch . <br /> <br /> Based loosely on the harsh but entertaining TV show "Bottom", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers who can be imagined. Richard (Rich Mayall) is the hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine, and so angry lecherous as to almost slime the slime from any action. His friend Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to drive Britain's worst hotel located on a cliff next to a nuclear power plant. Between them, they pamper themselves with cartoon-like violence (with sound effects) on a regular basis, stealing something externally valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there, staring slowly at any woman at all. The plot, as it is, involves the arrival of the fabulous Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) fleeing her wedding and trying to lie down at Guest House Paradiso, much to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And that was that. <br /> <br /> I used to think that the Carry On movies represented everything bad about the British film industry, and God knows we have spent so much time and money trying to escape that godly heritage. We've had movies like "Trainspotting", "28 days later", "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg) but this ... this pulls the movies screaming and kicking back to The days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor at the top fly with the help of a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it offends you the moment you see it. I kept an eye on waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start, but they never came. Just an endless stream of scarcely gags, imaginative scenarios that explain explanation, some entertaining violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing as much as a slap. Get the first ad break (it was on TV you watch) and I was ready to shut down, but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "I look at this so they don't have to" became my mantra so you remember how much you owe me for this because it was just as fun to have sand that kicked in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I used to love the "Bottom" TV show. The combination of appropriate grubbing effects from Mayall and Edmondson with OTT juvenile humor worked ... for half an hour every week. Certainly not for an hour and a half, as Edmondson and Mayall pamper themselves in their little private joke and live and depress the rest of the audience. Generally, this makes Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" as "The Godfather" and should you be able to meet one of these two people (who is largely solely responsible for the chaos on the screen pretending to be a movie), You are welcome to quickly deliver a boot to their testicular area. They will probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both guests of the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship, but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The film is similar to Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
