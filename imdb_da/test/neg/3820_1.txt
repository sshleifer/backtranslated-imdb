This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. History has potential that is never realized. The actors are a bad choice, but given the screen writing their talent is not wasted. I really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so I could come out and see something else. Unfortunately, I kept to the end and had a laugh at the murmur of people moaning over how crazy this is. There was no booing, despite all this being England, just mildly arguing how bad it was. Then I look at IMDb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10. I really can't see how these people can give it score. They must be a public relations firm working with the distributor. There is a hilarious problem at the end of the movie, when in the cemetery and the hick attacks look like the dodgy landscape that cuts when touched (supposed to be a brick) - the blood effects are waaaay OTT - the film feels like everyone does a spoof war except the director.
