What can I say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay theme movies ever to come out of Britain. I can only imagine that Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed the money. What a story is, such a striking mess that you lose interest rather quickly. It must be based on real life events. Well, all I can say to one is that it is an insult to the signs of real life. The DVD is currently in the UK. It is available in the split format, which should make it even worse that the full screen version I see. Gay cinema can be so much better than this, and we deserve more.
