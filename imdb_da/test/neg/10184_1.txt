Film about U.F.O. is always a good way to kill sometime, so on a rainy Sunday night I picked up this flick and expects what can be expected from a direct-to-DVD U.F.O. mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong! At about halfway through the film, it becomes very clear that U.F.O. theme is just a misleading way to attract unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a Christan movie from an average Christian. No, it is Christianity in the extremist fundamentalist kind. The scary kind. <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, the non-believing lead is being cheated by their colleagues through a practical joke about believing that the rapture has begun (which Christians believe will end in the end by the time true believers come to heaven and non-believers are left behind). When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer 'only if we Christians are right'. Now it's a lamest excuse to become a Christian if you ask me! <br /> <br /> This movie is still trying to convert non-believers using scary tactics. "Believe in God, or you will go to hell!" is the message here. Simple but rather offensive, really. Especially because this movie is sold as something completely different. Now, suppose you are a Christian fundamentalist yourself and you are not likely to be offended by the themes of this movie, is this a good movie? I'm not afraid of it. No, I actually lie: I'm glad it's not! The action is horrible, the pacing is horrible, the plot is terrible, especially the end is ridiculously bad. As soon as the movie starts, you immediately notice that this will be worse than you expected and you are right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, at least it seems like trying to create an acceptable UFO mystery, but then suddenly they come into this Count Dracula look-like, which begins to stumble upon the devil. At first, you just think this guy is just a crazy galaxy, but as it turns out, he actually represents the real views of the filmmakers decision makers. As soon as you begin to realize this, you know how this will end. But actually it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
