The topic was good, the direction was ok. Mohanlal was effective in his role as major. The spectators' actions were, at best, amateurish. The director and director should be held accountable for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was horrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his bad histrionics. He didn't look at that part, nor did he move like a soldier. There was a scene requiring a satellite feed of skirmish with the militants, and they showed it from a camera angle. The satellite is located hundreds of miles in the sky, so the only angle is from above. It was quite embarrassing moment. The audience these days is matured and they recognize when trying to pull wool over their eyes. The director is a major, so the story can be out of his personal experiences. No problem there, but the movie is only as good as its actors and director. So if Major Ravi goes on other projects, he must pay more attention to the casting.
