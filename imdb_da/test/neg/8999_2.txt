What a waste of time. I got about five minutes into it and became * very * antsy, and jumped fast forward, and soon the desire to take my thumb from the forward button was not present. Actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did very good job, I thought, but no one else saw me, gave something like a good performance. Again, this review takes with a large grain of salt because the film was just as unbearable that I couldn't make it to the end. Heck, I couldn't make it to MIDDLE !! <br /> <br /> I can't find this review because it's not long enough. Perhaps this last sentence puts it over the top.
