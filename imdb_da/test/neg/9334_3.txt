This film and several other films from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately show all pagans or anyone who is not a Jew or Christian morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, there is nothing good from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. Any film that preaches about the "true god" gives a short shift to religious freedom. The films ignore the fact that ancient Judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fruitful ground for religious extremism. Most of the 1950s religious films also overlook the loss of freedom that arose after Christians had adopted political power in the 4th century.
