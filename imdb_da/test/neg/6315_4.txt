This movie is based on the Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero) series! It's placed in a different setting than Streetfighter's animated movie! This movie is about Ryu, which is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! There were no other characters used from video games (which I could detect)! The battle situation was OK, but nothing really spectacular! And there weren't many of them! For me it is strange! Is not Streetfighter fighting! Streetfighter's animated film (1994) is much better than this movie. It is trying to be more than it really is! The use of "Hada Power" and other supernatural abilities has nothing to do with the skills the characters have in the video game! And in this case it's a bad thing! The story is so boring that you don't really worry about what happens! The action is toned down considerably! Why? And what happened to the other characters from the video game! Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game is the characters with their own special skills! In this movie it's about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
