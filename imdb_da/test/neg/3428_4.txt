The story of goodbye to the king is exciting. An American "deserter" (I had the impression that he and his 3 companions were only trying to escape the catch in the Philippines, as their desperate escape with fleet to Borneo is not your classic desertion). But not before they come ashore when they are discovered by the Japanese. Nolte character (a sergeant) has only moments previously gone down the beach alone and was not noticed. And, unbelievably, no one noticed his footsteps in the sand that would have led him to Japanese law. But nevertheless, Nolte is consumed by a tribal tribe and becomes their king after defeating another tribal gentleman. So he's out of the war. Then, discover British commands and want the tribe to help them fight Japanese. Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant hamming destroys an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier pushed back into the war, now with a war-tribe under his command, Nolte seems to be raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language, rarely through contraction. He makes sweeping movements when he speaks and seems like he is one with nature as if he were raised in the jungle. There are lots of action and many interesting scenes with the British who interact with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte's character is never credible. It always looks like he's overdoing. He had to be a little more of an American soldier and much less of a tribesman. As it is, he comes across, not like a royal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. But that is not the intent of the movie, since the manuscript has been admired and trusted by the British commands. There is never any suggestion that the British believed his behavior was strange. He is simply regarded by the British as the defacto leader of the tribe. Thus, it always seems that Nolte character does not fit in with what should happen in the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another actor has done a good job of performing, delivering his lines credibly and making it an excellent movie. But Nolte destroys the movie by hammering on every scene and does not seem to understand what his character should be. What a waste.
