This show is what happened to Screen Savers after the G4 got its hands on it, taking a useful source of computer-related information for a show that had the highest point of pushing a thumbnail web server into a person's rear. /> <br /> As G4's ratings dropped, they moved away from their original target audience, players, to generic hormone-driven young men who added eye skin to the staff and a gender segment. Now the players who initially applauded the show turned away in disgust. I look forward to the show, and the network, overwhelmingly delayed and well-deserved death.
