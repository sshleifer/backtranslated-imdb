My veiled childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult series of Belphégor in the French 60s ... so I was eager to see the big screen customization. I should have kept my money and gone for a walk in the Louvre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the scenario is still very apt and interesting (Le Louvre's phantom), but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues permanently hesitate between French irony and serious "American business" without achieving, but not without, hanging on asinin. <br /> <br /> Shopping magazines somehow to be desired, and special effects are poor compared to what you might expect (low budget?). <br /> <br /> What's left of all that. Not much outside a few good shots from Paris ... which is rarely a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Belphégor was worth more than that. <br /> <br />
