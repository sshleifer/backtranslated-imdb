Yes, in this movie you are treated with several small carpenters on the attack in apparently a very hot climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. It is actually a much worse movie than the original which at least with one whole production looked like it cost more than a few bucks and a video camera to make. It has its fun moments, but it's really weak movie to do if you ask that the picture is cheap and that is your intention. You can't make a good story, your effects get really bad, let's just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible a liners and we have our movies. The first one had at least a somewhat credible story as the snow in one attack in the winter and not what it is like a resort. It also had better effects, one is only a step or two in front of "Hobgoblins" as far as the monsters are concerned, and you will really be more than a step a two over a bunch of puppets. Nevertheless, this is for all this with a super ending that depicts a large marine vessel taken out of the mighty frost. In fact, I'm just fun, but it was really the funniest part of the movie.
