I would avert any temptation to watch this movie, it is simply boring. The characters are predictable and thoughtless. The murder is quite infinite. There is no excitement, fun, no style or even a glimpse of originality found in this train wreck. And the morass of Hollywood clich√©s is choking. Oh, and you have a movie that makes a hero of an IRA terrorist. Cute. And now I have to talk a little more to fill the ten lines. And a little more is that enough? Not quite what about now? No, it should be better to confuse it, but The Jackal is really not worth ten exhibitions. However, the original was great.
