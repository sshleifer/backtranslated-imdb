I'd rather have someone cut my eyes with a razor blade than to watch this movie again. I saw it from start to finish and thought it couldn't get worse .... BUT THIS. The authors and producers should be hit to put this kind of shed on TV. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood, you fool and go to work at McDonalds sweeping the floors and emptying the waste. Anyone who thinks this movie is even external decent should hang. They are an embarrassment to humanity. To believe we have soldiers who put their lives in line for anyone who produces this kind of inane waste. Make me embarrassed to say I'm American.
