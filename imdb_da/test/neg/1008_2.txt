This film may well have been a propaganda film for the North American Falunist Party - or a similar group ... The strong man (Kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and releases rebellious citizens by killing worthless waste. The only thing that made me think it was not made by KKK was that a Jew star like a good guy. Try to see it again as you think of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right-wing group - and you want me to see what I mean ... It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually made music for this movie ... :(
