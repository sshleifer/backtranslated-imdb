I hired this movie from my local movie store, and didn't expect anything to flash or fancy. Since it was a "B" grade movie, made on a very tight budget. The movie's opening scenes were pretty original and it was also plotted and that was what made me use the movie. However, the movie becomes very boring and frustrating on points. The story had lots of gaps in it and the actor also had a fair share of disappointments. At the end of the movie, I prayed that a higher force would knock me down where I lay as I was very sad, but more importantly frustrated with how the story appeared. I still don't understand what actually happened and I'm not very concerned. In conclusion, the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a crazy film.
