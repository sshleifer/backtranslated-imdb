This film had an excellent premise and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes towards women at work and male female relations in England at the beginning of the last century. But it simply became a rubbish love story. But what was worse is that the love story was incredible. The action was mostly poor, the direction confusing, but most of all the manuscript and history were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the movie was how dark it might have been before electric lighting. I really have a feeling how little light a light puts out.
