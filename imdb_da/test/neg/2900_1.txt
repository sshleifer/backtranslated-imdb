I watched this movie a few years ago and man I will never golf again. I think ninjas seem to have no respect for the golf game or the way it has evolved. And I'm not talking about "sacrifice-free" things like forging a scorecard. No no. Based on what I've seen here, the shameless massacres hit both policemen and golfers on sacred land clubs. Judge Smailes would spin in his grave. And did they repent for those sins? No no, based on what I've seen here, is the typical response of a beaten ninja to take over the body of a panty female phone repairman and seek revenge. I find this morally reprehensible, and of course, having seen this nonsense not only stopped golfing and talking on the phone, but also decided to stop giving birth to the homeless.
