This movie was filmed in my hometown, and I was familiar with many of the "actors" in smaller rolls. Most of them were students at the local karate school, and even when it was filmed, we all knew what a stink was. However, it was interesting to see it was made. Most of the places where it was filmed no longer exist, such as Nightclub, pizza trade, etc. The "World Prize" was held at the Akron Civic Theater, and we all laughed hysterically at how obscene it was. Personally, I think it's the worst movie ever made, but it brings back many good memories. Watch this movie with a word of advice ... enjoy it for what it is .. a very low budget, badly made, karate flick.
