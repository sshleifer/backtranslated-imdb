Well done, yes. Very good, I have to say, even though I don't speak Chezck. Beautiful filmography. But the manuscript is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera, where you know exactly what should happen. OK, maybe the end is not so predictable, but is it good? It's one of those movies you've got the feeling that has already seen and forget the next day. <br /> <br /> I just got a note from IMDb saying my comment was not long enough. It's really sorry, because I have no idea what to say about this movie, which actually says a lot about it, don't you think? The case is .. It has no soul and no originality. Compare this movie with Barrio, or Riff Raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot The Child). It's sad to see that this is a much worse movie.
