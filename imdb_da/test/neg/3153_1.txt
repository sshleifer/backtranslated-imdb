Barney is just awful. As many of the other reviews on this show say. I'm not disagreeing with them (I don't want to). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use children that look like they are in sixth grade, cheesy plot, horrid dialogue and really crappy special effects. Not to mention the big purple dinosaur himself. He makes every other children's show look like prize winners (Sesame Street has won awards that I know of). <br /> <br /> Please see Sesame Street, Thomas Tank Engine or even Teletubbies. Avoid both this and its film (which I also reviewed). They are both extremely crappy and are inappropriate for anyone (even small babies).
