Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares in cinematic infamy in his famous 300-film, low-budget career. While few (if any) would call him good, his movie's unclear connections to underground culture (through reference, tribute or influence) have secured him a spoiled legacy of its kind. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of reusing his own films ("Piranha", "Humanoider from the Deep", "The Black Scorpion", etc.) without improving them at least. "Raptor", "written" and "directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite cinematic culprits, "Chopping Mall") takes the practice of a disturbing news low with regard to Corman's center in the 90s "Carnosaur" trilogy. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's credits are in quotes because "Raptor" is not a tribute to the "Carnosaur" films, and not even a remake. "Raptor" is the "Carnosaur" film, or at least the movie's dinosaur-induced death scenes, randomly split with trace elements in the original plot and some newly recorded scenes (many of which consist of "dino's eye view" shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious). The "new" material was written around in the footage, rather than vice versa and is completely unwieldy, with great logical shortcomings (eg two separate teams are sent by the military simply so recordings from parts 2 and 3 where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included) which is great considering how little logic plays in any of the "Carnosaur" movies already. The actors' lack of sense in their characters (although in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the manuscript once, perhaps twice), remembers the dreadful tree that appears in the 1950s b-movies, and certainly does not matter between the ripped Off-scene scenes worth watching. Even more embarrassing for the actors in the new scenes is when there is a clear disagreement in the physical structure between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene evokes a response in a movie, the oldest trick in the horror book, the "spring loaded animal" is something seriously wrong. <br /> <br /> As it stands, it is a despicable exercise in two b-grade numbers (which doesn't have to worry about ruining their reputation because they don't have one) ripping off their own material for the Cheapest and fastest of dirty tricks simply because they can (why else would someone have the tear off a series intended to be a rip off of the "Jurassic Park" series?). There is not much more to say than this film carries my highest recommendations against viewing; The only good thing about it (besides staring at Melissa Braselle's belly button) is that I don't have to see any of the "Carnosaur" movies.
