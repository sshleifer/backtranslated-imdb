Another silly "movie". The quality of the image is correct. Sound too. Music is in the middle. The guy is trying to make music like in Halloween. <br /> <br /> For a rare time, producer / instructor chooses non-anorexic girls. That's why this "movie" takes a week to make and costs $ 10,000. Does that mean when the producer has money, do they choose all anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not good actresses. Neither the guys either. But maybe it's just because the story of this "movie" has no value. I'm sure we give $ 10,000 to some teenagers who like movies and they can create a better movie. <Br /> <br /> Don't miss your time to see this "thing".
