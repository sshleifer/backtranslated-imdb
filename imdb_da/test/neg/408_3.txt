Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Obviously something has happened to Ron Howard. I do not know exactly, but something has gone very wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent work director. While never going to be confused with an artistic savant, both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films, the Parenthood was quite good and even the Angels and Demons prequel / sequel. The Da Vinci Code was a fun ass. In addition, none of his films has been quite scary. (Note, I also haven't seen how The Grinch Stole Christmas or his latest movie Heidi Montag says no to Plastic.) What more Howard managed to keep this quality is such shaping genres as star-fired Oscar bait (A Beautiful Mind), star-driven costume drama (Far and Away), star-controlled revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). Angels and Demons are in the center a poorly directed and shot movie. Scenes are too dark, camera angles are wrong, actors block each other's shot and the whole affair is often out of focus. This makes the story of an already confusing story even more confused. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is picked a lot, but I found The Da Vinci Code a fun readable drum (so sue me). The movie production of the Da Vinci code became the same, where they come to the next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive spot shooting. However, Angels and Demons are taking place in the claustrophobic framework of the Vatican City and since Howard was not allowed to film in many of the right places, we end up with a lot of running around a CGI back party. The whole movie is as if Rick Steves made a Vatican City special and instead of visiting the holy city and pointing to his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a used art book with all the breasts deleted. <br /> <br When the Da Vinci Code had what I still believe is an exciting central mystery (again suing me), demons and angel history consist of a plot of the Illuminati (scrolling eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in the schools for the deaf around the world and to repeat each student in the series repeatedly. Unfortunately, the Vatican does not need any help on it. <br /> <br /> Yet, their plan is to infiltrate Europe's great Hadron Collider, kill the main priest and steal three vials of anti-material. This asks more than a few questions. Can Hadron Collider Create Anti-Matter? Can you catch the anti-case when it is created? Why does the EU collect it? (Maybe they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why does the head of Anti-Matter gather a Vatican priest? Now when they get anti-matter, will they use their incredible devastating power to take over the world? no just kidding Unfortunately, the Illuminati has not yet fully understood the Pinky and Brain levels of sophistication yet. Instead, the present pope is just dead and it is conclave time. The top seeded cardinals of the last four poker tournaments are all kidnapped, and the Illuminati kills them one by seven. They are good sports however leave traces of any murder like some Latin theme knight. Oh, and the last kidnapped cardinal has anti-matter, and if he's not found in time, Rick Steves must go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only some Latin themes Batman to save the day ??? Okay the story is really awful, and that's badly said, but maybe it's one of the movies that is hidden from good performances. A true character study ?? (Okay you know where it goes). Tom Hanks gives an incredible wood performance and looks just awful (he's too old to play the character for about twenty years.) His love interest Israeli actor Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant / cabana boy as an Irish man who seems to be breaking into a musical number at any time without anyone stealing his Lucky Charms. On the plus side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd puts a good trip as the leader of the Vatican's security and as far as we know, there were no deaf children who were raped during the production of this film, which puts it in front of its Vatican critics in at least one area.
