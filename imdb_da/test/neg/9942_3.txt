This is one of many American attempts to reuse an old classic British TV show that is more famous than this. From what I see none of you have not mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a TV 50 '60 called "Secret Agent Man". The original Secret Agent Man played the great Patrick McGoohan (Prisoner, Braveheart, Ice Station Zebra, Phantom, etc.) A man who was tapped to be the first James Bond, but he knocked it down because McGoohan was a very devoted man and he considered James Bond's bed hopping and violent ways to oppose his values. <br /> This show was made in black and white, and it is a shame for those who have not seen what you are missing out on. The grade Mr. McGoohan played in "Secret Agent Man" was called Drake, and after completing that show, he continued to make it very popular, but sometimes bizarre and controversial TV series called "The Fanger". The character he played in "The Fanger" was that an agent whose identity was not disclosed was kidnapped and transported to an island where he did not know where he was or who it was responsible for kidnapping him. What he knows is that his prisoners will know the reasons for his resignation from the British secret service, and on this island the population does not have names but they are referred to by numbers and Patrick's character is assigned a number that is "6" was alleged that his prison character was actually the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself contested it. <br /> <br /> Ofourse is the unmistakably famous theme song that the original Secret Agent Man exclaimed. It was written by Johnny Rivers a famous 50s and 60s pop musician and from what I read some of you actually think the song comes from this version of the show. You're very wrong. It was Johnny and it comes from the original television series, so let me help put the facts straight. For those who complained about the name of the show was stupid, good in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the US it resumed "Secret Agent Man". For such a stupidly stupid name, the show did well enough when it was first broadcast. <br /> <br /> Granted this current show has little to do with the original, not such a protagonist named Drake in this one, and I guess they did their best to get this to show their version of "Secret Agent Man ". But it uses the redone version of the original theme song so it tells you that this show was actually supposed to be a redone, albeit inferior redone version of the original series.
