Seeing this movie, just ask: What did they think? There are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie, you can get the feeling that it is deliberately bad, like a kind of joke. I think the worst part about the movie is the director. There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other movie elements in this movie that are ridiculously bad. The funniest example of this would be at the start, where the party guests receive their invitations via e-mail - The same camera angle is used for each shot (which lasts an unfortunate 2 seconds a piece) and the same computer screen with the same desk / window / program etc. . see you. It even seems that things are shot on the same set every time. The whole sequence was also completely quiet, with no music or sound effects. All in all, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an email was sent all over the city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, note that the music sounds very similar to other movie soundtracks. It's not surprising - most songs, including the one opening the movie, are actually small changes in the scores of other movies (see if you can guess which ones). I also noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds like it has been written and played through a low than midi keyboard. If you are familiar with LucasArts SCUM adventure games, timbre sounds for each instrument as something from the IMUSE engine. Everything else about the movie is simply sucking. The action is horrible. Scripture is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the movie remotely fun unless you see the whole movie as a big joke played on a paying audience. Don't rent this. Don't even see it when it's the subject of the comedy center. Just forget it - it's terrible.
