As a child of the 80s as so many of the other reviewers here I hated the original V and V: Final Battle. I own both VHS and never connect the video to watch them. I can't remember much about this short-lived series much, but I couldn't remember why, so I rented the first disk. By the third episode, I had my memory updated. It's terrible. Scripture is horrible. It's not even fun. They had a lot of material to work with here, but it seemed like they just didn't know what to do so they turned it into 'Days of our life with four-legged aliens'. How cold and full of potential is the concept of the Elizabeth Star Child? All they would like to do is grow her into a whiny, boring teenager to compete with her mother romantic? Marc Singer looked less embarrassed to be in Beastmaster II than he did when he was caught in this drift .... point is whether you are one of the younger folk who have just discovered V or one of Us older sci-fi fans look to rediscover some old fun, save yourself and SHIP IT!
