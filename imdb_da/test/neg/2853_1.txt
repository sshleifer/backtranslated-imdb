I sincerely asked why this movie was ever made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production in a version of Berlin, where all Germans speak English with a German accent, and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the play is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject, but in Germany I know that there are no gangs that shoot each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer who walks around killing Turkish children and painting them white. To create excitement, we see the serial killer and hear him hum Schubert's cradle, but we cannot see his face. <br /> <br /> I don't even think they actually shot it in Germany. There are some street pictures that are clearly in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in these shots. It is probably Bulgaria with some German characters added here and there.
