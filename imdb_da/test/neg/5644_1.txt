The guards as a concept are an interesting idea, but I'm afraid to be mistaken, Vinnie, if he gets the tough man role, his element is as in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this movie, Vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer (greyhounds to be precise), which during the film is easily popped up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man 10-15 years old his senior. I'm sorry Vinnie is hard looking hard and has it throwing him like this is foolish. Trying to investigate the double killings of a friend and addict found near the Thames. He takes on the role of policeman, while the real police are bit players entering Charles Dickens' flashbacks. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is on the screen, his reputation is in front of him, he looks hard but does not in this part need to act hard, hurry on the camera in parts. If you see the Mean Machine, he is perfectly cast and trustworthy and makes a very decent performance. <br /> <br /> Getting back to the movie, which confuses something, is the flashback of Charles Dickens, who tells another story of characters that are also shown in the present. These two stories appear to be unrelated, except for the same actors. <br /> <br /> The sound of the movie, especially from Julie Cox, is sometimes inaudible, and it's not really much what her role in the movie is short of Vinnies Love interest, she starts the movie as a Detecive, but quickly become boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute is a kind of answer but still / not answered. Strip out Charles Dickens stuff and you can have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, slowly getting to the British Steven Segal, stick to the supporting actor role, you're pretty good at it.
