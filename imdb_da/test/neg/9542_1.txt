Wow - this movie was really bad! You're talking about formal, typical movie grounds? Seeing this movie was like pressing my head repeatedly against a wall. The transitions were provided to be cool but failed. The reason twist in the end, when we find out who the bad guy is, was unexpected, but does not make sense before his monologue. Even then ... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. Are all these pictures necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of pieces of the movie. Would PD really send a lone officer to an unlit store, subway tunnel or anywhere to find a body when the location of the perp is unknown? And why is the romance at the end just a kind of suddenly happened? It's like the author tried to fit into every Hollywood clique he could. Don't waste your time watching this piece ... anything.
