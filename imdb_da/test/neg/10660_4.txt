I don't like Himesh Reshamiya. I don't like his song too. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among ordinary people. Now that he was waiting to become an actor ?? it was a great joke! What maturation does he have to harvest as much as possible in his prime time. I would never see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becomes a super-duper here! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor raked the box office collection of 14 crores ?? compared to Apne, which has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit through Apne and Rajnikant's absurd Sivaji ?? I should also give this film an attempt to understand what things this movie has got that made it so big hit? The story is about the real life singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who has gone to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now, Himesh is arrested for a murder. Himeshem's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after he runs away from prison is to prove himself innocent and find the real killer. Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He tries hard but doesn't fail. He's pathetic. I wondered what could have made the movie's clicks so much? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the movie's saving grace scripture to the point Himesh runs away from prison. (Then the movie mouse dives into unbearable stupid boundaries) Secondly, the songs in the movie are good, spectacular, crowd puller numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? she looks beautiful and also works well as the other lady. I can imagine Mallika watching the movie just for her. Fourth, is the movie movie of merry ?? especially the German sites, is a treat to look at the eye. Fifth, the great part of history is a love story between Himesh and Riya ?? with clich√© dialogues that are likely to connect with the young crowd. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha has done a decent job of covering Himesh's pathetic ability, as much as possible with images that do not need Himesh much to do. The heroine of Hansika Motwani looks like a small budget movie heroine. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. Overall, the film is below average. <br /> <br /> I thought the whole movie ?? What if the same movie script was made with Salmaan as the lead leader. I think it would have been a much better deal. Maybe I would have given the movie 6 out of 10. But now ?? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
