A rather transparent attempt to wring money out of the thriving British club scene, Sorted is a film showing promise in certain departments, but doing very little else. A perfunctory thriller plot (which is there only to stricter the club's sequences together), variable-acting and a rather ridiculous script, stops all Sorted from being the show that Director Jovy of course intended. Although Jovy is sometimes overcharged (especially when using the often poor dance music), he shows potential, and the lack of an anti-drug message is hugely refreshing. Overall, however, the movie is a wasted opportunity, and the prospect of a great clubbing movie stays out somewhere. However, it can be seen.
