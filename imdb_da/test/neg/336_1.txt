I am proud to be able to sit through everything. I think "if I paid the rent, I would at least see it". I have found the exception to this rule - The Planet. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but read through the other comments, I can only guess that Â£ 8,000 should be about $ 150. I date myself, but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves films from the 50s. He was a bodybuilder turned actress. He was in these really horrible Italian duplicate films that played Reeves as Hercules or another muscular bundle entirely. As a child who looked at them, you could not quite formulate why these movies stunk-you just knew they were doing it. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That is it. It really was this - a new story about an old Italian "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals" movie. And I don't ask you where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it is fun to watch - it's just pretty bad.
