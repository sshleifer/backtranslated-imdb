I can't really think of the creative ideas involved in these movies, but seriously. There is no coherent part of the game in this movie. It seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. This slaughterhouse is almost entertaining because you know you are going to hide behind the lack of skill and money control (not yours) that allows you to do so. Play a game or hire someone, and please make a real movie or stand in the boxing ring and have your ass handed over to you whom you do not claim will not happen. <br /> <br /> wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. had to add blah to bend you, sorry
