"The son of the mask" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we'd seen "Because of Winn-Dixie" instead. I have to say it's partly my fault when I went in to see it with him. Being the fan of the first "Mask" movie (Jim Carrey was funny) I was hoping it wasn't as bad as all the critics said it was. Ten minutes in the movie I knew it was going to disaster. True and meaningless attempts to be fun, young children aged seven and eight screamed with laughter, but the rest of us were left to stare at the screen in disbelief. <br /> <br /> Finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as I It was surprising to myself that I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two films that many people I know found raw and offensive. But the case is, "The son of the mask" is not fun unless you are under the age of 10. The movie contains lots of CGI in it, but it can't save this piece of waste. Anyone who allowed this movie to turn it into the big screen probably thought it had potential considering the success of its original. Unfortunately, it doesn't have any of the laughs, fun or excitement of the first one that creates a spot on the original movie. I recommend renting the original "Mask" to anyone thinking of seeing this. 1 star out of 10 is generous for this horrible mess.
