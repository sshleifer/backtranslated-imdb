11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be something, it's not. A young girl has an imaginary legend. One day while out in the field playing with his friends, a few refugees visit their parents and knock them off without apparent reason. The young girl runs off and hides from the bad men. Years later, the girl grows up in a woman with problems. Losing at her school (looks like suppressed gay people) flaunt their crew in front of her as she rejected one of them. The girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. A secret from her past returns to visit her. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What is her problem with her relatives? To find out, you'll have to see Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title makes absolutely no sense at all. I don't know why people get money to make such bad movies. This movie is not even good enough to make it fun. It is a headache inducing mess that confuses anyone trying to make sense of it. Not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
