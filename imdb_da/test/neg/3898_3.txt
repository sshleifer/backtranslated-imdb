I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his trash film, but almost every time I see one of them, I just see missing opportunities and plots that don't play well. Unfortunately, this film is no different. The film certainly had great potential as Franco has melted the exciting theme of the classic movie 'The Dangerous Game' with his usual brand of trashy sleaze, but the plot here is lost too often and it takes forever for Franco to get around to the film's main point. Since this is a later Franco movie, you can be forgiven for thinking that the director would have gotten better, but in fact I have found that the opposite is true; since this and the horrible 'Killer Barbys' are two of his worst movies. The plot focuses on a stripper and her spinning girlfriend. The couple are invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. But they soon find that they have not been invited for social reasons as they are "released" on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them for sport! <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this movie was the front cover and the fact that it was led by the king of sleaze flicks. You would then think that I would be happy that the movie contains an abundance of sex scenes and generally sleaze; but I'm not. The reason for this is mostly that the sexy and sleaze in the movie is really boring, and most of it only served to give me the condition known as 'itching forward finger'. But my propensity to see everything through to the end made sure I had to lump it. There was a time when I didn't think the girl on the girl could be boring, but I've since turned out to be wrong. The only positive thing I can pick the movie really is that the soundtrack is pretty catchy and despite being stupid foreign pop music; actually blends well with sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; as it was when the plot finally went, but it was too late, and unfortunately it is a serious missing film. In general, I only recommend this movie to those who feel like they should watch all 180+ Franco movies ... everyone else should instead see Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy.
