This movie plays as a demented episode of VH1's "Where Are They Now" or "Behind The Music". In the first half of the film (depicting his "glory days"), Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a kind of deceptive rock star. You know that kind of thing; The Poseur singer, the beautiful boy who did not write any of the music, has no idea but gets all the glory for nothing and chickens for free. Therefore, he takes its success for granted, abuses it and ultimately destroys it with itself. In fact, Hoffman's honorable days suddenly ended when he was busted to treat cocaine, assaulted bail and hid. <br /> <br /> The second part of the movie deals with the time in hiding. In that, we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby who infinitely blames anyone, but even for his downfall. Eventually the times pass him completely; and he can never get it. How sad. The end. Close credits roll and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman ultimately committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I am sure this is not the image filmmakers intend to make in Hoffman in making this movie. Considering that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I am sure they intended this film as a kind of tribute to the life of a man who was, after all, an icon of the 60's and the left anti-war movement. In this they have failed miserably. The movie presents Abbie Hoffman as a thoughtless caricature. We are never told about what drives him. How did he come to his views? How did he manage to capture a generation's imagination? How did he organize such a great movement? Why was he involved in treating cocaine to a great extent by his fame? Why? Who knows, and since the filmmakers don't think that ultimately who cares?
