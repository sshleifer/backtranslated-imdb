This was a Hindi movie. Hindi = Horrible. reasons: cheap dialogues, cheap special effects, image registration + stretching a 2 hour maximum movie for 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... small %%%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Especially for this movie: 1. Dialogues are not fun. they are cheesy and cheap. Although akshay tried his best acting as I admired him, comedy was not fun at all! I laughed only 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the movie was useless for the story of the second half. The second half was the actual story / movie. The first half was time card / construction. 3. The signs are not developed correctly at all. paresh rawal is smart in the first half, an idiot in the second half / the rest of the movie. we do not develop any emotions or care for akshay and govinda. Their characters are stupid nothing more. they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. Witnesses are funny, but they are not fun in a very serious scene. The signs in the band and drug traffickers are cheeses and have been used in the last 20 films. There is nothing new about these signs. Again, they seem to be stupid to be funny. however, stupid = fun when stupid is the norm throughout the film. The only sign that made sense was lara napta with a real story. 4. Special effects were crap. At the end, plpl falls out of the ladder of a fire truck. You notice that they are not actually on the ladder in the air. Secondly, ppl begins to fly away when the ladder begins to move around. ppl cannot fly from a ladder as it moves ... they fall directly to the ground because of something called gravity. 5. The whole movie was dubbed. all the dialogs were recorded after the movie. The actors' lips are hardly synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap, but I can't remember them. look at this masterpiece of crappy indian movies by non-intelligent, even stupid, instructor himself and you will agree with my review. ppl who like hindi movies, please increase your expectations for decent quality in hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad. I like some. I didn't like this one. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the action of akshay and lara)
