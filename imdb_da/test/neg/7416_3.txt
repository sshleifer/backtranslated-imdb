Hi everyone, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. In fact, I was one of Make-up FX artists who helped create the "animal" for this movie, and I must tell you that the original creature looked amazing. I remember when we got the first pictures back from the set, we all talked about how much it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty bad. What actually happened was that Jason Palmer made the original makeup for Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and resume much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason died a few weeks before it, and then the finished creature was not as close to the original as it was. <br /> <br /> For me, it was pretty sad because it was Jason's final movie, and he kind of was cheated out of his final fame because of the bad re-shoots. Anyway, I thought you might find it a bit annoying and if you'd like you can switch to mmmyeah.com and check out some "behind the scenes" pictures. Later, Jeff
