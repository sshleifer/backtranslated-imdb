I watched this Hallmark television movie when it originally broadcast. I lost interest in history because a character is said to be a witch. I just wasn't in the right mind to watch this movie. But Hallmark stands for the best quality films. Now there is a reason to give this movie a different look. Clive Owen who plays "Damon Wildeve" may just have a chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes it on. Clive Owen may have to wait until 2008. The second reason is that the woman leader is Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at that time) and became an Oscar winner for Outstanding Support Actress in 2003. Joan Plowright as " Mrs. Yeobright "is also in this movie. I like the opening line of this movie: "Release my heart from this terrible, lonely place. Send me a great love from somewhere, or I'll die, really, I'll die."
