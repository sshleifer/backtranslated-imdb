Found this movie for a dollar ($ 1.00) and the movie was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown, (Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and managed to capture the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. However, Mark goes to the opposite side after some terrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. In a scene like Mark drinking in a hotel bar, his eyes glimpse of sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, without time for the comfort of a bed. This is a horrible movie and not worth wasting time to look at IT yourself.
