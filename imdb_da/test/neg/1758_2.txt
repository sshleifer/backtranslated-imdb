Her embalmed appearance was totally inappropriate for the role. Her face remained too white, also for her hair, clothes, etc. Too clean (and suitable, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other players to remain clean and perfect, but she was the only one who was not messed up. There was never even a dirt on her powdery cheek. Should we believe she was the only person in the civil war with a bathtub and a mirror? She looked very much like the only one who used them. Tweezers too; I mean, what's with these eyebrows? She definitely looked! <br /> <br /> The love story was impossible. She only went to the guy because someone told her he had said he thought she was sweet. Then she goes over to tease him and flew with him a couple of times, and that's suddenly a love on par with Odysseus and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I should have known better than expecting something better from the man who brought us "The English Patient." My reaction to one was the same as Elaines on Seinfeld: "It sucked."
