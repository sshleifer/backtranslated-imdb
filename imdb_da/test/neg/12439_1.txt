Sometimes I run into a movie that is so embarrassing, I wonder why there are movies. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and poor dialogue. Eddie Deezen is simply annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who, after his father, Don (William Hickey )'s request, takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's also cartoon-like. The most important point I'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of a recognized drama like The Godfather with so much cartoonishness. It doesn't work that way. Believe it or not, you must take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you do not take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. The thing about making a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody. You have to do it as if you are taking the movie at least a little seriously. It also feels like they are just mocking Woody Allen, and that's what makes this movie horrible.
