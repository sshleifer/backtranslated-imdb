Don't choose this one. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The reason for this aggravating bad movie is four friends talking about taking the shuttle from the airport to a very keen driver. On the space shuttle with them, a fairly milquetoast leads business type. <br /> <br /> Shortly in their turn, the shuttle bus driver takes an off-ramp and some lunatic drivers try to drive them off the road. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tires and the ball holes and the boys' fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle. It is at this time that the driver reveals being kidnappers and he has taken the whole people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie becomes extremely slow and dull as the characters do a lama thing after another. One of the men is killing trying to escape - though there is no excitement. Finally, it is revealed that the milquetoast business guy is in the cahoots with the driver when the milquetoast guy kills the other male friend by pushing his neck. <br /> <br /> There are a few attempts to escape the women. Milquetoast is hit over his head with a tire iron - yet he survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also beaten and somehow survived a head in collision with a high speed fence while kneeling beside the wheel. Somehow he did not go through the window or even seriously injured with a collision with the windshield. But the woman who runs the shooter fights with unconscious - but she had a wheel to protect her, and he had nothing between him and the windshield. He is ultimately able to suppress the women and make them an underground garage that is a front of human trafficking. One of the women is killed. The other sticks the driver in the leg with a good piece of the piece mirror and shoots / grazes him in the head, but he is able (in what must be a severely impaired condition - severe blood loss, two head injuries and a large bengash) to pull Her out of the shooter, pull her to a big box, throw her in and get it locked, all the time with her hard fighting him. <br /> <br /> Now, some people admired the message of the film about human trafficking and how it is happening today. This is a serious problem. But making an extremely boring movie on the subject does not entitle you to a higher rating.
