Don't make me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with great excitement that I could participate in the "Rolling Thunder" screening of the Parisian French cinemath√®que with surprise film on December 17, 2004. Of course, surprising films were The Exorcist and most were there for it (I was too). The movie was so finished, but the point, so P Schrader used excerpts from King's Return and another movie I forget (Was it Conan?). In any case, the film was completed. The lucky few (maybe 200 people) were told not to write about the movie on the Internet or magazines as it might have threatened its chance of being elected to the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then came the realization that the film might not be selected for the festival because of its quality: Never in my life had I experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience, as people went from being skeptical to scaringly clear on the full play. I couldn't believe how low the writer of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction was. <br /> <br /> Forced over-the-top acting thorough, silly ending, black and white moral, horrible FX's, worst takes on Christianity from Schrader ever, not even exciting, just boring as hell (no one sayings calculated) and surprising at all! Some good places, but unfortunately missed or at least not met the first hopes! In the end, I was 100 times more satisfied with Schrader penned Rolling Thunder and wanted my 2 hours back. <br /> <br /> Don't believe in hype, though the John Boorman movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and Billy Crawford casting, the poor guy doing his best, but what do you expect? He is now part of the small club with the worst casting errors ever! I give the movie a 1/5 just because I didn't leave the room, but I should have.
