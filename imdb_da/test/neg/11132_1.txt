Great concept, perfect characterizations and voices, but a complete waste of time. A real shame as it had been higher would probably not have been the bomb it was (is); too dependent on scatological humor, to begin with. I am surprised by comments from "educated" reviewers who refer to the "good science" behind this piece of puerile waste. Unlike "Finding Nemo" where (with little suspension of unbelievers) attention to detail was staggering, and science was as good as the context would allow, "Osmosis Jones" was utter obscenity; Don't let yourself be scared of science. Humor aimed at eight-year-olds, but the subject is more suited to some incessant teens.
