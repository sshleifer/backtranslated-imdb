(Some Spoilers) PRC quickie who has J. Carrol Naish plays Dr. Igor Markoff, who is not really Dr. Karkoff, but a fraudster who took over his identity back in Europe. The real Dr. Karkoff had an affair with Dr. Markoff's wife who led him to murder the real Dr. Markoff and then had his wife Lenore infected with acromegaly who made her look like "Elephant Man's" sister. This was done so that no one would ever look at her and he could keep Lenore all to himself; but the disturbed Lenore later came with his madman killing himself. <br /> <br /> This nut, the false Dr. Markoff, then, patches Patricia Lawrence, Wanda McKay, one evening at the theater, where her father Tony Lawernce, Ralph Morgan, a world-renowned pianist gives a concert. Enchanted by the lovely Patricia who is a dead call to her dead wife Lenore Dr. Markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes into extreme lengths to marry her, even though she has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> Having become ridiculous in his efforts to make Patricia fall in love with him, sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to as much as five times a day, Tony goes to see the crazy Dr. Mankoff to tell him he should stop annoying his daughter. It is so that Tony ends up being knocked out by the good doctor who injected him with a dose of acromegaly that makes him a somewhat stingy guy. With his hands and body swelling and unable to play his beloved piano Tony is told by his doctor Dr. Adams, Sam Flint, that the only one who can cure him of the terrible disease is nothing but Dr. Markoff! the person who gave it to him. <br /> <br /> The movie has the usual subplots with Dr. Markoff's assistant Maxine, Tala Birell, who is also in love with him jealous of the false doctor who makes a game for Patricia. There is also Dr. Markoff's hulking butler Glenn Strange, like his pet gorilla, is just a big clumsy oaf that can't even suppress Maxine, which is less than half the size. Strange ends up being bent on the head and knocked out cold by Patricia's girlfriend Bobby Blake, Terry Frost. With regard to the Gorilla, he turns out to be a big hair leash when he also tries to do in Maxine and gets chased away and unlocked in his cage by the dog Ace. Dr. Markoff in her desperation to get Patricia to marry him promises to cure her father only to get her father to break out of his chains and in the subsequent battle with him end up shooting Markoff's death with his own gun . <br /> <br /> There is a good end to this whole mess with Maxine, who knew so much about Markoff's cure for acromegaly as he did, and injected Tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new. The movie ends, as it started, with Tony playing the piano for a packed and happy house at the local theater.
