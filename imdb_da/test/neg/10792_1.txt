The reason has something about white hunters caught by a strain of white women in African jungles / plains. It's a turkey and some. What it really is is wildly inconsistent footage from early sound and silent movies mixed with poorly shot recent (for release) pictures of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla diet, seaports native to sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikini, horrible tale and a guy in a linen cloth with make up all over the body (racially insensitive I think the). This is a movie to sit and make fun of - but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. At any other time it will be a task to get through. It's a bad bad bad movie. Besides that, I'm speechless
