It really will be a blue Christmas if you submit to this family. I loved the original movie and this one was not worth its successor. In fact, for all intentions, it is not its continuation. Only one character from the original cast returns. Admittedly, the character was randomly the hilarious cousin Eddie, but he's simply not fun to be the protagonist of a movie. His niche is the huge relatives who perform zany antics - along with Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this movie for it to be successful and he certainly wasn't there. As far as I'm concerned, a movie is not a "Holiday" movie unless good ole 'Clark Griswold is at the helm.
