The Italians are undeniable gentlemen in the dubious "art" of tearing off and imitating movies. What they do is take an innovative, money-generating and foreign concept, maintain the basic plot and add a lot of actions, sleaze and political inaccuracy. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputable infamous movie and quite difficult to overcome in the form of slop and controversy? Well, I think you simply ignore everything about history building or silence, and focus fully on making something that is practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slave story "Mandingo" which was released a year earlier, but since the decision makers themselves were too lazy to think of another title, one should not expect anything that even resembles a narrative depth of character drawings, disturbing atmosphere or thought-provoking statements about intercultural relations. "MandingA" is pure and simply a sexploitation effort, where the plot only develops over the last ten minutes, in other words, when you stopped care long ago. The characters in this movie are a collection of despicable bastards that can be expected, of course, when dealing with wealthy and unpleasant white people operating a plantation in South America. The older and extremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a few "Mustache-of-the-Year" prizes) that exploit and extend the slings the slaves work for him. His mistress, who if I understood correctly, is also his cousin (?), Is a true bitch of a woman who enjoys evoking arguments and sneaking out of the house overnight to copy with crucified slaves. When the plantation's son returns from Europe after approx. 25 minutes of pure waste time, the plot begins to develop a bit. The beautiful young man has a couple of times sex with the bitch woman (even in front of the slaves, supposedly "demonstrating" how their masters do it?) But ultimately he falls in love with the daughter of the cherubic preacher. His romantic preferences, of course, make the bitchy woman angry with anger, and she discovers an awful cruel uplift that will change the life of the plantation forever. Hi ?? I just realized that this brief description of the plot actually makes "Mandinga" sound like an interesting movie! Well, it's NOT and I apologize if I raised any expectations. It's an incredibly boring and horrible movie to fight through, but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the "Mandingo" mentioned above. Much rather than ill-exploited, this film is a truly obvious portrait of one of mankind's darkest story pages, and it was also a properly produced movie with real actors, good music and impressive movie venues. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
