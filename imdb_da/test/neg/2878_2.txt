I read reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. I am a great frankophile and art film lover, but I think this is another case where critics do something "arty" or "intellectually" for something it is not. I want to be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perversion that I would never ever see. Of course, the piano teacher has some great psychological problems, but I really didn't want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is essentially disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a dream, I was dismissed by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not nearly the kind of disgust and rejection I felt during this movie.
