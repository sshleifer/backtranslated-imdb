The one-line summary is actually a punch line of a very old joke that begins "what is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> While this movie had its interesting moments, it was far too slow to move and didn't do enough to explain to us in the audience not familiar with Orthodox Jewish custom exactly what was going on and why? How many people who came across this movie would know that the bathtub in which the female characters washed in is actually called a "Mikveh", which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual impurity? The same question may be asked why the bride had walked around the groom a staggering number of times, while her face was covered just before the spouse's promises were made. These two examples are just two of a large number of such moments that remained completely inexplicable to the uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moving moments along with expressions of great love and emotion. The characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments that an ultra-orthodox Jewish man must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in as he wakes up in the morning to begin his day. The orthodox Judaism's attitudes towards women in general, and especially wives, are both exciting and sometimes galvanic. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context. I recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the Orthodox Jewish tradition and rituals as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief look at how life for people who practice this lifestyle is like. The story of two sisters, who in their own way rebel against the "system" has moderate interest in the best.
