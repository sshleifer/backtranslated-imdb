I'm like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But seeing a home production with other friends and family, with a decent camera and a good guy, is just not good movie making. <br /> <br /> Writing, direction, action and editing are at best absurd. But I sat through half of it. And why? <br /> <br /> This film provides perfect examples of what not to do; Spray it into movie school baskets all over the joints! <br /> <br /> So thanx Bam! Now I know Jackass is for real - because you're not looking to win an Oscar, guy :)
