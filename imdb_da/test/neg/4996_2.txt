Don't be misled. This is NOT a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all: the good and the terrible. Yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it is basically an artistic exercise in existentialist fear, which is far from saying it is boring. If you've worked hard all day and want to spend a few hours entertained, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" has cheap special effects, mediocre plays and crummy dialogue. All this is understandable in an indie, low budget movie, and I can forgive such mistakes as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" hardly has any history at all. Moreover, the play is not ridiculously bad as much as non-existent. All the actors seem to have studied at the Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would it have killed them to show some emotions? (And no, the shouting does not respond to emotions). The one character that actually had some pizazz was killed first. Granted, there was another character that briefly kept my interest. He looked and seemed like Kyle McLachlan channeling Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. Filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a little detail: movies are a VISUAL medium. That means illuminating your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually see what's happening. And all the artistic cuts and close-ups might have been cool at the time, but all they did was watch the movie and confusingly. There's nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear way - just look at George Romero's low budget "Living Deads Night" to see how it's done superbly. And I know that these people had a small budget, but if you can't hire equipment and technicians to actually make the dialogue audible, just go ahead and make a quiet movie (then these Buster Keaton wooden surfaces can actually function). <br /> <br /> I want to say this to the movie: The zombies were scary. Unlike most zombie films, where the undead is shown in all their destructive glory, the bigger the better the zombies here were just shuffling, bloody people. It actually worked to make them more like us, and therefore scary. That's why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. The sad part about all this is that, despite all its flaws, "The Resurrection of the Resurrection" does not offend your intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a clever, scary, original movie, and it is a shame that they mistakenly failed. If they could just leave it for fancy editing, buy a few extra light bulbs, turn up the dialogue and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to do something really good. <Br /> <br /> Believe in me: Don't waste your time on "the uprising of the uprising".
