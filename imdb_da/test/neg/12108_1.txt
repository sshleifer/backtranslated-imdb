If you want a truly traumatic experience, this is horrible movie (if you are considering calling it that) for you. A movie that is worse than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair game ... yes, you get my point. This movie directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an IQ of 25) can really be considered the worst movie ever made. I hope that Troma or anyone in America would distribute it, so u.s can experience the French stench worth it.
