Only watched this movie late last night. I remember the hype of it's release and to be honest I had seen it again so I might not have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the film shone over the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was also good - though he still wondered if he was stoned all the time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark, but not too dark and his character eventually let me down. For me, he should have been more confrontational with Demi - maybe throw her out or tell her she was paid for. After all, he would have examined them before he made the proposal - it is not shown in the film, but no one in his perceived position would have been able to offer anyone. He was cruel to break them up and the last straw was the house, and yet Demi fell to him? The passengers who gave an insight into Demi and Woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. There was a deep depth that blamed John Gage's character. He could really have been much stronger and, as other people have pointed out, I think the movie card was Redford and they didn't want to hurt his "image". I say what the fuck Robert was old in this movie! Woody and Demi's characters were naive in a way, but I thought it was very intent to draw to their situation and master their decision. But the reality is that they lost their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? To gamble what little they had left and then accept a suggestion from a crazy rich billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford seduced them a little too unrealistically. The movie could have been so much more, and other actors would have made a difference, but having said it on sennat tv - it was fun and I, if you don't think too much - also tasty
