Some aspects of this production are good, like the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one distracted by Betsy Josly's terrible performance as Johanna? She's horrible! She slaves the songs with her screaming voice and overcomes in a role she clearly does not understand. I also think the choir is not snuff. They pull the pace and make the worst facial expressions. All in all, I think this production is okay, but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done right. This production does not come close to the level this material requires. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
