Snakes on a Train is a movie I rented because of the pure amusement of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on a Plane was an enjoyable action movie, so of course the filmmakers wanted to pay off the success of this low budget effort. In 85 minutes, Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable to witness. I had to pause the movie to do something to entertain myself because of the lack of events in the movie. For the duration of the film, it is never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she continues to cough this green / purplish goo constantly. Not only is there endless boring dialogue between the two main characters, Brujo and Alma discussing how to get rid of the curse. I appreciate low budget film production. I'm not really scary on movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is really one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the authors of acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly become a giant snake? and most importantly how on earth was it capable of consuming the train? <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Snakes on a Train is a movie to be avoided at all costs. Don't be excited as if I was at the title, this is a movie that is seriously bad. Let us rest these snakes <br /> <br /> 0/10
