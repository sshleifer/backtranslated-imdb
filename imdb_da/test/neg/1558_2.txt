Zarkorr is a bad movie. This does not even consider it so badly its good category. It's just bad. From the (lack of) set design to the play for special effects, everything about this movie stinks. Initially, the movie looks like it was filmed in just empty spaces with a few props thrown in to make it look good. Then we get plays that are so bad that it does a high school, looks like it was an Oscar candidate. And to top it all, there are the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them out in their garage. The cities that the monster is supposed to crush resemble my nephew's train set. So, of course, false that they are screaming at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. It's just too bad that they spent all their budget on it and left nothing for the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would also have helped.
