I was thinking of this movie when I looked at the pluto nash ... why .. because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot, made this movie years earlier, but probably written by a screenwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something. .. Who ... AVOID ALL COSTS, even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman, is hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch the taxi reruns on latent TV ... the character of his latka is so much more lovable ... TANK I BERRY VERY
