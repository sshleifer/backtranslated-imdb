For me, this movie was simply confusing, slow and uninteresting. Why did foreigners choose to communicate through ants? It makes no sense. The end was muddled and made no sense at all. In the end, I was hoping that the ants would kill everyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. Not even MST3K could save it.
