This movie is stupid and very short to be a fun movie. Unhappy 'easterners' are not happy to be out west; so they hire a dunk truckmaster (John Candy) to lead them back east. Sieve guard was just not fun enough to wear it. And Richard Lewis comes quickly to your nerves; But then I honestly don't like him on anything he does. Ed Lauter is funny as the creepy villain. <br /> <br /> The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died of a massive heart attack ten days before the film was completed. A tripod and digital enhancement enabled Candy's character to be seen in the final stages. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some really good knee joints, his stomach laughing in his career. This movie was just not the best caliber. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie you will recognize: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
