Absolutely not your typical Polizia, Redneck just never worked for me. The film tells the story of a jewel heart gone wrong and a young boy who was accidentally kidnapped in the process. In their attempt to get away, the robbers leave a bloody death path in their wake as they close a plane to loosen the boy. The plan is never interrupted as robbers have more intention to come to France, and the boy intends to stay with them. While I could mention a number of issues I had with the movie, would I focus on the most obvious? drawn Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films such as Crime Boss to his most remembered role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I've always thought of him as an unkind customer. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unattainable in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotically as possible? It could not have been too bad if his actions had been done in the context of a plot I was worried about, but here he seems to be bizarre to be bizarre. It seems to be random lunacy. And what about that accent? Savalas could have been many things, but southern is not one of them. He sounds ridiculous, even trying to accent. Besides that, I found little interest in the rest of the film. As I stated, the plot never took me. I just didn't care what was going on. And the idea that the boy is so attracted to the criminal lifestyle, does not ring true. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas, and the normally reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "name" actors and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse, I think the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots. I couldn't tell what was going on. Characters I hate, a plot I don't care about, and a production value that failed ?? a bit odd, I've given Redneck a 3/10.
