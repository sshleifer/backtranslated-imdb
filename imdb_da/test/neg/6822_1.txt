I sit here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. This led to a discussion of other major late 80s films. The ridiculous Tunrer and Hooch, K9 connection came up. <br /> <br /> Granted I have never seen K9PI and if I still appreciate my life, I will never. Joshua quotes this as his film of the year. Wow. Wow. I'm completely surprised that this movie exists. But so much more than the fact that Joshua likes this feature disturbs me to the core. I think Joshua is an interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
