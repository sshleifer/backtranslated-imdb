This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. My uncle's home videos have more talent in them, so this shot. <br /> <br /> The plot collection is basically that these twin kick boxers play a sick survival game with a man and his private army on an island. The man has a very cheap paper mach√© look. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible in this movie. There are scene changes at the hat. Eg. For at least 30 seconds, we see a guy who lobsters a song to himself that doesn't add anything to the movie. This has the worst dialogue I've ever heard of in my life, I don't think this movie can get worse as it is already. I would describe it as a desire to be chuck Norri's action movie gone wrong. And I hate chuck Norris.
