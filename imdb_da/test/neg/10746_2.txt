I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent showtime horror anthology series, but it was easily the worst of the pile. It's really bad. Part of this may be due to the poor, odd, choice of source materials. Why did Joe not just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode, where "the message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the scene, everything and, ultimately, I just wondered if it could get worse, and I won't ruin it ... but it ended up get worse. What stinks of such a talented creative team. Skip this one and buy John Carpenter one instead. It manages to balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision, and it's fun. Homecoming is as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep.
