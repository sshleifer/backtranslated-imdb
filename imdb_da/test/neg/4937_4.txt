"Shuttle" is an indie thriller about four young adults taking a ride late one night on a bus from the airport to find out the driver is a sadistic psychopath. Although some of the sequences of scare and it's unconventionally interesting plot work, some aspects just don't. The bad dialogue and unlikeable signs give a good reason not to worry about them. But often the excitement works and asks you "What would you do?" And usually what you would do is not what these idiots on the shuttle do. <br /> <br /> If you expect a thoughtless, bloody horror movie, you will fail. This is a movie that makes you use your mind but unfortunately not to the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
