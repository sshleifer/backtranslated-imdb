My, my, mine: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance must have been desperate to have lent their talents to this turkey. A terribly confused story of Satanism in modern Greece, the Land of Minotaur (aka The Devil's Men) is an abuse of more or less all levels thought. It has precious few scares (always a small mistake for a "horror" movie, don't you think?); weak performance; countless scenes where characters foolishly walk alone or strike the opportunity to remain in the group's security; and some rather annoying editing methods that don't add anything at all to the case. I was prematurely thrilled with the prospect that Cushing and Pleasance worked together 17 years after The Flesh and The Fiends - but this movie is not worth getting distant on; It is a great disappointment and rather embarrassment to its very worthy leader. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, extras like tourists and archaeologists have disappeared, and local pastor Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something creepy is coming. He writes to his friend, New York's private eye Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras) and asks him to fly out to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, there are three visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling) who are all personal friends of Father Roche - miss while snooping around in nearby Greek ruins. Milo eventually arrives in Greece, but is initially doubtful about Father Roche's belief that the missing people have been shaken by satanic victims. Milo and father Roche are also with Laurie (Luan Peters), the girlfriend of the missing man Tom. Together, they uncover the activities of a Minoan devil-worshiping cult led by the scary carpathian exile Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultures have formally sacrificed their victims to a statue of the minotaur. Moreover, they apparently cannot be killed in normal ways, so Father Roche must use a number of religious artifacts in his fight against them. Minotaur land should have been much better than it actually is. The reason is so crazy and unlikely that it has all the characteristics of an enjoyable giant cult / camp favorite. But the handling is just awful. Director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to link the story together so that the whole process progresses as it was made daily. He also has no idea how to convince convincing beliefs from his cast that they are left to be ashamed of either terrible hammy (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateurish (Skouras, Peters) beliefs. What's worse is that the story doesn't make sense. Why would Father Roche seek help from a private eye that is completely flippant over his beliefs? How does Roche know that the victims only occur during a full moon? How can the minotaur statue speak? Why was one of the sacrificial victims instructed under a vision to stab Father Roche, only to be stabbed a few scenes later before being given the opportunity to do so? And - most amazing of all - why does Pader Roche Milo draw halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucified and some holy water to dispose of the evil ones? These questions - and more - come to mind in the Minotaur country .... but unfortunately there is no answer to have had. Terrible, stupid and disappointing!
