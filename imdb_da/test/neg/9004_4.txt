I had little hope for this hour-long film of footage from old Poverty Row movies. Certainly, it had the opportunity to act as more than a home video mass marketed to the world. Unfortunately, it's fun that this movie still feels like a home video, but with stock footage spliced ​​in. The plot relates to the planned reading of a will on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship sinks and well ... it's the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie promises Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others to be lifted from old movies to interact with new footage. We get it good, but for the most part we get lots of new video recordings made to look like scratchy black and white film, where new actors are looking forward to. Old recordings are cut off mostly to set the scene, but very little of the old and the new matches actually, it's obviously just a set on. It is not very convincing and is very disappointing that someone like me was looking for a better constructed movie. <br /> <br /> Even if you know and love the old Pussycat films (it is very spoofy), it may be worth viewing. I will warn against buying this, but it can be for about five bucks, the price of a rental), so the choice is yours (although you can get away with not paying for it). <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
