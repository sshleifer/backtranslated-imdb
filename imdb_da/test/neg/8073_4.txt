I remember vacationing in Florida when this movie was broadcast. I had set up my VCR to record it. The expectation killed me. I had known about the film ever since it was announced half a year earlier. We came back from Florida 4 days after the movie aired and I immediately saw it. I tried as hard as I liked it, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> I'm a big 3 stooges fan. And as such, I know very little about them. So it wasn't as if I expected to learn anything from the movie, and I didn't. I was more interested in the portrayals and how exactly their information was. There were many things wrong with this movie. The actors, the script, the reenactments, ALL could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is an incredibly talented actor. But let's see the facts, Moe Howard was WAY outside his reach. He doesn't look like him, he doesn't sound like him, and so he can't act like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his portrayal of Curly did not score quite with me, but when Curly gets sick he did very well. John Kassir's portrayal of Shemp could have been more advanced. It was more of a bad impression than a portrayal. Worst of all was Joe Besser. They made him skinny and more annoying than he really was. It was just plain laziness. I don't like Joe shorts because, as the movie illustrates, he was hardly ever hit. But he wasn't that annoying, and DEFINITELY wasn't that thin. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate stooge portrait. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is far too frizzy and way too red. I know it's too technical so I'm not counting it on my list of why I didn't like this movie. Back to Shemp, who just happens to be my favorite stooge. He is written as a whirling, shaking, chicken. True, he had many phobias, but he wasn't that bad. He did not leave the group originally because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like him, left Shemp because he received a quote from another studio which he simply could not beat. Instead of the truth, this film chooses to make him wet the bed, on Larry no less, run into a closet and shamefully bend out of the group. Another problem is that Shemp made almost as many Columbia shorts as Curly did as a stooge, but only one, Fright Night, who was his first card, is shown. His career was almost completely ignored. In addition, miserable editing caused a terrible and most unforgiving error. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died in late 1955. That would make him so old at death? Well, here's a tip, it's not 59 the movie says. <br /> <br /> Now for the writing, which I thought was flawless, only because this movie was rushed out. Some of the lines are stupid and could be developed and / or introduced much better than they were. The one line that really got me was at the end of the movie when Moe shows the promoter how the eyes are done. "How we do it, contact with the forehead, not the eyes, but really look at movies." This line was poorly written and poorly placed in the movie. It's supposed to be one of the lines that make the audience say OH! Marveled, and I'm sure it did with some people, but at the end of the movie was not the place for that line. A better place you ask? How about when they get to Columbia for the first time and introduced to the sound effects. I know initially that there was no sound to the eye box, but Moe could, for example. Having said, "What about this?" and eyepokes Curly or Larry. Jules White then says "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" There were many misplaced lines in this movie, which is a clear sign that the manuscript was shaking. Another involves the origin of the name Shemp, although one is not so bad, and then I will let it slip. <br /> <br /> What works this movie well? It illustrates how stooges were screwed by Columbia as they were. I'm not sure if Moe was an honorary boy, but it was the kind of dramatization that is supposed to make the viewer sympathize with them. I know this movie was a dramatization. I don't know that everything gets sharp and clean and absolutely perfect. But some of the things they made up and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's blow is not even close to the way it happened in reality. I know, I know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatization is to make real events more dramatic. Curly's real-life stroke is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. Here's what really happened. Curly sat in a chair on the screen while a scene was shot, they called him the final piecemeal scene, but there was no answer. Moe went to take him and discovered that his little brother's head went down, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears streaming down his face. Moe then said "Babe?" and tried to help him out of the chair. Badly curled drops to the knees. So called the ambulance. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie wasn't horrible, but it was definitely not good or even OK. This film depicts the helpless helpless and inaccurate and sometimes overboard with dramatizations. There is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this movie. If you don't believe me, check out a trap named Stooges list on the threestooges.com forum. It's about a half and a half. Some things in the movie I can let slip. But others were unforgivable. The three stooges were geniuses, and much of today's comedy is based on what they did. Don't believe me? Check out the Simpsons, and more then Ren & Stimpy. But this movie fails to capture their genius. It is so much more inaccurate to catch their hardships, which is important, but if the movie's title becomes the three stooges, it will increasingly spread its inventiveness and originality.
