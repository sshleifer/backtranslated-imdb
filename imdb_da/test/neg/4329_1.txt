Imagine seeing a slideshow where the projector dwells on each slide for a sufficient length of time to fully remember it three times. Imagine now that the slideshow pictures consist of worldly scenes only? a small park; and empty tennis court a piano. Now imagine that the people who run the slideshow have a frustrating slow, half-hearted conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they show you. Store ?? you just imagined the whole movie `India Song '. <br /> <br /> The movie is a disturbingly slow montage of pictures that do little, except just screaming out 'Look at me! I'm PROFOUND !! 'with such obvious self-meaning, that the images themselves and the film as a whole are made not only deprived of proficiency, but largely deprived of depth. The visuals could easily have been replaced by a number of static images as described above, as it is so rare that there are actually people on the screen, and even when they are, the people move only slightly more often than the furniture. They never speak or interact in any meaningful way ?? they are just standing there looking at each other and occasionally crying. The most energetic moment of the whole movie's first hour is when three people cross a parking lot in slow motion. In fact, the pictures could easily be omitted as the story is told entirely through narration. The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot, and hate people don't hate India because it's hot (this point is covered several times). It is also about a man who feels that he has the right to sleep with the aforementioned woman when she wants to sleep with everyone who asks her, but he does not go to bed with her simply because he never asks and he is Very sorry about this. Then he stares at her as a single tear runs deep into his cheek. Later he stares at his bike, as a single tear runs deep down on his cheek. In fact, you won't see the only tear that runs deep into his cheek as he stares at his bike, but you know it's there anyway, just because it's the kind of movie it is. </p> <p> At best, the narrative becomes a backdrop that serves as a perfect compliment to the companion-making images. Just by raising awareness throughout this film would require a supreme determination. Seeing it and actually getting away with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what it should be about would cause the same kind of migraine to try to read long technical documents in the dark. This movie is perhaps the largest monument of pseudo-artistic pretension that you will ever know.
