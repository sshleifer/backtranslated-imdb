Bad, bad movie. When I saw synopsis, I waited for something like Calling only with video games instead of tape. Nothing of the sort happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and can be transformed into a good movie, but it is not. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, choosing a real person, Countess Bathory, is stupid, adding absolutely nothing to the story. Anyone even vaguely familiar with his story would start to wonder why and how did this Hungarian noblewoman agree in this movie. Choosing a generic revenge would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> There is the whole you-die-in-reality-as-you-die-in-the-game concept. As I said before interesting, Ring-like story. But instead of developing it into a good story line, it's just flowing along with no explanation given why this game was like it's why it was created and so on. Waste of good idea. <br /> <br /> And finally, this movie doesn't even have gory of funny parts that can, if not save at least, make crappy horror movies visible. Death scenes are too fast, and acting is for wood to be fun. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
