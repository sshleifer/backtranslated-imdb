My spoiler is in my pants because the thought of this movie made me so angry that I shot myself. <br /> <br /> When you're done watching it, you're staring at the TV in confusion and horror. Then there is a soft touch on your shoulder and a voice hovering: "You will die for seven days." You turn around and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one who suggested this movie when you were in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I don't want to lie: this is the worst movie on Earth's surface. I saw it with 5 of my friends all 18 year old boys, and that was our reaction: -A person actually started crying and beating himself -A person screamed and went out. A person stood up and staggered out of the front door to popping up more than an hour later - A person simply knocked out (one was me). One person began to babble incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and Tourett's syndrome. A person entered a kind of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie is really so bad. There is a part where the retarded cameraman actually travels (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it. Seriously, you can hear him shallow and swear when he hits the ground. There is only one special effect and it is especially that a retarded child trying to solve a Rubix Cube is special: the camera rotates so on-screen action (action, n. Some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes) makes a barrel roll. Under no circumstances should it be seen and the film itself warns you of this fact. Do you know what the tagline on the back is? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly believe that publishing this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the manufacturer's side. However, it is not to say that you should pass it if you see it in the film business - it would then be on the shelf to see some other bad sucker. Instead, buy each copy of what you can get your hands on and send them to people you hate.
