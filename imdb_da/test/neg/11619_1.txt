I can't believe this horrible movie was made by the same people who made Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. See it and skip this. The foundation is muddled and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suppose the editor went on holiday halfway through the movie because quick, choppy cuts start to appear, which only confuses relationships rather than illuminating them. Nor does the end make sense. <br /> <br /> This is predominantly a propaganda film made so that Serbs can undo themselves and revitalize America for the NATO bombings in 1999. They do this by continuing the lies of Serbs being our allies during World War II claiming the whole world is unfair to them and completely ignores everything Slobodan Milosevic has said and done as waging war on three neighboring countries. They seem to intend to make a political film, but only show a few seconds of Milosevic on a television screen without sound. Of course, a nationalist agenda replaced every consideration of art that was not the case with Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this movie to a teacher when it played last week at the Seattle International Film Festival. He also quoted the bad editing and confusing plot, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You have been warned.
