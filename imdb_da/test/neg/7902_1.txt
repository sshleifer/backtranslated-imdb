Wow this is really stereotypical, terrible bin. I'm sorry for anyone who might have wasted their money to see this. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I'm not laughing at all this movie, I just can't believe they would make such a horrible movie. <I will now be more careful when watching movies in late night. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie that exists (though it could be), but I don't think I've seen anything so stupid and unfunny for my life. It makes the Scary Movie series look intelligent. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 0 if they would let me
