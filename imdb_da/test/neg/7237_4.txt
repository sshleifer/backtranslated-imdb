I hated the first movie is really boring and we only see the squid at the end. <br /> <br /> The plot of Dead bodies is located in the New York Harbor. The police have no trace or suspect until Nick and his colleague realize the killer is a huge squid. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses to believe in Nick's history, and soon the harbor is filled with boats for the 4th of July celebration ... In this movie we see more of the Giant Cephalopods and special effects for this movie are really good for it is time. <br /> <br /> The play is this movie not bad, but not great too, but okay and look capable. <br /> <br /> There are some real movie scenes for movies, but if you get past it, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
