Would it be too tired of me to make a review of just me saying the word "STUPID" over and over again? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I watched this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party, as it was still in theaters. Although it was actually * with friends * and on one of their * birthday parties, * I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I excused myself and went out. Fortunately, some of the parents did the same, so I didn't look like a total jerk ... Anyway, this movie is horrible. There is nothing to like about it. It is painful (which in fact causes physical pain) slow and morbid (provoking literally vomiting) unfunny. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but you don't, because you remember he was actually in the movie. It really makes me think about it myself. <br /> <br /> It was on TV a few months ago, and I decided I had to see it all, just once. I then remembered why I went out in the first place and felt guilty of increasing his ratings of another viewer. Gags are not fun, the characters are not interesting. It's just a pointless mess on chat and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of then-eight-year-old children who watched the movie as it came out and considered it "brilliant". If you think having your face removed piece by pece with an ice cream scoop is brilliant, then at all, go rent it. But if you have any dignity at all, avoid this big STUPID mess completely. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.
