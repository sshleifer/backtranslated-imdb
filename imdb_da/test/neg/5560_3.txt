This is a silly movie. Like many of these karate films, it is poorly written, awkward and sometimes just stupid. The action is really not all there and the film generally gives a lot to be desired. Everyone here speaks jive, does bad karate and does a very bad job of acting. <br /> <br /> Watching Scatman Crothers in a small role, he's too good at this movie in general. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. Everyone is there as many parts for this movie that makes absolutely no sense. The supposed love / run scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? They destroyed the man's guitar, for no reason! <br /> <br /> Then there were the obligatory girls on trampolines !!! What was it now? They were in the movie for five seconds, so you never heard from them again !!! Then there is the whole racially charged element in the movie, which is cool and everything, but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere. As I said, it is good to laugh once, but don't see it again.
