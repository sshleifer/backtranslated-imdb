My wife and I couldn't even finish the movie. Really it was quite painful. <br /> <br /> First, the historical accuracy is not so much compromised by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For example, Augustus only takes the "burden" of power with great reluctance. In fact, he is portrayed as being a kind of great humanist and believer in democracy. <br /> <br /> The other, the camp! My lord, the dialogue is terribly bad. I remember the soap opera my mother watched as I was a child who had better dialogue than this. The constant display and pontification of the lattice on the ears as nails on the board. Ugh. (Okay, I'm exaggerating a little, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO series Rome is superior for no other reason than its character was least credible, regardless of their historicity. Rome was also clever enough to know that they could not cope with epic battle scenes. The creators of this movie did not. When Caesar attacks Munda, the battle scene is practically farcical. <br /> <br /> I want to admit that the costumes are really good. The sets are fine, although their CGI backgrounds can be a bit crushing at times. The sound is bad, though ?? both in terms of music, foley work and dubbing of so many of the page characters. It is not worth renting anyway. As a history story, I hoped for an alternative approach to Augustus than HBO's Rome, which I felt failed to capture his overall "feel" as well as they did to Emperor or Antony. Instead, I should just have the fence for my reading.
