Okay, it was very good ... but best picture? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, good night and good luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - Well, it should have won! Academic voters seem to act as the present day Democrats - just a little of everyone, but dare not take concrete positions. That's why we have a complete moron at the office in the United States. <br /> <br /> This has been the WORST AA presentation ... and forgets 1987 ... ever before. Hollywood is so scared it's the bottom line that it can't be set "straight". Many voters did not even show Brokeback Mountain. Get it right and bring it along. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic year since I saw in the mid 60's and I was only two. Wake up who you are. Hollywood is mainstream, and it has happened to Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the last Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a remake or anything by Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more to come in 2006 . <br /> At least there were original best pictures, that is, Munich, but heard one before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, although we now know that Reese can sing as a Cash / Carter, etc., Syriana was a much better picture than Crash. That movie has been made since the early 1960s and we have to make the best movie? What a horrible Oscar night and a terrible year ends in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least, BAFTA went for the best picture for Brokeback and what about the terrible song that won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years back as America or the United States before anyone comes in and changes things a little. Maybe it will be China as they own so much of this country ... or India because they have all the high tech jobs and are the biggest democratic country in the world. America has become the fat of the fat, the pathetic and the stupid. Waste can be found in more places than Florida, West Virgina, South Dakota and in the middle of the west. Drive through a local McDonalds or Burger King for the sake of goodness. Order everything you want until you have a heart attack. Get out of your misery.
