I tried to watch this movie, but I did not pass the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment considering the cast, but I can't overlook the fact that the dialogue is in English, and some of the actors pretending to be Indian aren't even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Given that India alone has 1/6 of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been difficult for the filmmakers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play that part. And I'm not saying this because of some blind patriotism, but because it's completely and absolutely absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now some people say that 'as long as she convinces who cares?' but my point is that she is not convincing and can never be - not because of her acting skills, but because of her ethnicity. For example, how well an actor Tom Hanks might be, he will never be able to play an Australian aborigine! <br /> <br /> But it's still less to the biggest faux pas that the filmmakers made: having dialogue in English. It completely destroys the mood, as well as any kind of authenticity. Had the same movie been in native language (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this may have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately, as things stand, I would not recommend anyone to watch it, except for movie students wishing to study "What not to do" in movies.
