God, I have never felt so offended throughout my life, than with this crap. There are so many ways to describe this piece of shit that I think if I said everything that came to mind, I would be banned by this site. How do I begin? Well for that it does not know the original series knowing that this movie is a blow to the face of people who have seen it. The biggest slaughter of a themed song ever made is here, from a metal version to a freaking RAP VERSION, what did they think? How does Underdog and an electronic heavy match match? The story is so basic that I want to do something I don't normally do and don't even give a summary. Just think about this: A dog gets super powers, fill in the rest. It is so predictable that this movie is. And then comes the jokes .... you must kill me now. This humorous style, which may not even make the kids laugh, is so bad, well, expect the punch line after sneezing. It was a little fun. But what surprises me most is why Jason Lee (New name is earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim) are all here. In the films / movies shown, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job, and apart from Lee are the best actors in this movie, but it says very little. The rest deserves Golden Rasberry nominations for this crap. I'm very sorry to see such good actors buried by this disaster. All in all, it is just as bad as Doogal, which I also went through, and again my head would explode if I saw anything worse than this.
