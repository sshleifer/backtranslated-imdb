What happened to RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie that you have to stop and decide where to start - first and worst - the music. Each scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that tells you the mood, completely pathetic, I could add. Secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we ask if the projector is still working? And finally - if you want Indians godfather and godfather 2 - be aware that many of us have looked in. Nayakan was a ripoff of GF1 but better done and more entertaining. I have seen a similarity in both Company and Sarkar, and while RGV's Ab Thank 56 was brilliant, these two films leave something to be desired. People will not be more impressed by just corrupt politicians and the party. Maybe RGV should see Maqbool, which is good enough to be RGV !!
