Okay. I have really tried to grab the (so-called) stupid and surrealistic humor that this movie turns out to be. I am told that the Japanese version of this movie is much shorter than the one sent to America (go figure!), And has less political references. Apart from all that, I found this sexual / political farce just as boring and meaningless as standard porn. The central women's lead is easy on the eyes and could actually work. I would love to see her in a non pink movie where she could actually bend her acting muscles (and no, not the ones you think of). It is obvious that Japan can (and does) make as much crap as other countries. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, with the distant option of anyone having a Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
