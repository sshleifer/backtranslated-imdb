After watching this movie on TV, I saw it in IMDB and, to my surprise, imagine a user rating of 7.6! This is not a good movie. Especially bad is editing; the bad way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a big distraction. It is not very fluid done. I agree that the play was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and the story was exciting enough.
