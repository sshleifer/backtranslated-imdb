Let me start by saying that I love horror movies. Big budget, low budget, big name actors, no names actors, it doesn't matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I'm very forgiving. However, this movie is pretty bad. The actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines, and the play is worse than many lower budget horror flicks I've seen. As the actors are turned off, you can fit less. There is very little going on (I have no idea which movie other reviewers have seen when they say there is good doing in this because it is not) and the special effects are at best less. They steal so much from so many better horror films (Jeepers Creepers, Friday the 13th, Leprachaun), and it still doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I saw this at Showtime and didn't have to pay extra money to watch it or waste a seat on my Netflix queue on it. There are so many better horror movies out there, and I recommend you see them instead of this big down.
