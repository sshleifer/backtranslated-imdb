I'm a huge Randolph Scott fan, so I was surprised and disappointed to find that he is hardly in this movie! The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero of the jam, and one was in the love triangle. Good sadness, Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie !! For many viewers this is not a problem, but I come from the Walter Brennan school of sidekicks, not Gabby Hayes ... although I would say his lines were a little more humorous than annoying in this movie than in many of his film with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. Personally, I found the movie very slow, with a dilapidated plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance's subplot. In the case of complexity, it does not mean impossible to understand or find out, I just mean too messy for his own good. The direction is uninspired, and the two most important evil ones have the most unsatisfactory conclusion at the end. The whole movie comes across as fake, unrealistic and poorly filmed. <br /> <br /> Just so you don't think I can't find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her too short parts of this movie. Not sure if it's actually her song or another, but who it was, had a very beautiful voice. Mrs Jeffreys also had a few good actor moments. The script needed either much more of her, or to completely remove her character. As it was, her lovely moments were not enough to help the movie. Finally, there is Mr. Scott. He looks amazing in this movie and is the non-nonsense lawyer out to set things right. Some people complain that his character before 1950 was too good-good enough perfect, but it never bothered me. I take him well before 1950 or gritty and fierce after 1950 ... Randolph Scott was a true western hero. It makes me say so, but I have to recommend passing this movie unless you are a die-hard fan ... there are so many better Scott movies out there that this won't be missed.
