This is an amazingly bad action movie. I would say that the primary fault is that it lives. Argh! Funky wardrobes, retro chic set designs and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer. Against Squad's second (big) mistake is its lack of character development - underlined by the players' lack of talent. I tend to like Claire Danes work so I was totally surprised by her non-existent performance in this movie. Giovanni Ribisi is terribly displeased: how could his cotton-lined, bumbling-engaging style fit into an action girl? As for Omar Epps, he has to take a few plays to learn how to emote. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save yourself a pair of pants and wait to see this turkey on cable.
