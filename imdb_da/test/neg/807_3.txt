Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountaineer (probably the Ozarks) who is hunting with his favorite coon dog. However, the dog seems to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps in after him. Obviously, it soon becomes that, despite Hunnicutt and his dog roaming after leaving the water, they both died in the water - as no one responds when he speaks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. But strangely, Hunnicutt is really slow on recording and it takes him a while to understand that they are talking about him! I think it was actually done as padding, as there really wasn't enough material to fill half an hour's time gap. <br /> <br /> Later, in the "surprise twist" he comes to heaven - or at least his concept of the place. He is invited in, but since they do not allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, reasonably well-behaved but questionable spiritual value! With no twist or irony, this episode is a bit boring - not "Twilight Zone-y" enough for my taste.
