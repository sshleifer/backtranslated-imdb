If you pack all the clich√©s about the city's firefighters for 105 minutes; you have Ladder 49. <br /> It has a story but is very cloudy of all the cliches. It becomes movie as with every event; Being so predictable, it's not worth seeing. There is no depth to the story, and even the play seems superficial. It looked like it would be a tribute to firefighters, but ended up being boring and pretentious. The parallel between Jack Morrison was jailed under an inaccessible part of a building, and firefighters were trapped under Twin Towers rubble was too obvious. It does not compare to films like Backdraft and certainly does not set an example of future films about fire crews.
