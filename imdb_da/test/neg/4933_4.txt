The beginning was decent; the end was okay. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie suffers from complete and superficiality of the characters, unrealistic confrontations / combat situations, lack of any intelligent outside the shooter. This gives a terrible middle play. <br /> <br /> Things to look for: too obvious foreshadowing, quick cures, overly smoky fires, fun safety belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4, not a 0, because the start of the movie had some good elements of happiness and basic character development. The relationship between the largest, dark-haired girl and her fianc√© is briefly touched, and the location of the blonde friend's impact on this relationship is present, but unfortunately. The company discovered at the end becomes more common and decent, but as another commentary pointed out, not unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> ~ viper ~
