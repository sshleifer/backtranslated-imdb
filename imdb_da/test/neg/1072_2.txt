Honestly, Mr Thalluri .... if you make a drama movie in a high school after a lot of teens through a school day and if you ruin the timeframe and jump back and forth ... if you do, you can't use the exact same visual history tell the unit of "Elephant" that uses a camera that passes from one character to the next and has scenes shown 3 times from different angles. You just can't do it because it's such a blunt rip off it's hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating. Where "Elephant" (which was released 3 years before this movie) uses school shootings (or to be precise Columbine shooting) as the focal point of its script 2:37 uses teen suicide and see the notifications the shock value of that subject worked. It is the same long story that tells a lot of dramatic piano music that all lead to a finale you know from the beginning. At least, the signs look as if they were trying to be something different in that department. So you have an unusual gay guy who looks like a stoner / skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't handle his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family who both have their own problems and here comes nose dive. <br /> <br /> You also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever ... a guy with medical conditions who bets his pants because of "2 urethra syndrome" that actually never Have heard about the invention of diapers, but rather piss their pants in the classroom and then switch to new clothes and do it every single day! WOW, as hard as this movie is trying to be realistic, it's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is popped up in the toilet and is, of course, ashamed of it, but does not dry the blood of his nose as he walks through the school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. It is the new age realism that directly leads to "twist" and the final character, which turns out to be the suicide violation ... <br /> <br /> Having seen the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day including incest-rape, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental censorship and appearance and the gay topic mentioned before, like your "very realistic" daily soap ... trying hard to be) we see a girl die we met once at the beginning of this movie and who has no reason, but that the guy she was in love with, left the room when she spoke to him (in a thoughtful piano player sequence BTW, looked somewhere before ??). And it gets even better ... before she hits the wrist in a painful long scene of "Yes" and "No" she asks the 2-urethra guy, if he is OK, was constantly smiling and then cutting her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie that is a total rip-off of Elephant, fails with some really sloppy stories tale (the whole rape-incest thing was also pretty incredible) and people call this a shocker. <br /> <br /> What the heck is going on? Is it all necessary to take a little pseudo-dramatic music, boring storytelling and add a chock at the top and people think there's a big message here? I think the Elephant is already much overestimated, but that movie was the original, while this is an obvious rip-off that doesn't go on many more levels. I have never seen a more brazen steal of a whole movie concept in my life ... and believe me I was watching hundreds of horror movies so I know how low you can go there. This is a total downturn in all departments ... it's not realistic either, it's stolen, its damn slow and in every way I wonder what is more useless ... another romantic suicide (many give this point for the film, which makes me wonder they only look at Romeo + Juliet all day because there are dozens of movies dealing with the subject in a clear, non-romantic and more realistic way) or this ridiculous set-up .. . Come again! I'm still trying to work out if the 2-urethra guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.
