I see that the majority of the comments so far have been, if not too positive, so at least positive. I do not understand. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the movie, because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It makes "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" look like horror masterpieces. The play is at best shaken and terrible for the most part. The whole movie is almost whitish, probably so they could shoot it all in the same place. The monster resembles something from one of Roger Corman's worst movies. And the plot ... the less it said about the better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
