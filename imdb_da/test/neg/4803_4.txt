While it's one of two movies on the Tales of Voodoo Volume 1, there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it! The box marks the "Hell Hole", but the screen title is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole (1978) aka "Escape from Women's Hell Hole" A group of women bathing in a river and apparently the worst they have to worry about, a look empty, which they easily override. No nudity in this or any other scene. But a woman named Cardena drives up a car and seems to be known and wanted by all the women. She invites Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle M.G. When they get there, it becomes clear that M.G. want to take Indri's virginity. M. G. run a kind of prostitution house, and he either has the responsibility for a corrupt branch of the military or runs a paramilitary outfit, or prefers his guards to wear military uniforms. <br /> <br /> The women who deny him or otherwise make trouble are put in prison. Indri is sent there. The women are being tortured and sometimes raped by the guards. <br /> <br /> Various unsuccessful attempts to escape or rescue have been made but inevitably fail despite the obvious benefits the women have: they exceed the guards a lot and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons - most of them have semi-automatic rifles or small arms. <br /> <br /> WIP genre enthusiasts like it and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives it something new, but otherwise .. eh.
