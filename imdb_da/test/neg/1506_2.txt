This movie is so horrible, it's funny, not quite to Troll 2 levels of hilarity, but fun anyway. The action is horrible, the music is terrible and the story doesn't make a blind sense. The story is about a man dressed in a horrible granny costume that kills a lot of people at a party. The death scene is so poorly executed that they are fun. A girl is repeatedly stuck in her chest, but does not scream, try or defend herself or herself or run away. She also manages to remain standing despite being repeatedly repeated. Another death scene with a rope is also extremely fun. No thought seems to have been put in the plot. Granny seems to move magically from one area to another (eg, hiding under leaves in a forest area where the victim is just going to stand, appearing in front of someone, even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier), people kissing extremely inappropriate moments (would you stop and kiss someone if you were chased by a homicidal madman) and the double twist in the end is completely ridiculous, it seems they just threw it just to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this movie if they love horrible horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but don't see it if you expect a scary horror movie, you'll be disappointed
