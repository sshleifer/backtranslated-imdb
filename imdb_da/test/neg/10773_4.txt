I'm not entirely sure I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney a very calm, apparently lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be teeming with overwhelming energy and volatility. I didn't appreciate Houdini, James Bond, Mission Impossible style escaping Sir Percy also constructed. In the previous versions, the wit tool for escape, not technology. Neither were the Marguerite and Chauvelin characters adequately portrayed. There seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not want to blame anyone for the reason my reluctance to this movie may simply be a matter of difference in interpretation. Had the instructor's interpretation coincided with mine, perhaps I may not have been annoyed by what seemed to me bad character images. <br /> <br /> I much preferred the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was quite effective as an unstable, calm guy. It was also Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the style of this period seems to have been lost with this latest adaptation. I recommend sticking to the earlier versions, either from 1934 or from 1982. <br /> <br />
