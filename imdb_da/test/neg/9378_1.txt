August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the all-time greats, and I've been a fan of his since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I hadn't read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The movie surprised me a little. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to be ridiculous. In my opinion, it was not one of his better films, it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery. For me, this film was a waste of my time. I will continue to go to his movie and add his movie to my video collection. But I can't see wasting money to put this movie in my collection
