Then this ugly guy ends up with long, uncomfortable hair and his girlfriend in this house and they argue and argue for his old girlfriend. It was supposed to be something scary in it, but I didn't see anything scary at all. There is some mention of a demon from the sea, but it doesn't go anywhere. I wish it did because it would have taken the excitement away from the jealous love triangle. The title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie, but it's so far from it that I couldn't believe it. I waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did. It didn't live up to the title, as it should have so boo hoo hoo. The deck had a cool picture, but I should not judge a cheesy film by its cover.
