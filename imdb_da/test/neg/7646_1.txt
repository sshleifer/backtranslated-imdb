Apparently the movie has a hard anti-Bush message ... If it does (I didn't get it), that's all it is. It's boring and useless, period. It's too serious at times to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not fun, non-gripping, not exciting, not movie. It is all to be the opposite, and vice versa. I was amazed at how bad a movie could suck. Don't even think about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen literally hundreds of movies, and I've never been so obliged to write a warning on IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even "Making of ..." is painfully boring. It's just people talking gibberish with lots of inside jokes in front of the camera, like a home video. There is even a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set of movie staff. Still the movie I guess ...
