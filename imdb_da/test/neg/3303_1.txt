Above all, don't take this movie seriously. Unfortunately, it takes seriously, but it cannot help. This anime ninja flic must be the overall achievement in destroying what might have been an endearing if unoriginal, story of bad plot twists, ridiculous time-consuming cutscenes and an outrageous guest look that either makes you laugh or moan (or both, like me). While I'm typically a ninja / samurai anime fan (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin to name a few), this must be the exception. To the record, from a technical point of view to his time, this film was very animated and constructed. It's just the plot that stinks. The authors of this movie clearly decided (for what rational reason I do not know) that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway around the world is looking for a treasure that he (his) teaches Dad fought for and died for. In the process, he saves a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl living in a village of Apache, making friends with a ninja clan whose members are trying to kill him, encountering several family members when he knew he had it weird places and circumstances (and whoever later dies at some point in the movie). <br /> <br /> So far, these ridiculous phrases can be excused, but then they come to two "guest appearances". # 1: After a ridiculous cliche showdown with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain". At this point, you probably say "What is ****?" This "meeting" serves a purpose: it completely discusses a movie that tries to add a trained historical background to itself. I found it disappointing that the authors went to all this problem to investigate the 1860s USA and failed to realize that "Mark Twain's" real name was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it belonged to Captain Kidd. I can hear the pampering lusts now. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the running scenes. These scenes show different characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them for several minutes, and there are many of them. These are the scenes that make this movie 2 hours 12 minutes, which seems to last half an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitle movie that just asks for fun, this is it. Feel free to throw fun on every aspect of it and have fun. Just don't take it seriously. 3.10
