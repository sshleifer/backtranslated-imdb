Presumably, director William Shatner had thought of a much darker movie about 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier', but the passports at Paramount, looking at the huge receipts for receipts taken by his humourous predecessor Insisted on the new movie also has lots of laughs. So what we get is undoubtedly the weakest and coolest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are bad ideas aplenty along with a couple of good ones, and if you are in a charity mood, look at "The Final Frontier" in the same way as a television series of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best "guest stars" performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen placed right up there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half brother, consistently lifts the movie when it threatens to sink, which happens all too often. Charles Cooper is also good as the fat old Klingon General Korrd; Too bad is his role not as great as he is. If the story of Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology, for I was willing to blame the incessant silliness and non-persuasive action scenes at his directorial feet. The reason is that I've always felt that Shatner was the least capable of all the Trek regulars for everything that makes Star Trek work, and what makes it special to its fans. After reading his Trek memoirs, it is very obvious to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that has just happened with a science-fiction setting. He preferred Gene Coon's view of Gene Roddenberry's vision; Coon was known for his work on the popular Western series, 'The Wild Wild West'. Shatner also mentioned that a favorite Star Trek episode of his was 'A Piece of the Action', a silly second season episode, written by Coon. Then finally got the chance to lead a Star Trek movie, Shatner wouldn't follow his instincts and produce an action-packed flick with lots of heavy-in-kind humor? It did well, because that was what "The Final Frontier" ended up being. Shatner himself turns back to form like The Great Ham, and as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'wounds'. In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say what's worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godly dialogue. Running gags about equipment that has malfunctioning at the company has run from the 'Wrath of Khan' and thus the fifth Trek movie has entered the ground. Then have the idea of ​​a 'skeletal crew member'. A new development is a seemingly romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and it is enough to say that one does not exactly feel the flames of passion burning between the two. It is a meaningless subplot and adds nothing. The climate game where 'God' is encountered does not add much either; Whether this was a good idea at first is debatable, but the scene itself does not make much sense. (The ability of God's creators seems to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) About half of this is a tired retread of the climax of The Search for Spock. Leonard Nimoy manages to save Spock's integrity even though he spits such un-Spock-like lines as "Grab yourself, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as usual, surpasses both Shatner and Nimoy; He really came as an actor in the final Trek movie. So this Trek excursion is not terrible, it's just not very good. There was yet another original cast Trek movie before the relay was sent to the next generation, and it was far better suited to the task than 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.'
