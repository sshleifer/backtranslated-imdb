I've seen this movie 3 times. For the most part, because I continued to think while I was looking at it, "have I missed something here?" Is there any reason why this movie was made? Was it trying to say something and I just missed it? Well after 3 views, I didn't get an answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about any movie is that it bored me and I didn't finish it. I will admit that there are lots of eye lights and quick editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through, but is that all a movie should be? <br /> <br /> I'm not against extreme violence, it's almost non-stop, but it seems like there should be some kind of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by it. The word gratuitous comes to mind, but it is worse than that in some way. In the first part of the film we all get an insight into the characters' motivation. And yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely incredible. So in the first part we know the characters, and in the other part most of them die and use sadistic joy by killing others. It seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the other. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a good smart guy like Zed accept to join a lot of junkies and amateurs to do a job like this? It makes no sense. He is portrayed as smart, but he goes on with this suicide task. That he survives is completely incompatible with the rest of the violent violence and chaos. So what do we see here a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real super violent carnage? I remember having the same reaction to two other films that this instructor was involved in: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br /> Needless killing!
