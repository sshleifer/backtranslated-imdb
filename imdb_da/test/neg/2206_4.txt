This was a modest attempt at a movie, although it seemed more like a television pilot expanded. Some may find this unfair, but it seems that someone saw "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance" and thought "Hey, I could do that too." Well, not quite. Although I personally found the movie predictable, slightly poorly acted and constructed (beware of cookies), Carl Payne shows that he can carry a leading role and should be back on TV. The leading lady (can't remember her name, sorry) was also likely, but you're still thinking of Julia Stiles (she was the one in "Save the Last Dance", not?) Because this was really stuck in "white girl" condition.
