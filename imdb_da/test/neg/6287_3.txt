Bad old Robert Taylor. Except for FEDS, not much has happened - this almost shocking is a wasted ninety minutes and not much more. It's one of the cheesy detective-crime flicks with the story of the protagonist all the way through - it's usually reserved for comedies these days, but this movie is all too serious! A shame; Australian films, especially during the 2000-01 season, have been of exceptional quality in general - but I suppose there should be a few misses. Why even make a movie like this, of course it won't be good?
