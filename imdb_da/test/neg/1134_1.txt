Note, I only saw about the last half of this movie, so please feel free to take my review with whatever salt grain you find appropriate, as it was said to see what I saw was more than enough to make me totally convinced that a one-star rating for this is enough. In short, it is a blatant plot slaughter of the wonderful Christmas precursor (NL Christmas) with Chevy Chase, only it does not have the Chevy Chase in it, and it takes place in a generic tropical island that essentially has no connection at Christmas in general. <br /> <br /> Ol 'Chevy would probably not have because the plot is without real fun, instead they got the scruffy cousin Eddie who was again great in the original, but in this he is just above the top and an extremely bad foundation for any movie in view of the plot and play. The attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even modern television comedy trumps it, and considering that this should be comedy, I doubt that I should say more. <br /> <br /> This is not to be seen for its qualities, for it has none, but for it is wrong and, again, how Hollywood wastes it is the blood of life from the past in search of a quick buck. <br /> <br /> I think I will see the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence, from a lost time where movie pictures were more than just high budget, but thoughtless, garbage.
