Perhaps a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of life, but it is still a way of living. But after watching this movie, one can get away with believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, perceived, paper amplifier living solely to attend his next lunch break. Not exactly a beautiful picture, but this is the image that the audience must endure when you see what is no more than another boring, noisy, excessive action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these films has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these films is then embedded in the dust that today must be completely unrecognizable. The sites are changing, but the drawings remain the same, and with the same superficial character development and equally superficial appearance as educated artists are asked to transform into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to jump on each other. "When does this movie end?" I was thinking about myself repeatedly. Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely incredible as a CIA operative, but what should be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe playing a CIA bureaucrat. Be aware that in this movie, the on-site operative is "skinny and noticeable" while his desk jockey supervisor is bold. This is called stereotyping. What did the casting director think? Why didn't Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman plays a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so great that no literary license could give it credibility. An overtly non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) is trying to transfer as an Arab ... speaks fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain arrangements that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are totally incomplete by his ridiculous Arab masquerade ... trying to romanticize a Palestinian woman while standing in the midst of performing a very sensitive and complex espionage task ... etc. Now you get points. Next time you try to throw a real Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe it all. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this movie, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie - DVD country and oblivion. And another thing. Don't let this movie keep you from working for the government. The pay cannot be great, but the perks are excellent, a critical fact that this film is conveniently omitted.
