I saw this movie exclusively for the setting. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of. The plot was predictable, the play was at best, the scares were all rough-outs, not true scary. <br /> <br /> I can't remember much of the plot and I think it's because there was nothing much to remember. They didn't even use the hotel to the full potential ... Beaches are amazing and the hotel is on a peninsula. At low tide you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually a creepy sight first thing in the morning or late at night, when the wind shouts through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is with the remote control in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and I use this phrase loosely) scenes and pause in the beauty of the surroundings!
