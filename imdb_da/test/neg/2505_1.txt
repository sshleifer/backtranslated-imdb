Firstly, I even refuse to consider this work a music video ... I consider it a short film using excerpts from the song "Thriller" in the soundtrack. For me, a music video must not be longer than the song itself, and the song must play the entire length of the video. Calling this a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. On top of this ... let's see ... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely dated werewolf transformation, the thoughtless Vincent Price poem (just because VP recites it doesn't mean it's not boring) and the least threatening zombies I've ever seen. Sure, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but forget it, it also happened that the A-Team was the # 1 show on TV, so let's not give the culture too much credit on one. One last point on the movie's impact on the media on music videos ... what has this added to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" not already added? From what I can tell, it just added to stopping the song for a dialogue or a superfluous dance scene ... so you could say that this whole video really did was give Puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos ... Not quite my definition of great
