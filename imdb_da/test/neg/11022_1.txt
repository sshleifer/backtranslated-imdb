I start wondering after reading some of the statements here if I saw the same movie as the other reviewers, but after checking my facts, I am forced to the sad conclusion I have. <br /> <br /> This fuzzy wannabee screwball comedy should be one of the longest 94 minutes I've used, and one of the most unfunny things I've seen for years. Now, don't confuse me, I love scrubbing companies, but this dull, bottom-bound drop falls so far below the dizzying heights of Preston Sturges and Howard's Hawks that it doesn't deserve (to blend my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as the great . Author / Director Charles Martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle nor interesting - and so much of it. He also doesn't know how to finish a scene with some ruthless cutting, especially for people who leave rooms and goodbye to each other, the pace of the movie would have been lifted and saw the fact that the limited number of characters do stupid and ruthless things without Another reason than this should be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. Characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, moving in and out of the apartments, with a moment's notice only to move the little plot ahead. For a moment people are trying desperately to want someone, the next they get married to someone else - have been wild and wooed off screen, so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us - "Oh, they married itself! "(usually after someone has made a faux-pass or jumped to the wrong conclusion). If we had known that these two characters were in love or had to be involved before the hand, we, the audience, could have had the experience of seeing someone who fooled themselves before them. As it is, the characters just come across resembling selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action limited to them in a way that makes it all look like a poorly filmed scene game. The only moments of relief from the tedium are Keenan Wynn, who looks like he has walked in from another movie and has decided to hang around and be a little more fun than all the evil things going on around him. <br /> <br /> Very avoidable.
