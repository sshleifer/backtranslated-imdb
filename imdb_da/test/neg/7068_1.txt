This movie has no heart and no soul; It is an attempt to inflate a cult movie out of leavings by other, better directors, mostly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads a kind of rotten visual style and fills the street with raw and garbage, he makes a statement. But it's not a statement of anything - except for the director's shriek of "HEY LOOK AT ME! I'm an artist too." But he doesn't have an artist's imagination, just a good memory for things that worked - like some actors caught in this - for other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a tedious, boring task to sit through.
