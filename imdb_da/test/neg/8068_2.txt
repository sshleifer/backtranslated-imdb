so if a guy meets you and he says 'I want you to look at my erection!' Don't be alarmed, maybe he'll have you look at the movie he made about how to build his house. Yes! That's the only thing that happens in this movie! It's like the worst Warholske BEEP I've ever seen! It's like filming the inside of your toilet before flushing it. In fact, it is less interesting to look at than that. <br /> <br /> But if you see Lennon's Erection, he is warned that he puts a lot of background noise in it too. I really mean it is as if the building is being attacked by rummutants from hell or something! Meanwhile, the ongoing building grows as an erection can also do (for almost 20 minutes, what a performance). <br /> <br /> So if anyone asks you to see his erection, be sure he wants to videotape everything.
