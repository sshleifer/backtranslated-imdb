As "The Blair Witch Project" before it has "Hatchet" received its own fair share of bottom-to-front advertising (as an avid reader of Fangoria Magazine, the side ads are hard to miss); Even after the middle theatrical race, the film is bound to reside only on the hype surrounding it, and will probably become a cult object at some point. With a MySpace URL and a mighty (whose amazingly subjective) promise to preserve the so-called "old school American horror", "Hatchet" will draw many curiosity seekers with its DVD release (where this claim is emblazoned on the disc itself). Perhaps it was the big printblurb from Is not It Cool News on the ads that made me approach the movie a bit trembling (it seems that Harry Knowles and his minions will approve any movie for VIP passes and free food ), but "Hatchet" causes me the question of which author-director Adam Green's idea of ​​"old school American horror" really is: Based on evidence here it means the innocent, late 80's rip-offs of "Friday the 13th "and" Deliverance ". The characters are unpleasant stereotypes (black Chris Tucker type, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite Old Couple, Asian Tour Guide) whose interactions are horrified by painful dialogues trying to be in the hip, and mostly obvious staff on humor (not quite as bad as "Cabin Fever" but still); The script has too much padding (for example, the "rustling shrub" scene) and "Hatchet" wins as typical as any post-modern slasher in the last decade, with its only distinguishing feature being an expertly-calculated hype machine. I will give it a faint praise for gore - if you can wade through the padding between kills, the red vino is definitely a downfall and the only real reason to see this.
