This is one of those movies that is so bad, it's great !!! It has everything an early foursome movie needs: Flared pants, Big Mustaches, Chicks with Farrah Hair, and most importantly, NINJAS !!!! I have a few choices to recover for you. Cole's roommate has an oddly absurd face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. He gets his ass handed over to him about any other scene of the tears that wants his country so he becomes full of the whole movie. At one point his farm workers finally return after being driven by gangster guy's hired goons and Frank, I think his name is Frank, so moved, he shouts to the whole group "Lets Have A Cock Fight !!" and they all look forward to the chicken battle area to start the celebrations. This is fun at all levels. Whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart. Another fun thing is Sho Kosugi's little grunts and over animated ninja style movements. I remember this guy when I was a kid, and he used to say he was the world's only real ninja (he had commercials in martial arts magazine) if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and I remember seeing it in the local theater many times. I wondered that I saw this at Starz last night, why every American gangster type always has a stronghold in Phillipines and wears a white Steve Martin suit. In fact, this guy goes far beyond that in demanding all his thugs to wear white Steve Martin suits. There is a scene where it looks like 20 Steve Martin imitators are attacking a 1970s Sears underwear model (Cole). When we get to the last match, Cole breaks very clumsy into the evil lighthouse headquarters and is immediately seen by a secretary who again warns a guard who is burning a round from his pumping action shotgun not 30 meters from the evil and none seems to notice or care. Cole, wearing an all-white ninja outfit, continues to slam a staircase and then flips right into the area where all the evil ones are. The other responsible tells him that he did not have to kill everyone as they expected him, so give him a trip to the evil giant fighting game. Don't ask me why Cock Fighting is a big part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole still carries his ninja mask, though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it. The final battle is approaching as Cole has killed everyone and now Sho, whom I would like to call him, proves to have kidnapped Cole's lady aka Frank's wife, and they meet in the funniest cockfighting arena you've ever seen. Sho so very polite I can add, release the lady and the fight is about to start. They do their bend and begin to circulate each other, both masked off the road. When they compete, Cole appears to be another intermittent ala "Finishing The Game", a fun spear to complete Bruce Lee's "Game of Death". Cole finally reaches the top, Kills Sho, who dies with honor by being beheaded and all is well. Then we see Cole, after destruction everyone's life is splitting the city again, but not before foreshadowing a fat guy with a hand in his hand, and then he inexplicably blinks on the camera, freezing the frame, credits that are finished.
