The bipolarity of this movie is lunatic. For a moment, it is fun for Hispanics, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other it will touch with burnt villages and orphans. Even the serious revolutionary hero becomes a parody of a revolutionary at some point. But comedy parts aren't even fun because it's so clearly stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "deer" is basically a villain with a heart of gold. Add to these stereotypical sound effects, Latinos who speak English with each other, and a villain who just disappears from the story. And what's the point? It is fundamental revolution propaganda without resolution, and no planning (because there is just no way these people can lead a country). The US government is bad guys, but who wants to make money from this? Not some poor farmers, that's for sure.
