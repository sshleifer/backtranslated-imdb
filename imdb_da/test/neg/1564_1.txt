Cultural Vandalism Is the new Hallmark production of Gulliver's Travels an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. A single copy of the book is not burned. But if this is the only Gulliver people are exposed to ?? and for many it will be? These people will not get anything that Jonathan Swift intended. If Jonathan Swift lived, Hallmark could be sued for violations of moral rights and they would lose. It's a great way to think before you start a project using other people's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary view of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel great, small, shat on and ?? human. The small people in Lilleput are small in every way. Small and stupid, the giants, the big end and the little ones, endless wars of extinction, over which end their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table. Sounds a little like us. <br /> <br /> I forget most of the rest: It's been years since I read it. The TV show reminded me of a few things, and on the bright side it made me want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift for mankind has been shat on, like the Gulligan under the boughs under the vulgar yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be shamed thoroughly. Some "Creative Person" got the bright idea to focus on "the star:" Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose play is simply bad. He portrays Gulliver as crazy. All his travels were settled. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift made Gulliver! Of course, the countries he visited were imaginary: it is called fiction. His purpose was to talk about humanity and our often horrible relationship with one another. The travels of his imaginary character to imaginary countries are his method. But these people treat imagination as a disease, and anyone who has a moment that Hallmark could not turn into one of his anodyne cards is suspected. <br /> <br /> I can definitely see why Hallmark would produce this crap. It is so bad that O'Toole, always deep, seems as small as his lilliputic character. Of course, he is, of course, at the same time commenting on the character at the same time, so many if not all great actors do so. Informing the character throws the light on it. Our light completes the grade. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of mental triangulation. Most actors do this very subtly, like Hopkins in "Remains of the Day". Others, like Nicholson, have in most things over the last twenty years played the two parts quite broadly apart. Nicholson actually plays the relationship between his two points and with us too: with him it is the whole cat's cradle, and he chuckles away, keeps all the strings. Fun, as is O'Toole. But something is missing here. He shouts into a megaphone (as big as ever), and all senses are a hollow hole beneath him. <br /> <br /> That's because it is. Look up "anodyne" and there should be the word "Hallmark" as a synonym. Unfortunate, bland, unofficial: Hallmark is the doll that cannot pee because she has no genitals: it is the norm, the average, the person without difference. Hallmark's characteristics are to have no characteristics. I never suspect that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much. Suddenly, the pound's "Disney against meta-physicals" is in bold. Or Einstein's "Genius men will always be fiercely opposed by mediocre minds." In fact, anyone of this mediocre type who has an answer to a question other than "a" or "b" is suspected. Who more distinctive than the one who travels to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? The action of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are, of course, vandalism. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our own culture; who feeds and maintains them. And us. <br /> <br /> Buy a copy of Gulliver's Travels wherever you live and read it. Or book it online. I like using ABE Books.
