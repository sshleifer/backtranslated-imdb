I expected this to be fun and it was mediocre at best, the only fun thing is, believe it or not Andy Dick. The timing was just awful at most jokes and gags and the writing was bad, I think I know it should be like blaxploitation, but it just worked. Besides this whole genre has already been killed with all the austin power films and the undercover brother, it just seems old, it also feels just like a rip off from undercover brother (who was also not hysterical but much more fun than this). Also for a comedy / action movie the direction was kind of gentle. I don't know if it's going to be released in theaters, but it's definatley made for television.
