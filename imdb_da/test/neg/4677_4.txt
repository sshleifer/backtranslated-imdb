File this in 'How to get movies like this?' column. A fifty-draw indie version of `Macbeth 'is faithfully adapted (but meaningless) in a conventionally unconventional black-comic style. The cast gives it a shot, with Christopher Walken calling in eccentricity like McDuff, and with Maura Tierney rising over the boring script like Pat McBeth. The other players are wasted, just like the audience's time. Knee-jerk fans of this brand quirk like it, though. 4 out of 10
