Okay enough already. This is a terrible piece of TV. The camera's work is horrible (should I remind you of the crushed gravel so high you can hardly hear the actors speak) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the whole world. anna massey is 'acting' in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond. also bertram girls are not beautiful enough and the guy playing henry crawford is horrible. To say the camera's work is risky is an understatement. I saw this adaptation over Christmas, and I believe in other circumstances that I would not have been able to endure this, and certainly would not have been able to justify the wasted time. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of faith toward Jane adaptations. so I couldn't carry the movie adaptation or the latest pride and prejudice movie. But see any other customization instead, even Emma is better than this.
