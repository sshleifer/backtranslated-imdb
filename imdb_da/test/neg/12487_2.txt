A remake can succeed. An adaptation can succeed. It is not relevant whether it is a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a great movie, and a bad movie is a bad movie, regardless. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid a sarkar was a very bad movie. First of all, by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they do not bring about an aura about them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in the aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'goodwill' of the sign? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This case was said by a commentator, and Amitabh continued to give facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but why should that matter if there is no story or story to go with. <br /> <br /> There was no proper charcterization of the signs that worked under 'sarcos'. Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he's smart. ] The stream of the movie was generally boring because scenes from the godfather were created (as the policeman beat Abhishek Bacchan), the older brother was killed by Abhishek (which Fredo was killed on instructions from Pacino), but too much was being sought to be packed into the movie with too little history and depth to go with it. That was actually the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hour intricate details like a godfather in 2 hours, and with few dialogues what you get is a highlight of a cricket match, never getting the full effect to see a full match will do.
