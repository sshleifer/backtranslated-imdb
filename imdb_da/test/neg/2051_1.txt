Bled starts as a young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham) & they end up again at her studio where he gives her the bark of some kind of wood used as hallucinogenic fabric when melted down. Sai is quickly joined as she is whisked into an alternative fantasy reality involving vampire creatures. Sai's photographer Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic) becomes worried about her as she progresses from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug, Royce can kick her with the fabric or it will ruin her life and why the mysterious Renfield got her addicted to things in the first place & does the elaborate fantasy dream that tours have any meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson this anemic arty Vampire flick is basically 95 minutes of tedium and is consistently deserving of all the bad comments. The script was written by the interestingly named Sxv'leithan Essex (how in hell do you even pronounce it?) Which is also credited as a production designer and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in Bled, I would guess the decision makers set up making a very serious fantasy-based horror movie with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug abuse and rape drugs on the core. Most of the film has been used on the drug problem with Sai's first introduction to the drug, how big it was for the first time and how she becomes hopelessly addicted, eventually destroying her, living her life and her friends. It is never explained where she continues to get this drug off when Renfield only gives her a little during their first meeting, but hey, who cares? The first 20 eight minutes of Bled are really boring and boring, the following hour or so is not much better before a mess in a last ten minutes involving a Vampiric monster and Renfield who make a new appearance. The moral elements are condescending, the fantasy elements seem like a reflection and horror is nonexistent. There is also the dialogue that is horrible, every sentence trying to be deep, has lots of hidden depth and just trying to have so much importance that it becomes tiring to listen to. <br /> <br /> The film's concept is horrible & so is the performance, as there is absolutely no gore or violence to speak of & the whole thing is put into an apartment that doesn't seem to have any light. Fantasy setting looks a little better, but it is scarce and underutilized. There is no scare here, no atmosphere and to make matters even worse, decision makers have decided to use muted very faded colors that I just hate and find annoying, what's wrong with a nice colorful picture? It seems to me to be a fad with the current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a movie cool or adds atmosphere that it certainly does not, more often than not, just makes your movie look dull and kill as shown here with Bled. <br /> <br /> This probably had a low budget and was shot in Los Angeles and it has reasonable production values, but it's so boring. The action did not impress me, I didn't care or anyone who is never a good sign. <br /> <br /> Bled is a horrible vampire movie that goes to psychological horror as well as physically with all sorts of parallels to real life dug addiction and what it can do too little or no effect because it's all so boring . There may be an audience for a movie like this, but given the other comments, not so great one.
