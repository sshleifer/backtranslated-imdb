That's what I kept asking myself during the many battles, screaming battles, swords and general chaos that pervade the 84 minutes. The comparisons also stand up when one thinks of the one-dimensional characters that have so little depth that it is almost impossible to care about what is happening to them. They are just poorly written cyphere for the director to hang on to his multicultural beliefs, a topic that has been much better done in other dramas on both the television and the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I'm not really one to spot bad performances during a movie, but it must be said that Nichola Burley (as the heroine's finest best friend) and Wasim Zakir (like the evil, bullying brother) was absolutely horrible. I don't know what play they took off, but if I were them, I would apply for full refund after rush. Only Samina Awan, in the main, is able to impress in a cast of so-called British talent, which we will never hear from again. At least that's hoped. Next time, face another scout. <br /> <br /> Another exciting idea is the incredibly fashionable soundtrack featuring Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now I'm a bit of a music fan and I'm familiar with most of these artists' outputs, but I didn't recognize any of the tracks under this movie (except for the ubiquitous "Run"). B-pages, anyone? We get many, many musical montages that telegraph how we suppose to feel. These are accompanied by such disgusting original images as couples who kiss by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways. This is a problem as none of the songs conveys the mood effectively, and we realize that the instructor lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through narration and dialogue alone. The end is presumably supposed to be just desserts, since everyone gets their come and there is at least one big shock in the store. But I remained resolutely untouched because the script had given me no one to fight for. It is not enough to tackle a hot-button problem, you actually have to give us a plot that has not already been done to death and people who are more than the dressing window. As it stands, this movie is a noble fiasco, with only the promising leading actress and a few mildly derivative punch-ups to save it from the box. 10.4. Must try harder ..
