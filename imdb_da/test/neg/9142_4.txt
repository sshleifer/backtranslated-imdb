What a disappointment! I have enjoyed Jon Cleary's books on Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and the cinematic Malone. In the books, he is a city detective who is devoted to his wife and does not involve himself in fatal injuries. For the film, the character has been spiced into an outback copper that uses its fists and is not fond of jumping to bed with a beautiful girl, although what she and the other sex interests of the movie look in him, I do not know; Taylor was 39 at that time and his face was pushed. <br /> <br /> But his character is distinction remarkable; he flies in from Australia, apparently goes straight to the commissioner's house (rather trying to arrest him during a black tie reception), rescues him from murder (goes into a fight in the process), goes to a casino with a girl, leaves with another and takes her to bed. So much for jet lag! On his way back to the Commissioner's house (showing a good knowledge of London's back streets), he is struck by the evil ones, but is still down for breakfast! It is also noteworthy that the Commissioner's limo has miraculously repaired its windscreen and headlights within minutes of the attempted murder and that one sign has a moving belief in the precise timing of an inactivated bomb. <br /> <br /> The best thing is Joseph Butler's contempt for the creepy Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London trip, although some scenes take place during Wimbledon Tennis Week.
