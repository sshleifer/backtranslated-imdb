I had seen this as a kid, but I wasn't much of a Jerry Lewis fan, I had completely forgotten it (not in any way memorable). The movie is about impersonation (which seems to be in every cartoon star!) - in this case a German officer - and it's not as classic that it's not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding a BOMB rating) . either - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), although it is comparatively narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the wild mighty General offer more happy than the rather forced humor at the Nazi expense! <br /> <br /> The movie was truly Lewis's last gasp during his booming time; In fact, this turned out to be his last vehicle released for 10 years (it is painfully clear here that his particular brand of foolishness would not pass the pattern of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen's age)!
