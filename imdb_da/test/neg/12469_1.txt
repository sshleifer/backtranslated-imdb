Basic structure of a story: Beginning, Middle, End. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure plays with, and we get Memento or Irreversible, and the story plays backwards. Sometimes it's just not linear, a la Pulp Fiction. Regardless, they all have a beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I have ever seen that is not an end. Beginning: The girl's best friend has been expelled. <br /> <br /> Medium: Girl needs to get along without the best friend. End: Non existent. Not having an end would have saved this movie, but at least it would have been complete. <br /> <br /> It is an exercise in apathy; We get a party mix of characters, and they all turn out to be duds. Drilling, forgetting, stupid and easy imitations of people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action in this movie: NO HAPPY. Nothing happens at all. Mischa Barton is trying to talk to a nasty English accent, Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow from some old guys. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> As the credits rolled, I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners have to notice: time periods, the precious minutes of our lives have just been wasted. <br /> <br /> The only passable point (and it's only very emphatic) is Brad Renfro. He works well. Lacey Chabert I tend to suffer, but not lucky here. Because of the good work done in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty, but I hope that all cast members were hit in the face for their engagement. <br /> <br /> Please ask. Avoid. Don't be fooled into thinking about "I want to make my own mind". My sister never told me to see this, and I ignored her and wanted to make my own mind. It was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie. There are many I do not like, but I never hated a movie. Until I saw this.
