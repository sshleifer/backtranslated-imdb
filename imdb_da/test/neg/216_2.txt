How do you take a caste of experienced, well-known actors and put together such a silly movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six colleagues in a hooded car company decide to steal a large shipment in cash themselves. But just as they are the first base with their plans, it becomes completely untouched quickly. With a plot like this, you think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. But in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appears to be 6 normal, everyday kinds of guys. They laugh, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then we suddenly learn that they plan to steal their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he is a decorated veteran, good guy and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! So in the last 40 minutes of the movie, these former ordinary guys are almost all into money-crazy psychosis, willing to slaughter each other for money. In the last scenes, Mike (Matt Dillon) goes on a suicide campaign for no other reason than killing his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ends that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's amazing, and "B movie" is almost too friendly for this kind of cheesy plot. I would say don't waste your time - too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before they made this picture.
