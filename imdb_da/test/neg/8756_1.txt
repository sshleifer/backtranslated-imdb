A majority of only low-budget budget budgets from the 80s always stink, worse than resting old socks. This particularly stupid and amusing, non-budget Chicago-negotiated basement "nasty necrophiliac nutcase on the loose" carnage serves as a depressing confirmation of this border conflict. A beard, creepy, long-haired, pearl and blouse-wearing wild boar psycho-hippie cake stretches on your standard random cruel killing spree, graphically slaughtering Libidian young couples engaging in strenuous coitus when falsified Mansonesque lunatic attacks. (Hmm, do I discover a fairly overt and self-righteous Puritan "having sex and dying" message here? Gee, could be man.) Boy, is this mentally unbalanced sicko a great way, puppy: Having knife his female victims, our Certified biscuits killer enjoys loving their freshly bitten bodies. (WARNING: Possible * SPOILER * front. At the end of the picture, the corps copulating brag is rudely interrupted by the police while in the midst of making it unthinkable with a nubile carcass and thereby provoking the incurable pervert to cut loose with a understandably horrified and ear-splitting cry of "Nooo!") Now isn't this gonzo guy a particular girlfriend and a half? <br /> <br /> Too bad this flick is so poorly finished; If it had only been made with a modicum of flair and skill, it could have been an insidious little gem of terrible exploitation. Alas, Wally Koz's skin-fisted direction, Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth's stubborn static and immobile cinematography, Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez's unobtrusive, monotonous headband "hard rock" score, the pitifully cheap and inconsistent makeup f / x, flat, eye-catching unpleasant plywood, which appears by a disgusting all-thumbs and unappealing non-pro cast, lethargic pacing (too much screen time is killed wasted on police killing effort to catch wacko), a particular lame would be shocking "surprise" that ended (mystery the killer's true identity is guaranteed to make you moan in disgust, the uniform boring, incessant bickering and positive braindead characters and a steady array of boring soft sex scenes that are about as erotic as seeing two 90-minute snail comrades all Add up to a deeply worn and unrewarding limp, soggy noodle of a crummy clinker. But to be fair, this movie has a great virtue: The crazy dog's slasher has undoubtedly excellent taste in sparkling tropical, higher than thunder-day Hawaiian shirts.
