PERHAPS SPOILER !! Now I've seen it at the Cologne Film Festival and I have to say it's ridiculous ... sorry author and author and ... whatever but it's the worst attempt to make a good movie I've ever seen ... if you have 5000 times the opportunity to get away from your enemy and you do not .... it gets boring ... there are szenes in the movie witch giving you the impression that they are forgotten a szene in front of a security camera they are asking help and someone sees it and calls the police ... than there is a cut and .... NO ??? !!! ... the killer gets a shot in the head and 50 seconds later he behaves like nothing happened ... no it's no zombie movie ... and finally the final ... the big end that we were promised .... hmmmm , let's say take a little guy who would always give the world one of the best conclusions in history so bad that everything goes wrong .... I don't want to vote "1" because the actor is beautiful ...;)
