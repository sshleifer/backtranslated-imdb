** May contain spoilers ** Terrible. Just awful. I loved Stephen King's novel and it's just a horrible adaptation of it. They change the end. They change the plot. They changed Alan Pangborn's character from a grieving man to a happy fiance. If you are a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you are not, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was awesomely dark, even for Steve King. An 11-year-old kills himself in the novel. A middle school president is found with child pornography in the novel. It's not as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my least favorite movie all the time. I hate this movie with revenge.
