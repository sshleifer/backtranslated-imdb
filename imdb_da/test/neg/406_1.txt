I chose this because I had spent time in the Albany region of New York, I knew a few people in the movie and I happened to know it. The comedy trials are paralyzed, the obligatory girl-girl scene is sick, the plot is non-existent, the play is among the worst I've ever seen, and doesn't even make me start with special effects. I realize this is a very low budget movie made by a small independent company, but if you are going to make a sci-fi horror flick with giant bugs, don't make the giant bugs absolutely incredible. People want to see giant bugs. It's half fun right there. And if you want to make the gigantic bugs absolutely incredible, at least make the actors do some kind of heavy-in-kind connection to the fact ("You idiots! It's not them! You've captured their stunt double! "). Be prepared to waste two hours in your life that you will never be able to come back.
