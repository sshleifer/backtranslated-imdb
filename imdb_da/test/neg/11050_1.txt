This movie was horrible, clean and simple. It will probably be judged by those who only see "movies" and not "movies" and will therefore be sorry for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this movie, but I'm sure enough in my intellect for to say it This boring, self-reinforcing and painfully drawn movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had received and coming out of the theater thinking that these reviews should have been written by over-stretched film students and the aforementioned group of people who change ordinary movies, perhaps for fear that they can actually enjoy one day. The story is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, without knowing his prisoners or his crime. He is then released suddenly and given only five days to discover the identity and cause of the man who imprisoned him. However, the big concept soon turns into a pathetic joke, as Oh Dae-Su runs around beating people up and trying to get sex with a young girl trying to use the toilet and eating a living, angry squid (presumably for dramatic effect as there is no other reason for it). Still, he tries to figure out this horrible thing he did to serve himself fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds out, it is both ridiculous and a great disappointment. His nemesis, a man who apparently went to school with him when he was a young man, resembles a banana republic model 20 years younger than him. Hi, I know the prison has been hard on Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor who looks a little closer to his age? Of all the things that are wrong with this movie, this seems to be the easiest to fix. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one who kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been out productive - is a joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Come on! Throw us a leg here - was it really the best they could do? I sat through stupid dialogue, overbearing, gloomy sets and free violence for this? (By the way - I'm not at all against violence in a movie if it seems to fit the story, but in this case, it seems that I was forced to watch our hero, knock off the front teeth of others and cut off his own tuna with a few scissors to distract me from figuring out, I'm wasting my afternoon with a pretentious piece of waste). Take my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and see a little "movie" - one that you might actually enjoy.
