I was one of the many fools who were carved out to pay for this at the theater, even though I paid 4 bucks for matinee (before 18:00). <br /> <br /> Remake's history was high, the CGI Morlocks were paralyzed, Eloi was rastafarian to imitate today's fads (no I didn't think the chicken was hot at all), the re-emergence of the hero's modern boyfriend was something cruel, generally just a sad, poor remake. <br /> <br /> I'm taking Rod Taylor, Weena, and the cool glowing eyed surfer Morlocks over this junk anyway. My estimate is that many of the reviewers who like this horrible remake are young children who do not account for either good taste or true value of the old classics who are not much appreciated by today's confused and still more dormant youth. <br /> <br /> When the 60's version came out (I saw it first in the 70s for the summer fun) it was pretty amazing and still stops. You don't have to have an abundance of CGI in a movie for it to be better. Too much of this looks fake. I can't say enough of how disappointingly Morlocks looked and ran and jumped around as if they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10
