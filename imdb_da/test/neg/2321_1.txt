Absolutely inane movie starring Abbott and Costello. Even our young children will be increasingly annoyed with this complete mess in a movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Well, he had to be part of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that Costello's mother in the movie sounded like Fay Bainter? Fortunately, for Mrs Bainter, she wasn't in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really no excitement to hear for kids. The witnesses, if any, are quite outdated. Some of the song is nicely finished, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
