I must not have seen the same movie as the one that the comments refer to here. First of all, I think they should have serialized Ghost Story if they were to film it at all. The truncated version they come with was horrible. I felt the show was matured and so much was left out of the story that the notion of such gentlemen as Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks seemed hammy. Alice Krige, however, was fantastic as Eva. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was only sufficient as a protagonist. The decision to throw Patricia Neal and shorten her role was not a good one. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with that character! I blame the script, which was poor. The production values ​​were dark and pacing was slow. A disappointing, pedestrian effort. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the five largest suspensions / horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the film was disappointing, although a great introduction to Krige.
