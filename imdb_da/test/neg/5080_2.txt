By seeing the names of the starring actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe), I thought the movie should at least be decent or interesting. Instead, everything I got from it was not just boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was going to happen and hearing tons of lama and shabby "bad cop" phrases. The main problem is that the film doesn't have a good story to begin with. And when you do, no one can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes ... not even John McClane could save this movie :-) It could be cool for the kids if they are not over 12 years of age because they Don't care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie.
