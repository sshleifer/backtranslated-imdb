CUJO is a film adaptation of a novel by the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I've never read the novel, but just scanning the comment page has given me some insight. I have noticed a reference to the change at the end. The movie's plot is as follows - a St. Bernard dog is bitten by an amber bat and goes on a killing spree. <br /> <br /> The plot sounds pretty worn now, after being made into various movies. But it might have been something new when the wife wrote the novel. Or maybe King's novel put a twist on the story, which was never shown in the movie. In any case, the first 40 minutes of this movie has nothing else to say than the dog gets bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, no fun, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. I found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly yelling at the TV, "come on, get started!". The events that I saw on the screen are reminiscent of a television movie of the drama cleaner or an extended episode of a television soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the film given some focus, so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but it didn't get enough screen time in this section. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing tax later. <br /> <br /> After 40 minutes of ground, something happened. The dog was suddenly transformed from a lovable pet to a vicious killer. It began to attack some people. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse hunt when two characters were caught in a car, unable to leave, because the dog would attack them. Even in this far too long second half, the excitement would build up well before death again. It was just a stop-go situation repeated over and over until the movie reached its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without closing, I can tell you that it was very formal and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> The exciting scenes when on the screen are exciting to watch. Some large camera angles threaten the dog's evil nature when he attacks people. This is particularly important because, as others have mentioned, a St. Bernard dog, is not as near as scary as a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the movie fails to use exciting music to support the images on the screen. The music is far too melodramatic rather than exciting. This may suit a television movie, but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie that presents a live nightmare to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This brings me to a broader problem with this movie - photography. The camera work and especially the choice of colors make this seem like a very inexpensive TV movie you would expect to see as the daytime on Channel 5 here in England, where I write this comment. <br /> <br /> The two best actors provide good acting that helps breathe into the movie's boring segments. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should get credit for doing a good job with the bad stuff they get. I could forgive some brief moments of assault by putting more emphasis on the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. I don't want to give judgment on the other actors because they have almost nothing to do. <br /> <br /> As a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, both movie adaptations of famous Stephen King novels, I had high expectations for this movie. But it turned out to be a massive disappointment. Generally, I do not recommend Stephen King fans or horror movies in general to see CUJO. This is one of those moments where I recommend the book instead of the movie. Hopefully it brings the story to life in a way the movie couldn't do.
