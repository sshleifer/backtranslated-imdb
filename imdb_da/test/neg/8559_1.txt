I've spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and recently find myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real shame because I like these people, I just can't believe anyone could possibly do something like that bad like this? !!!! This was bad from any angle. From camera work to dialogue to acting on costumes and production design was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in this movie looked as if they had been taken straight out of a porn shot in the San Fernando Valley and put on a set of even less talented crew. <br /> <br /> I just can't get over the fact that I'm sitting on some of the best materials I've ever read, and contacts in the industry that could help me make my dream come true and have hit every roadway possible? But the folks behind this play of a movie have no trouble putting it together and actually sleeping well after it's released. Life, what a trip!
