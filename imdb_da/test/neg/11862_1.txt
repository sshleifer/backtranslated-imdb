Let me first emphasize that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even though it makes jokes out of minorities. The reason why I am absolutely certain that this racist work is not worth seeing is that it does not make fun of minorities to demonstrate their living conditions, social conditions or the way they are treated by society. In addition, it uses any stupid stereotype and prejudice to strengthen xenophobic feelings and reservations. It's really a shame but not a surprise that the other comments didn't get the point because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
