Concept: Show 4 families of diverse ethnic groups in the Fairfax District of L.A., preparing family for gatherings at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and how to make an American quilt {I think there is a law that Alfre Woodard must be in all these movies) who also offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a treat. Instead, I felt fooled. They are busy out about 40+ characters, and anything but two are single-class cliches without any sort of subtlety. Writers and instructors should spend a few years learning about life and learning how loving people from different generations are actually connected. Instead, you have a bunch of ** holes that come together in Turkey to act as extra obnoxious ** holes. Now it is to the extent that Thanksgiving is about. But not this misguidedly. And why bother having Julianne Marguiles, then give her absolutely nothing to do. This was a task to get through and Mercedes Ruehl is a standout, but I give it a 4/10.
