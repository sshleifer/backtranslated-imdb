I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In a kind of odd, surrealistic way, the comic caught the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America is engaging. I'm thinking now of how I burned a curly grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at that time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew "stoners". It was the children who carried the iron maiden t-shirts in school, grew their hair long, had immature mustache and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a class or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid, even if they were not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. To the extent that GenXers, like myself, would blow up the profits of the 1980s and embrace the ground movement in the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a strange postmodern hymn to us. Strange, because like Beavis & Co did not care if we had an anthem. It was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even though it was terrible.
