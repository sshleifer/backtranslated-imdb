This is an admirable attempt from the first time filmmaker Ham Tran, which offers a little eye-catcher that deals with Vietnam war victims fighting for liberation, but playing out as a glorious history story. With clunky, self-conscious informative dialogue and sub-par acting, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not come to an end this sagging, albeit historically worthy, melodrama. If you're not often distracting, the connections with the actors are interrupted by the reality of on-screen situations, and you should be left with an informative, somewhat impersonal, series of Vietnamese post-war history.
