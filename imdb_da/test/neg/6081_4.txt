As usual, manager Leo Gorcey (like Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are hard pressed for cash. After trying to sell their old jalopy, the boys look for help from the local bank. There Hapless Huntz Hall (like Sach) has taken his picture of the beautiful photographer Teala Loring (like Cathy Smith). But when the shot was caught during a robbery, it made Mr Hall look like the primary suspect. With friends Bobby Jordan (like Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (like Whitey) and David Gorcey (like Chuck); Mr. Gorcey will clear Hall and collect $ 1000 reward money. Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
