For those of you who have a few kind words for this movie, I suppose you didn't see it when it was released as "Parts: The Clonus Horror." <br /> <br /> It was a terribly dull movie. It missed the mark in at least three ways. It wasn't good enough to be scary; it was not bad enough to be fun (though MST3K took care of it); and even in 1979 the plot was unoriginal. Former challengers are the "Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as spare parts). The movie is entertaining and it had a nice cast. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Remember the flattened nose? And "clones" (1973). The last two plots are not the same as Clonus as the first, but they anticipate Clonus. <br /> <br /> They are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea, but often the word "clone" is not used.
