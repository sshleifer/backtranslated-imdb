This movie was a waste of time. It looks good, beautiful settings, nicely acted, looks serious and seems to be leading a place so you are tuned in pending a meaningful payout. It does not happen. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that so much effort could be put into a movie, it was clearly very professionally done and has a result that doesn't seem to be a b movie. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and watch a good French movie like Les Visiteurs (fun), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can't remember the language of Europe Europe, but it's another great movie - heavy but very worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to promise a lot but does not deliver.
