Cruddy, innocent .. no smoker, drinker or cyclist, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actor) make this moronically possible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew we knew it ... Adam Roarke and slate are wasted .. but they lived on. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the only one to catch the final biker movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (who also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They were trying to live. But Jocelyn Lane (from two Elvis bad flicks, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with J. Slate fighting for honor. It's worth seeing, but it sucks. But check it out. Worth being non-biker, non-smoking, non-boozing, "biker" types with hot chicks.
