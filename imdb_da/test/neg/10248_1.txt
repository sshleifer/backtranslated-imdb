For the connoisseurs of bad movies Galaxina is a real gem. With truly horrid dialogue, action and governance, it is no choice for people seeking a real movie. But as one of the most unintentional hilarious films in his genre, it is invaluable for a good laugh. Especially, the scenes involving Harley Davidson worshiping motorcycle cultures are particularly good, and many other scenes allow for a cheap laugh. Unfortunately, scenes with Dorothy Stratten fail to deliver, but since she plays an android, I assume you can excuse her for wood actors. <br /> <br /> Bad movie lovers, don't pass this up!
