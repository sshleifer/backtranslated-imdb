As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years, I found this movie very difficult to see. Too unreal. It seems that the producers of this movie had either done little or no research or just didn't care. The card tricks is something you would never see done in a real poker game. Sense sense? Plus it was full of movie cuts and the like under tricks. Who couldn't do that? The cheats were amateur issues. Palming, marked cards etc. Would you sit in a highly restricted game where they use open deck cards? Do you want to sit in a game where players push their chips into the middle of a pot (all the time), blending in then just verbalizing how much they bet? C'MON! I gave it a 4 because the twists may be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game it will be quite painful. Next time they will need real players and get an insight into how to do it right. OUCH!!!
