You see a movie titled 'battlespace', what are you thinking about? The room struggles with cool as high explosions and everyone shoots at each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get some space goodness, but in the vast majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around and doing almost nothing. No speech! What is this nonsense? We get narrators and a couple of British computers, but it's about it. The protagonist must be the worst I have ever seen as she doesn't even have any dialogue and sleeping even though scenes (literary!). Some of the things that happen are just stupid, as if they were using a rocket (like going to the room) for the basic transport plane side, why not just use one of these fancy spaceships? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with some boring, dull, lifeless tests, but the most important thing you will notice is the Atari sound effects that ships use ... you have to fool me. I can also say that the budget was low because everything looks fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool movie scene. I seriously think that the budget must have been in the double digits, it is so bad, so you laugh more than you should at how bad it is. I start to believe that they paid the actors based on how much dialogue they had because theirs are very small here (if you can't tell it, it's my main thing here, as I probably said it 3 times already).
