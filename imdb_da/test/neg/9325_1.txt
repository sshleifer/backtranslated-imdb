One of the worst movies I've ever seen! The "beginning" was not the greatest, but better than this. This is not a good way to look up to the original movie. It's just simply awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of movies is the movie and clothing that really caught the era well. I understand why this movie was redone as "The Beginning". It's just so bad, in my opinion. where does the money come to waste like this? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I'll show you how to do it!
