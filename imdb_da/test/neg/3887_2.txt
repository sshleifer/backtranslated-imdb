It was impossible to understand what the producers of this terrible adaptation were trying to do. <br /> <br /> A group of top-quality actors who are largely thrown away (with a few notable exceptions), give pretty good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and just as well is Joanna Lumley as Diana. Everyone is doing well with the scripts they were given. <br /> <br /> So much for the good. The average will include the sets. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although the bizarre house they use for Dower House looks remarkable like that. It is obvious that Dower House is far too big. In the later parts, the authors decided to bring the whole story back to Britain, presumably to save money, although with some imagination I doubt that they could have reclaimed Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now to the bad. The play. This is such a terrible bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in Britain's battle, but survives, blind. He makes a short look and commits suicide - why? Loveday has been changed from the young woman in love with Gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up with love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than short meeting). Gus, a man possessed and passionately in love, is willing to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a superficially outlawed man to a devoted family member. Jess is made for a psychologically disturbed young woman who will not speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drinking problem, but now without any reason. Dower House is occupied by the army with no apparent reason other than a very short scene with Jess having a fear of armed soldiers. While Miss Mortimer's breasts are quite lovely, I couldn't see how their screen on several occasions moved the plot forward. The lovely named Nettlebed becomes the secular Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in looking for this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow-up to the story. It's hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; she probably lost her control when the rights were purchased.
