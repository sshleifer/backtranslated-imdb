I was not impressed with the Graffiti artist, despite being artistic (aka low budget improvisation) appeal. There is little dialogue and at least for me I was disappointed that it did not provide more credit or promote guerrilla artists' work like these. Instead, it was a story that covers the known area. Two guys who make little more than roof buildings become friends, tagging partners, and eventually experimenting with a relationship. They act as opposites, rather unpleasant together. Slightly explained about their backgrounds, and things between the two young men happen at fast speed (though I can understand because it is only 70 minutes or so). There have been countless similar images and productions in recent years to the point that the self-film's sphere begins to become as saturated with this particular narrative story as the ordinary has become saturated with this and more. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie can drill the viewer who needs instant dialogue and purpose. The primary figure of this story (at least in detail) performs its routines with almost no dialogue, no insight, and nothing else to bear the viewer. And for a short film, I wanted them to have got a lot faster. That, apart from the typical plot, irritated me. Nevertheless, there was something about an instant insight into the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, although most of it was a little free time. Recommended if you are tired of the ordinary crap and don I don't mind an indie picture and have some interested in this underground urban art form. But you really have to see it yourself, because it seems to be one with a more acquired taste. For newer indie films focusing on graffiti artists, check out Transit.
