This movie is called by the protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain, and those who ignore it have blinds. One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if you accept this as true, the movie ends either A) by saying that there may be something good in tragic situations or B) forgets this and uses a clich√© montage to let the audience feel uplifted. <br /> <br /> The film metaphorically rejects its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite some evidence of the sympathy showing contempt for the supporting characters most convincing in the film. So what you have in this movie is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the end to sync with the rest of the movie. There are excellent performances given by each member of the cast, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It is a pity that they were not supported by a better writer / instructor.
