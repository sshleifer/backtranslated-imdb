Forced, cloying, formulaic. Do these adjectives do you want to run to rent his? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde." A few other early films from her, especially "The Temple of Temple Drake", never appear, but are said to be excellent. Here she is cutesy, bossy and thoroughly unappealing. Ray Milland as a bohemian in Greeniwch Village not convincing at all. <br /> <br /> The two child's performing artists are scary and have no relation to the village as it was then. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I find the ersatz, generic and fake option. Not that I was in a couple of generations, but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not fun. It is not externally authentic. We don't care about the characters. <br /> <br /> So many films were made about the fighting masses versus the capitalists at this time and done with elan. "Easy Living" comes to mind. It didn't take place in the village. But it rings very true. This rings with a crushing knee.
