This is a disgrace to the name of all the lovable and ridiculous Critters saga. Why do the authors feel the need to make the movie unbearable to follow all quality standards. Critics are sweet and adorable as always, but fatal behavior has been transformed into a killer baby. They are not so horrific, cruel, some what the spine-chilling and fun as they were portrayed in the movies before. I used to love their porcupine shots, but now it's hidden as if it were supposed to be repetitive and boring. And what about the killing and not eating. I thought this movie would have been cool, but everything was so wrong. Why should Ug be hurt and killed by what is called Charlie. This movie sings me. Disgrace! Disgrace! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
