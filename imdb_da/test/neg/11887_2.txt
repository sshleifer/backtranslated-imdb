Ham-handed tribute to honest hacking. Felt good on a soft core way similar to its mild pornography until the lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent. Basically, a muddled '90s remake of' 85's 'Real Genius', with fewer and stupid geniuses, and a cynical end, perhaps this movie will appeal to someone who is happy with the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy The fact that it is almost random, or perhaps for technical types who like to see themselves depicted as cool and sexy, speculate about the reasons why someone likes this movie is definitely more interesting than the movie itself. is more interesting than the movie itself.
