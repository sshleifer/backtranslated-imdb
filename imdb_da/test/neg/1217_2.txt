Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This came directly from the "Jaw's" cookie-cutter mold, with some other bizarre cliches being thrown in good measure. I was interested to see this after finding a quiet from it in a book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I think I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very slow and talky, much of this killer shark movie takes place on land, which is not so surprising. It seems that the only method they had to show a shark is through the shots of a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and it's too bad ... most of the characters are so annoying that you actually want them to be eaten. <br /> <br /> "The Plot" cares for a group of four children who meet a mysterious Indian on the beach one day while we praise weenies. For some reason the Indian gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to trace an old evil who took the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... presumably because they were too good at fishing the sea and the sea god was worried that they would take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> That's also a good thing, because you wouldn't know that ... years later, a monster shark appears and starts to gobble up people in the sleepy coastal community. When one of the four guys is eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the case ... especially since (big shocks here) the authorities have killed a shark, and they believe the threat is over. Yawn. The obligatory death scenes are incredibly boring and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while sitting in a van, so jumps out and says "I'm going for a swim", immediately gobbled up by the waiting shark). They had a lot of nerve to call this movie "Deep Blood" as you hardly see anything, just overcast water. The actors handle their clichÃ© roles as they are all thumbs, and there is even a fun subplot that involves a greasy rocker-type bad boy who threatens our goody-goody heroes, so it will be good at last to help kill the shark. /> <br /> It took me a long time to find this movie, it's pretty unclear, so I don't think there is a danger that many people are wasting their time on this. But if you were to entice it ... not to say you hadn't been warned!
