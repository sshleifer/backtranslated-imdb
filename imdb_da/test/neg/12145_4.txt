GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A boring western / comedy feature with Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this time, which I have always had as "third Stooge") makes their usual sktick and directed by it usually reliable Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts - so you have to wonder what went wrong this time? The most likely answer is that it worked quite well as a 15-minute two-reel comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short topics, GOLD RAIDERS are not worth revising. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
