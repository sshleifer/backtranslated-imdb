I was really looking forward to watching this movie, having spent a couple of (amazing) college weeks in Barcelona. The premise is just on the cue - a confused and disordered young person enters a world of equally confused and disordered young individuals. But the director's weak swats on symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely out of the mark and it leaves us, the audience, feeling confused and disordered. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if this movie was presented as a European "American Pie" flip, then I could turn off my brain and watch the ride. But just outside the bat, the instructor guides our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the inner self dichotomy vs. "public self" (one's mother tongue) against one's secondary language. In addition, it delves deep into the topic of racist / national stereotypes. Off to an interesting start, eh? <br /> <br /> WRONG. It is as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again, except for the perceived epilogue-type end, which seemed to be the director's way of flowing to get back on the subject. It reminded me of a meandering speech that does not go, but the speaker stops saying, "So the conclusion I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!" As other reviewers have also pointed out, the cynical jab by stereotyping betrays itself. If it is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking English-rolling beer pig as a prejudice caricature? Why does the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally paving his chest and making monkey sounds at some point) while Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl sinking to annihilate slurs (call French people "frogs" and butcher French language), while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this is not a deep or well thought out movie. It is simply an Anglophobe's retort for the anglophiles. But it really is no different than the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there's a fun irony to consider. <br /> <br /> OK, philosophy, artistic and socio-political commentary aside, I was still very sad about this movie. There is a very fun gag that involves deceiving one of the girls' lovers, but apart from that, I was almost not entertained. The only reason I saw it through to the end is that I want to brush up on my French and Spanish. (You can see we single Americans can be stupid, but we try.)
