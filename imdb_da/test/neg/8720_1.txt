This is a total piece of crap. It's an insult to the amazing book by Frank Herbert. They lacked the story and the characters. The action is average to poor. The only sign done right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in history, and then it is all downhill from there (not a very high hill to begin with). The 1984 film was directed by legendary David Lynch. I wasn't too impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. Amazingly, the crappy mini series makes it look much better in comparison. At least it was something true for the book that I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the chance to do it right this time, unfortunately it was not taken.
