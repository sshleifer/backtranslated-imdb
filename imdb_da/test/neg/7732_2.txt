My treasure, this movie was no more than movie making with numbers. Fighting salesman can't do it in New York, mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, battles the seller moves to California and makes it big, then loses it big, then jumps it back with the simple life then hit the bottom trying to get back to the top. I don't think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Case in point (spoiler?): When the John Kapelos character calls to say he and his girlfriend came to Santa Cruz to visit, and James Woods says there is almost no chance he would come, you knew with 100% confidence that they entered the next scene or two. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young certainly looked good.
