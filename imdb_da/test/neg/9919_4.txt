A historical story of a teenager who reacts to the church and her ministerial father in a small Norwegian village. The landscape setting is picturesque, but the story is quite pretentious and plodding, with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures. It's like watching a religious propaganda movie. Theisen, who has only made another film, is quite good as the sensitive young protagonist, like Sundquist as his strict father and Riise as a woman, Theisen is fascinated by. The film aims to be fresh and charming, but feels quite outdated and tired. Director and co-author Nesheim, who has worked most on television, is not up to the task.
