I don't know about you, but I'm going to horror movies to be scared and it was anything but scary, the movie had more options to be really scary and failed every single time! Several of these suspected exciting moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year, maybe decade! I mean, when I say that cg looks like daytime, I give the daytime a bad name, I've seen better things on the sci-fi channel. Who I really am sorry about is the actors (they have their names attached to this movie) they did a good job, I took care of most of the characters, and I felt their performances were quite good, but it was Not enough to take this movie out of the gutter. What is entertaining is the reuse of some of the sets if you have seen the "exorcist: the beginning", it will be easy to see the recycling of some of the buildings. But what I thought was the worst thing about this movie, even though the CG problems were the most important demon, he was just not scary yet his form, the way he spoke, was extremely sad. All in all, this movie was a horrible experience and I would have gone out of the theater if it wasn't for my wife who would see the end.
