Ugghhh !!! This is just the kind of Pre-Code movie that could wrongly convince the viewer that movies from that time period are miserable - and they are NOT - it's just that this movie is horrible. Awful because it is so hopelessly old-fashioned, boring and crooked that I was torn between laughing at the movie or just falling asleep, while the film is trying to be a lot of "hip" and "adult" This is a unique combination, for the most part. <br /> <br /> So why, I hated it so much? Now the movie is incredibly blurry but has no style, and the movie is supposed to shock, but lacks ease and takes too many ridiculous turns to be credible. The movie begins with a clich√© - a hooker with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and she seems to be killing a man by accident! Shortly after she relaxes, she meets an old girlfriend who insists on marrying her (he is not aware of her profession). When she sees this man's innate goodness, she decides to change her life and stop living the wild life. This is difficult when she hides on a fictitious Caribbean island. Here alone and waiting for her husband to return, there is nothing to do and the place is infected with super-chickens and totally unpleasant men. In fact, this part of the movie is so boring that the audience may find it hard to stay focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by the Mackaill's presence that they always seem to rape her - only to be rejected because she is no longer that kind of girl. Quite frankly, I was very tired of all those sweet scenes - there is simply too much eye rolling and tongue weaving to make it something other than a very bad movie. And looking at all these nasty horn dogs was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, it gets a lot worse. The man she believed she killed appears on this small island (what are the odds?!) And he also tries to rape her. But he should not be discouraged and she ends up shooting to save her newfound virtue. While the jury on the island is releasing her, she rushes back to court and lies - telling them she meant to kill the man and it was biased (?) Because even though she was acquitted, she knows that the evil prison will Have his way with her when she is sent to jail for a gun possession charge. When the prisoner even gave her the gun to put her up, she wove into court and said she was guilty, really worked, really stupid. Why didn't she tell them the dubious plan of the prison? Probably she did it to preserve her virtue, but to admit to killing someone so that people will believe you are a virgin?! So in order to avoid a brief prison sentence (and once again the threat of rape) she does not consider the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the prisoner has promised to rape her when she is unlocked). And just before she is taken to the gallows (to avoid the rape), her boyfriend shows her time to send him and the credits. <br /> <br /> Impossible situations and coincidences are largely - so often the movie is just stupid. Combining this with all the sexual induendo, this gives a bad and blurred mess in a movie that only appeals to the most deadly fans of Pre-Code movies. Everyone else, beware, this is very sticky and silly from start to finish!
