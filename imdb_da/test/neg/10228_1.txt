How many movies are there to be against any odds, a RAGTAG TEAM beats the big guys with all the money? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "The Big Green". If you want something, you will have them lost. Steve Guttenberg used to have a good CV ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did he have to make these kind of movies during the 1990s and beyond? So just avoid this movie. There are lots of good movies out there so there's no need to waste your time and money on this junk. It was clear that the "green" of their mind was money, because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever movies with Pixar.
