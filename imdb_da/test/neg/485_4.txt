This is better than the early Cronenberg horror movies, but no more than your basic, what-the-right story. The video game theme has been told before too. Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not so strong here) with the entertaining sexual references and Shore's dark score. The story never takes your full attention. It just flows to event after a boring pace event. Rating 4/10.
