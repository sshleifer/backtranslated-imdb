In the early 00's, production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre films in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" turned out to be hits, so more movies became green or rescued from their "direct to video "fate. But France, unlike the US, UK or Italy, has a small tradition of fantasy B movies, and it soon became apparent that "Samouraïs", "Bloody Mallory" or "Crimson Rivers" sequels were undue attempts to Recreate a kind of magic that had never existed in French cinema at first. As they flocked, the producers have returned to their usual fare: derived farces or the seventh self-referring tribute to French New Wave by a former critic of "Les Cahiers du cinéma". <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" could only have been green-lit under this short window as it does not serve any other visible purpose. It's your by-the-book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references, and you'll find bimboesque female characters, a French university resembling an American campus, and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you guessed it yourself an hour before even before the movie started. <br /> <br /> These items make all the fun of a 70's or 80's B movie and you expect them in a 70's or 80's movie. However, we are not in the 80s anymore, and no one warned director Doug Headline, as this tribute to the slasher film genre is nothing but a derived slasher film. The headline itself is not a beginner and has written as a critic of this kind of pictures since the early 80s, but as the first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "Brocéliande" a drilling. <br /> <br /> When composing clichés from a movie subgroup and sending them to a skilled and inventive instructor like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "Scream" or a "Death Proof" movie that is imitating from old guilty benefits, but also magnify these clichés and add them a lot. It's called "talent" and therefore you can't confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot many years ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes the lazy road and reproduces only the worst elements of previous movies (unfortunately for the male viewer lacks the free key most). There are very strong similarities (presumably unintentional) between the plot "Brocéliande" and the fake "Halloween 3: Season of the Witch", both of which deal with supernatural Druid evil rituals and some stupid attempt to take over the world on Halloween night. As it means, "Halloween 3" is more sensible than this, it means that something seriously wrong with "Brocéliande".
