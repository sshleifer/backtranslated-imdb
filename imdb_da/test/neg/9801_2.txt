In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to movie stardom thanks to her sultry beauty and her highly utilized "peekaboo" hairstyle. She stared opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March and scored screen success in movies like "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch". She also stayed with female stars, and she even surprised her critics with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in "So proud we salute". But changing times and her own failed interventions with her, and at the end of the decade, her greatness passed. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future), Veronica headed to New York City, where she occasionally made television shows and summer feet before falling out of sight. It was brief news when she was found working as a barmaid in another hotel in the early 60s. But now her long-standing alcoholism and years of hard life had robbed her of her appearance. Without them, the public's interest in her blew up again. She returned to the scene in various vehicles, but her success was minimal. Eventually she moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relatively hazy. In 1966, she went to Canada for a part in a fuzzy film called "Footsteps in the Snow" which had no American releases. The following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial function. They approached her to star in their movie "Time Is Terror" and convinced her to invest in the project. As an author, it stated: "If it ever suffered a movie queen, it was a terminal comedown, that was it". Surrounded by amateur artists and pathetic production values, it failed to rise to a minimal level in this Miami, Florida shot quickie. When you seemed to be common in long shots and lurking in close-ups, bad Veronica did not seem to go as much as going through her part. As a counterfeit doctor who has hit a successful youth creation formula, using meat-cutting spats! She looks both bored and confused, her most unintentional hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad lib while struggling to play a pair of rubber gloves. The support aid is not at all helpful, but merely promoting the plot by talking it to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently demanded that the actors should move while the camera was pointed at them, not necessary for something resembling entertainment (Admittedly, an unintentional hilarious scene with a private detective / nurse and a body in a wheelchair that Goes ahead of '' Weekend at Bernies '' by nearly 20 years.) According to Veronica himself, the film was hailing for three years because no championships were recorded. But in 1970, the production company scraped it together, changed the title to "Flesh Feast" and released it into cash on the lake's recently published biography. And because former ladies like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland unexpectedly revived their career in horror movies, this travesty was promoted as Veronica's "comeback movie". This seems to be a strange action for the filmmakers to pursue, because the (young) audience of a horror movie of this quality is not likely to know or care about who Veronica Lake was. As expected, it didn't matter to Veronica's career and she died in poverty three years later. A previous reviewer mentions a scene in which the female detective works as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory (monitors theft of bodies from a nearby gazebo) using the help of a majority driver to cut the body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighs, "I hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science." "Try not to think about it," advises the driver and misses away. "I think you're right, Hans." concludes detective / nurse, "What is done is done." What a sad end to the career of a still shy remembers the star.
