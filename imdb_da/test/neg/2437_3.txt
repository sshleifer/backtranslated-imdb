It's hard to tell who this movie is aimed at; The characterization and style tastes of a "Children's ITV" series crossed with an Aussie soap, but the subject, nudity and language are aimed at an older audience. <br /> <br /> The first half-hour, heroine Justine has philosophized about losing his virginity and is unnoticed embarrassingly for anyone over the age of 18. A complete rip-off of "Ferris Bueller", from the talking camera on the screen down to the graphics on the screen. <br /> Her nephew friend Chas brings her to a computer booth where an explosion of virtual reality machines makes her a man. Or actually he creates a male alter-ego of her, called Jake. Do not look at me like this; I'm just related to the way it was shown. <br /> <br /> After this, the movie is mildly fun for a while; Among all drama-school paintings, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a real comical touch to the role of Jake in her woman-captured-in-a-man body. There are some fun scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new emotions; nothing you haven't seen before, but then in this movie you connect to something that is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Justine and Jake, and hilarious antics ensue (I wish), encounter virtual machine owners who want to kidnap Jake to have sex with him or investigate him or something. Still, it is just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car gates; For such a cheap watching movie, the explosions come frequently and loudly, suggesting that the money was spent in all the wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes she can't fall in love with herself, deletes her alter ego and ends up in a nightmare with the nerd to lose her virginity (this is probably what must pass for a good end of the 90s). But only after he removes his glasses and puts on some hair gel and leather jacket; God forbids she actually having sex with a person who looks like a geek. Of course, this is a little subversive - these days with PC movies that tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it is refreshingly reactionary to have a movie that screams "CONFORM!" with you and treat virgins and nerds with the despair they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is simple dire; the nerdy is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a blunt, she is very dull (blonde, close to dresser, orange tanned, vampy accompanying music) who is a jock , he is very ... well, you get the picture. You can get away with this kind of characterization in a broad comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not very fun. It's only mildly fun in parts and scary in others. It takes a lot for a woman as sweet as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she controls it. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title; there is absolutely no erotic about the movie, and it is not about the issues of how the new communication technologies change the way we look at and acquire relationships (unless you actually think so, there is a chance that your PlayStation might blow up and change your gender). <br /> <br />
