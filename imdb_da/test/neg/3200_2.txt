I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but it's not as good as the first critics. The third episode is a bit boring, but lovely. And what is this ?? What a crap! It's stupid and real, boring. It's the worst of the series. I can't see it again because I slept at first watch sleep. And the evil side of Ugs ... eeewww ... it's one of the most horribble moments in the movie. For the first 50 minutes, we cannot see the small, frantic monsters, that is why the audience fell asleep at the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
