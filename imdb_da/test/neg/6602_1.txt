Usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, it is at least campy (ie Cybill Shepherd like Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), it is the most horrible, cheap and BORING TV movie ever made. If VH-1 is to make a TV movie, they have spent a little more money on them. Flex Alexander - but gifted with Michael's voice - is not a fantastic dancer, does not resemble Michael a bit and doesn't even have his way down. VH-1 would have done better by hiring an actual imitator, so when Michael looks into plastic surgery, he will not look the same. Why should we be surprised at the falling Michael's nose when it's as big as at the start of the movie? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor cannot act and does not look like her, and does not even make me start on the woman like Janet Jackson. Terrible script and a serious case of miscasting must keep VH-1 capable of producing more movies. Flex Alexander would have made a much better Jeremy JACKSON rather than Michael. Costumes? Trashy ripoffs. Never land? Spliced ​​recordings from news documents. Don't bother with this one .... it's not even remotely worth it. The one good piece of casting - the actor portrays Joseph Jackson and may be actress as Lisa Marie Presley, although she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl.
