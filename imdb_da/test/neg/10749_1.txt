I disagree 100% with the reviewer, who disagreed 100% with the reviewer, who gave this short film an "F" quality. Putting heavily on political propaganda excludes only Joe Dante's lack of ability to pull another Howling out of his tricks bag. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying stories, except for this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite being recognized by those who want to advance the political step, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry into a parody of the genre is not afraid of both horror and humor in the hammered release of a chopped political point. <br /> <br /> Dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stink out of the shelf as it was not his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular in this decade, and among the crops of predictable George Romero tribute and vacuum fantasies, a number of works are designed to push political or irrelevant messages. Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante is not a horror master either. What has he been since The Howling? When you want a lame anti-war zombie flick with a few pop culture references gone like humor, Homecoming can only be your thing. If you are a horror fan looking for something masterful, download ... most other episodes of the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer", based loosely on a classic cartoon card by the team of Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson - really scary.
