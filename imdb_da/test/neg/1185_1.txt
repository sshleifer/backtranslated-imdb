Please watch all 3 series and don't watch this movie, the trailer is totally misleading, and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought 25min TV episode into the most painful 2 hours of my life, truly a horrible movie. tubbs and edward are in it for a few minutes, micky has 1 line, and her lips just roll out the same tired old puns, also Mr briss accent only changes about 5 times in the movie tons of badly acted extras, and really some laughing that they seem to recycle for 2 hours, I honestly feel that this series has been completely destroyed by this godly piece of shit .......... batman and robin everything is forgiven
