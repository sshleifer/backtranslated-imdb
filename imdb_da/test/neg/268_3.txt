Seeing this movie brings more words to mind: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "unlikely", "self-indulgent" and finally (and mortally), "boring". Poorly directed, poorly photographed and poorly acted, the movie is a confusing mess with plot lines (if you can call them that) veering in all directions. Someone may have used a five-year finger painting as a template. As a punishment for this child's crime in a movie, this "star" casting should be properly tensioned and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . All in all, it seems that George needed an excuse to come with his little friends for a paid summer vacation, and we're the suckers who pay for it. Bad George! Bath!
