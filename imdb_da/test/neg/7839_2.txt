This is not a good movie. I can usually sit through a Van Damme movie if I have to, as they are usually a little laugh and do not require much thought. This has no redeeming properties. <br /> <br /> It has a clear lack of plot, humor, action, direction, etc. A real stinker at all levels. <br /> <br /> I never went out of a movie theater during a movie, even though I came close to ponds. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
