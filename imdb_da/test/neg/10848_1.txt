Don't buy this movie for comedy value as I did, I didn't find it a bit fun, but then f ****** miserable and paralyzed it's incredible. I gave it to a friend for Christmas, who was pretty funny (on my side). I recently heard that he saw it and told me what a ** eye I am! <br /> <br /> There is nothing more frustrating than seeing an overshadowed, over-dramatic, poorly-scored scene where the camera is sitting on a tripod and not moving ... the movie work is really pathetic and I can only say DONT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!! !!!!!!!
