I don't think I've seen a horror movie so bad since ... hell, I don't think I've ever seen a horror movie so bad. The action alone was enough to make a cringe. The bad play went far beyond the horror movie cheesy. It was just awful. And have you checked out these god horrible special effects? As the demon (who looked like a cheaply constructed doll) came out of the wall, I couldn't tell if I should be scared or laughed at my ass. As a big fan of the horror genre, this movie was more than mildly disappointing. I couldn't help but notice that the director is from Portland, OR, who just happens to be my own hometown. I must say that I am very ashamed. If I could, I would give this movie a negative 500.
