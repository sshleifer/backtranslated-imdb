THE QUICKIE (1 out of 5 stars) Really bad movie ... a historic historical story of a senior gangster wishing to stop passing his empire to his inert son. Of course, it won't be easy for anyone in that line or work to just finish ... so a contract is put on its life. After throwing a big party, an extra terminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I assume is * never * to trade in anything other than television movies or low budget direct to video waste ever again) is called to the scene. Our "hero" makes a passport with her ... offers her big money for a "quickie" ... she knocks down her offer even though she needs the money ... but wins up to stay anyway ... even after being brutally harassed by the supernatural son who thinks she was sent to kill her father. Ugh. The story just goes on and on ... you can see all the "twist" and "turn" come a mile away. Strange soundtrack of a group called "The Tiger Lillies" will run most people nuts ... but I thought there was some kind of cool trace towards the end. Or maybe I was just excited because I knew the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what happened to you?
