I don't even understand what they were trying to achieve with this movie, I really mean. You have this guy running from a bunch of cats because he's dead, but to be really dead, should this girl shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because they're dead? The script already has a hole in the size of Nebraska, then you have the protagonist that Susan Paterno plays, who just drone her lines in a monotonous, boring voice and with so little feeling on her face she might as well have star as one female terminator robot. It's horrible, and I don't even understand how I managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie. The end is just as stupid as the whole movie thinks you, and with absolutely no reward for it for the viewer, what ever. They might as well have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo."
