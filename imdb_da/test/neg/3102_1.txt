I watched this movie some time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it and I was voted down. I tried as well as I could to get the story because some movie agents had said it would be a movie that would be for Rob Lowe, had Pulp Fiction been for John Travolta ... Well ... we can all see that He not only failed, but he fell all the way down. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It's just not even worth watching for free on TV.
