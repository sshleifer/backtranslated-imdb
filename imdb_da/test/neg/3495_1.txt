I went to the cinema and expect to see a good movie based on all the mouth and strange reviews. the moment the opening started i knew i was in trouble. The music and the credits tried so hard to evoke emotions, I wanted to puke. everything I got from this movie was clich√©, constructed dialogue and an unemotional script. director / author Paul Haggis has managed to get good reviews with his manipulative, self-righteous writing, but it doesn't let me fool you. some performances were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is a little over rated but he was decent. Ridiculous was all on the nose. he should hold on to rapping. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left nothing ever. I find nothing interesting about her. Sandra Bullock is always the same in every movie, she's just okay. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed seeing him work. Ryan Philippe was also good. But as for the script and the miserable directing - this is actually one of the movies that is so annoyingly bad that I actually took the time to write about it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time.
