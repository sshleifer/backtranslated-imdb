A movie theater with a bad story about past cruel murders reopens. Of course, the bloody killings begin again. Written, directed, shot, scored and edited with a horrible lack of flair and finesse by the uniquely talented Rick Sloane (who later scolded celluloid more with the absolutely terrible "Hobgoblins"), this horrible ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strike out of some mess in every conceivable way: the horribly dull pacing, the painfully static, grainy filmography (there is a stinking excess of killing bullies throughout), an annoying drone and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (not) direction, a dull flashy and unintentional manuscript, the moody-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder pieces, a pitiful rude killer (he is just a wrinkled old man in pasty makeup), the uniform unpleasant and unappealing figures, a unsatisfactory abrupt ending and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired caste ensures everyone watching this schlocky swill is just as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eel drenched with sour vinegar. This crud completely lacks the required raw charm and sleazy vigor required to be fun junk. Instead, it's just a bland, plodding and meandering rig that never catches fire or even gets externally entertaining in a so-shoddy-it's-smoking kind of way. Only a smithy of nudity and the glorious presence of the always reliable Mary Woronov as a snarky, Sardinian secretary, gives a little relief from the total misery of this miserable loser.
