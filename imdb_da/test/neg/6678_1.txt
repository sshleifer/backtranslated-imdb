Normally, I wouldn't waste time reviewing a movie like "Human Pork Chop" (2001 version, not confused with the previous movie with the same title, which is probably better known in the West as "The Untold Story"), but then they reviews that are already here are pretty vague, what it really consists of, I figured I could write something more in detail, so nobody is actually tempted (as I was) to buy it because of the film's mystery. I honestly want you to stay away. <br /> <br /> **** STORE SPOILERS are included under **** <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop", I expected to be a Chinese interpretation of the popular Japanese "Guinea Pig " movie. Anyone who has seen enough of that series can see where its decision makers come from. There is a strong sense of humor running through it - you can't see the ridiculous "He never dies" without laughing and "Making of Guinea Pig" is a fabulous turn of the whole thing upside down, showing that it is just was made, with a little joy, of quite good natured gorehounds. All GP movies have a punk rock, DIY, shot-on-video aesthetics, occasional flashes of real art ("Mermaid in a Manhole"), an angry political agenda, and a crooked, awful zeal that puts them in a league of their own. <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" has none of the above. <br /> <br /> It's shot on 35mm film (with detrimental good production values), it's 90 grueling minutes long, and it's completely without any redeeming. The plot tells in a response to a police interview with the suspects about the systematic torture, death and eventual degradation of Grace, a heroinaddicted streetwalker kidnapped and brutalized by his pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from him. Despite its fleeting attempts to be a moral game, the film has a detached, inhuman feel to it, and one cannot help but dwell on the thoughts behind them. Although half-heartedly paints Grace as an innocent victim, the constant and vicious dialogue is its medieval character, and the prominent dialogue is about a shocking, totally unwelcome "she deserves!" view that makes whole things almost impossible to see. Much more time is used to clarify Grace's degradation, and when her prisoners are ultimately deemed guilty and imprisoned, it seems as if a sudden reflection on behalf of the authors has long since ceased to break. <br /> <br /> What makes it boggling why anyone wants to see such a movie is that even the kind of people who really go out of mindless sex and violence in the movies would have been seriously missed. The torture is just a continuous stream of kicks, slacks, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and so more and more bizarre power-ups on behalf of the prisoners use Grace's heroin addiction to make her bid. And when I say that, I don't understand wrong. Unlike "Guinea Pig" with the frequent barrage of nudity, which gives an almost teenage sense of mock titration to the case despite the ultraviolet, "Human Pork Chop" has no such sexual overtones. There is no real nudity in the movie, and the violence is carried out solely by the evil of the evil protagonists (as seen early in the film putting a dog in a bag and slamming it against a brick - not really, just a cheap special effect!) . The only actual bloodshed in the film is at the end when they separate Grace's body and boil the bones, all very bad special FX (nowhere near the "Guinea Pig" level), and at that stage you will probably already feel like miserable and ill to care about what's going on. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressingly gloomy and uncompromising along a similar line to Buddy Giovinazzo's "Combat Shock" and I even think could be compared by a push. Both films are about the gradual physical decline of a person who exists in a nightmarish environment without social or moral redeeming signs and both films 'climax' in a particular visceral way with the individual's inevitable, inevitable doom. <br /> <br /> In fairness, neither "glamor" is violence (whereas "Guinea Pig" could easily be accused of this), but one cannot wonder where the place is for a movie like this . It lacks many real points in its original presentation of such brutality and with a leaden pace, an almost non-existent plot line, and the aforementioned lack of entertainment value, I just can't understand what would encourage anyone to see something like that here. I have only done it to the end, solely for the purpose of reviewing it fairly ... as I hope I have now done. <br /> <br /> Total score: 0 out of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
