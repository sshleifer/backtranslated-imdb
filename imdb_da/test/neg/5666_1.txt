This show is simply terrible. I liked watching Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that The Amanda show, also fun, but it's just AWFUL. in my opinion this felt like watching them --- movies from Seltzberg, painful and unclear. It is about 3 stupid @ $$ children who make a crappy web show (while stealing the hole Ithing), while their delayed brother makes sculptures (he has no life). The shock is bad, Megan from Drake and Josh are carly (AHHHHHH!) An ugly coffin is sam and a child they have pulled out of the street plays peace. all I saw from this are random "jokes" that include the brother who makes a clay film, he also played an arcade game called the PAC rat (genious), Sam and Carly become retarder on their webshow and Fred be a dork. the only episode a case (can't remember the title) where Fred gets mishap by not anticipating an email. i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk. and why in hell do they get the youtube jack @ $$ peace, get AVGN to cancel the show with its potty mouth. just skip this show.
