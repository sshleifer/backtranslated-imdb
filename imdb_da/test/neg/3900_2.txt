When I started to see this, I immediately noticed that I couldn't understand what someone was saying. I turned up the volume. As the background sounds bloomed, I could hear the voices. What do the actors say? Is the movie not called? Do they speak Spanish? After a little confusion, I understand that it was English. At least I think so ... The amazing Jess Franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors. As a result, we cannot quite hear what they say. He's done it before. But maybe that is Mr Franco's intention? By not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on and left with more visual traces. Maybe it's just me, but I wanted to know what was going on! What about a few tips? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a "plot") concerns a young American exotic dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy kingdom people. It's a place off the coast of Spain. For this visit, a big cash payment is promised to Paula, as her boyfriend gets. He then escapes from the island, only to return later. Why? Pay close attention to the scene where the girlfriend opens Paula's American passport. Although his hand tried to cover it, you can see the actress REAL name Amber Newman, printed under the picture at the bottom of the pass !! Anyway, back to the "story": There are some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters who visit the island, all with ambiguous motives. We are witnessing sadistic games (are they right or false?) And unpleasant eateries. But the food should be good as a fake French chef prepared it! There is a young woman serving who runs around naked and never speaks. Is she really dumb? And don't we care? Of course, all women are mostly naked throughout this movie ... Oh yes, we can at least be grateful that the (50+ and overweight) men remain dressed! In addition to the eerie sound quality, what I have always admired about Jess Franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that the robber is completely extinguished. This movie is no exception ?? I needed fresh air after seeing it! <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I'm happy to report it, no matter what Mr. Franco can dream up, I'm still attracted to women.
