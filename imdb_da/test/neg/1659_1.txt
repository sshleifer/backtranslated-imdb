I rate movies on this site all the time, but I usually don't write comments. But in this case I felt compelled to WARN OTHERS! This movie is bad! It's probably one of only a dozen movies I've scored as '1 (horrible).' I know people say it all the time, but it was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's easy on the bottom ten, anyway. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I want to overlook all sorts of creepy filmmaking for a good scare. But this movie is embarrassingly bad. It seems that someone bought a camcorder from Sears and decided to make a movie with his friends. (The fact that each crew member's name appears in the cast list shows this theory, I think.) This movie has lower production standards than your average high school play. It is actually a bit shocking to see a movie that looks so poorly released on DVD. The special effects are sometimes somewhat effective, but at best still amateurish. The best thing to say about the actors is that they at least remember no to look at the camera, most of the time. I can't say for sure if they are struggling to remember their lines or make them as they walked together. Any and every attempt at humor is paralyzed. This movie is such a huge waste of time.
