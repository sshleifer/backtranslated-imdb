Well, what can I say. WHAT F ** K? There really isn't much to say about this. The only way you like this is if you laugh like a bad bad scarecrow. <br /> <br /> ACTIVATING - VERY UNCONVINCING! Just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! Rip-off by Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just awful! <br /> <br /> Gore-Really not credible. In one scene, they use one of the knives that have a lump cut out of them that fit over a body part, etc. By using this with the addition of red ketchup, it is assumed 2 look right, though it really doesn't. <plot-predictable 'kids lost in the woods on the camping weekend' movie ripped off Friday the 13th. Killer Quality-scary mask, if you're afraid of clowns, kinda incredible that someone would choose this as their costume though. Of course, the director realized that all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror-camp movies out there. <br /> <br /> A total of 3/10 * / ***** ps away from CAMP BLOOD II, one made it look like the Lord of Rings.
