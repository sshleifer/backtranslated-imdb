With an interesting premise (in conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples it was not so clear), it should have been a good movie. But the story is sabotaged by the director's overall infatuation with his own intelligence twinned with a very poor script. Yes, the natural setting is beautiful and yes, the film is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. But the filmmaker keeps the slurry lily over and over and adds layers to the over-the-top musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over to the soundtrack that ultimately passes the viewer and by paying attention to myself , it was clear that the director with his microscopic close-ups and the endless repetition of the musical motif "Danny Boy" (of all things!) tried to make a New Zealand version of an epic Sergio Leone movie, something on the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the seriousness of history (most of Leone's westerns were tongues), not to mention that it is no longer in 1968, it manages to make a parody of one. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
