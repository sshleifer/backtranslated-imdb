After Loomis, a quick recap of Micheal Myers gives us the flashback to 1989, when Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild again to find Jamie and his baby. In this version, the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more proactive than he is in the last cut. The result is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitar BS. And the end makes a little more sense. For these reasons, combined with the fact that this cut has more characterization and excitement, and cuts back on the gore factor (Halloween, as opposed to saying "Friday the 13th" Franschise, was never about to blame), why I prefer this bootleg producer's cut. Not to say that carved magic transforms a turd into gold, it just polishes the ride a little and makes it more understandable. The whole cult plot is still very stupid, just like Micheal is dodging a child <br /> <br /> My Producer's Cut Grade: C- <br /> <br /> My Theatrical Cut Degree: D-
