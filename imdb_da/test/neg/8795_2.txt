<br /> <br /> To make this short and sweet: I hope this movie will not be considered the usual work of the "gen-Asian" American film production. The play was sub-couples who rely on stereotypes, raised voices and exaggerated eye-buggery to convey their message. chris chan park does not dive deep into any of his characters, so they can remain caricatures of angry / frustrated / distant / uncommunicative asians. these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing; It makes them confusing and unsympathetic. I like to think that Asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I came out of the movie without conviction. convinced that these signs had a lifelong blood brother as the connection with each other to go to the lengths they did to help their mate. convinced that the protagonist had something beyond a superficial attraction to his girlfriend. convinced that hard-working immigrant parents would not pay for their son's college education. unconvinced that all the signs were even necessary, that is: janet, who is put in bed at the back of the car and quickly forgot. the story line, which i actually think had potential, was not allowed to come in on its own for two reasons: 1) flat signs for whom i had no sympathy / affinity, 2) the plot overshadowed by meaningless non-sequitur scenes, such as seance / donut shop sequence with amy hill which was simply ridiculous and unnecessary. I recommend parking for his efforts as I am sure it took very hard work to produce the movie myself, and I will even give him the benefits of the doubt about this time as a rookie instructor / scriptwriter, but I sincerely hope he will next go a little deeper. Just because the movie is one of the first in its kind about the Korean American experience, does not mean that it is automatically good.
