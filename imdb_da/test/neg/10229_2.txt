Also the title -> The Magical Castle -> This one is a stretch. Why worry? Why create another rockbar and then add another story line that has almost nothing to do with the doctor or swan lake. Only some rockable girlfriend, the stolen book with banned art and the original characters (no votes remain). Stripped to his bars this is a continuation of a thread. The next thing you know is that some birds will have remembered the "forbidden art" and the Swan Princess 4: The magic bird will be born. Fortunately, the chapters are apparently closed, and this will begin, but the poorly-closed trilogy will come to an end.
