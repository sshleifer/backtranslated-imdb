Basic History The idea of ​​ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent - two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further cover the costs, the other two strangers get together. What makes it interesting is the conditions both before and during this holiday - especially showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlook on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is completely spoiled by two important performances in the ensemble cast, which are so bad that they destroy the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her seem ridiculous. Her "do-eyed" expression and idle stare make you wonder if this is not a zombie movie, or she should just be an idiot! And to make matters worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so unpleasant and bombastic that I was very close to extinguishing the movie - he was so horrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10 - which is very, very hard to understand. Sure the movie has a good mood and a good plot, but these two laughing silly notions cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry, but this movie was painful for a remake!
