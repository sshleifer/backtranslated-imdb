When Hollywood tries to understand what an "intelligent person" is, they fail so miserably and find it difficult to put words into the mouth of the alleged "genius". <br /> <br /> Right, a genius walks around and tries to rub in its superiority at each case. Sure they hang out in bars and choose matches ?? It is not as if they are (generalize wild) autistic nerds who never have a brownish. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you are a genius, you know all about math and history and politics and of course you are constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them. Coz these things that everyone goes together n things, okay? <br /> <br /> Plus, you walk around with a smirk all the time. You are just an alley son of a you-know-what, so it is. <br /> <br /> And of course you smoked like someone who's never smoked before, but you smoke, it's like cool n stuff you know. And you're different. It is understood. <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight ?? You are a bullying. A bullying that finds time to study 10,000 books when he does not lift weights. And when he doesn't smoke or drink beer, because he follows a strict health regime. <br /> <br /> And you're dating a 30-something college student ?? Minnie Driver. Well, I don't even want to comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already hit the nail on its head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a daydream of a Beavis & Butthead type student (in other words, 95% of them): "Yes, that's what I would be like if I were a genius." Stupid people and stupid writers cannot imagine the life of the geniuses in this case.
