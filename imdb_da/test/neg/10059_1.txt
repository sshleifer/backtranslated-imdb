I have never seen so much talent and money spent producing something so bad in my life! As seen from other comments, one who is talented as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland and many others is thrown together in a movie that cannot be recognized as an Agatha Christie story. I'm still thinking how it might be with the same throw, done the right way. <br /> <br /> The movie has even less intimacy than Christopher Reeves' 'Superman' movie. The big throw makes the smooth production even less effective than in these films because there is not enough time to get to know each other. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack had wondered if the wrong video was in the case from the rental shop. The music became more and more offensive when the plot developed. It's hard to say whether the audio track or the annoying technique of repeating information from previous scenes was more offensive. From someone who has seen most Christie movies (that was what attracted me to this, it was one of the few I hadn't seen) missing this one. It's not an Agatha Christie movie. The Golan Globus is better suited for producing flicks about big time wrestling, rather than the cozy atmosphere of English mystery.
