This is a very strange movie, with a no name and almost nothing about it online. It uses an approach known to those who have looked like Creepshow, introducing a trilogy of so-called "horror" shorts and blending them into a connecting tale of the people involved in the segments coming out of a bus. There is a narrator who talks about relationships, but his speeches add absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just add to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well. I swear I didn't have a clue why this movie got an 18 certificate in the UK, which would bring it in line with similar Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing here is even extremely scary. There are no gore, sex, nudity or even a sword to live things up, these are the kinds of things you can put on Children's TV, and no one will bat an eyelid. I can only think if it had the rating it really deserved (a PG), no serious horror fan would be seen dead with it, so the dealer probably buffet BBFC until they relented. Nevertheless, here are the three stories in summary: 1. A man is dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fianc√©. 2. A man living in a dirty apartment is understandably freaked out as a living organism evolved from its six-month-old tuna bowl. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service .. that is until he starts acting oddly .. And there you have it. Some of them are pretty entertaining because of their outlandish premises (my favorite is number 2), but you get the feeling they were supposed to be a) scary and b) moral plays, unfortunately they fail in both cases. In summary, this flick is a fuzzy curiosity .. for very good reasons.
