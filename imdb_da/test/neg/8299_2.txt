Okay, if you like your monster moovies hungry, stiff, starchy and thunderous boring, but with lots of gassing, then go straight to "Lady Frankenstein", a stagy costumy Italian liar. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the crusty old Baron himself and must really need to make condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in a number of European B films, usually like Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Moon Men", plays her ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress. Cotten makes a nasty monster with big heads (it's really so much to do a good one?), As immediately gasman Cotten (who took his royalty check and ran) and wanders around blowing everyone in sight. Tania (Bay) decides to change the brain of his girlfriend (who is old and curly) with a youngster's brain (who is "beautiful" but stooopid) to make another monster smear the first monster Cotten made wandering around about throttling people. Well, after much show, and a little blasting, the two monsters stick to each other for a little while, Tania sticks the first monster back and then has sex in her manor's flaming ruins with the other monster - only to make him smear her ! Doh! There is so much blasting that you even overlook the fact that the film is as exciting as a dead carp, and pops up just as fast. The Alpha Video version I saw for this review was heavily edited and you wonder how much nekkid people were carved out, not that it would have improved the movie much. Vice President von Theurmer has previously helped a number of varieties of Euro Z waste, including "Jungle Warriors", "The Island of the Dead" (like Mel Wells) and "The Crucified Girls of San Ramon". MooCow says to avoid this corpse of a movie and find something that mooves in the moore of a full ... accelerator. <br /> <br /> = 8)
