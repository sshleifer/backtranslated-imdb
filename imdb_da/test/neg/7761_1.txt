I see family affairs, coronation st and east enders on weekends every week night family relationships are by far the worst, bad plots, bad sequences and the worst act of any soapie, even worse than the Americans, and that says something. <br /> <br /> I find it very frustrating that all of these shows on Oct. Australia "are so far behind the UK and when you try to figure out the reason for this, they just beat you off with a story that they will show double episodes to catch It is unnecessary to say that this never happens, I am very happy that family affairs go, to make room for something of better quality, but at the same time I would know the background reasons, so they knew finally, how bad it was, did people stop seeing it? No matter what it was, you weren't left in excitement why do you feel you have to keep everything a secret from your fans? do not care? I feel strongly that you should try to keep your publicly updated. Family relationships are notorious for just havi as its characters disappear and are seen as no reason, we become involved in the people and enjoy following their lives. why family relationships should come to an end, although we are so far behind here in Australia, it is easy to see that the authors run out of ideas for new plot, so many plot repeats and old episodes come back. I also noticed that as new characters are introduced, many of them are really bad actors as if you are scratching the bottom of the barrel and ending up with the dragon greeting Vince
