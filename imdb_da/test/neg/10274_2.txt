We found this movie almost impossible to see. With such a super cast it is a shame that the writing and the direction were so horrible. The outrageous pace of the story was crazy. Flashbacks were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-haired metaphors - the river, the cat - were repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. <br /> <br /> The photography in Empire Falls was lovely. It was too bad that it was not a travel explanation. I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style, but had some quibbles with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the screenwriters and the director were so confused by the novel's reputation that they felt they had to include every single thing in their movie. This was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not books on tape.
