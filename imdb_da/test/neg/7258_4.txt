DEADLY MANTIS certainly won't scare anyone, but as sci-fi programmers go it is better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole defrosts a giant prehistoric preying mantis at the North Pole. Military men disappear. Dr. Down (William Hopper - Hedda Hopper's son and most commonly known as Paul Drake on TV's PERRY MASON) is called i.d.d. the creation - but at this time the being has eaten several Eskimo and is on its way to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About one-third or more of the movie consists of stock footage: old public educational films, military men in radar spaces, planes - and would you think Eskimos set out on the sea? Of course, this explains why a strain of Eskimo is attacked in the movie. ("Hey, Guys! Think we can work in this?") Mix in some insignificant special effects, a lumpy dialogue and some sexist attitudes, and you're good to go. Not as original as MONSTER, who challenged the world, but fans of the 1950s "big bug" schlock will enjoy it - and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn on the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
