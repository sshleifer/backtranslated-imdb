Be warned the next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in any production run away. Quick. <br /> <br /> Kelly appeared to the world after his last movie, "Southland Tales", that he is a pretentious instructor. It was indulgent and overdue. In "The Box" not much has changed. <br /> <br /> I can see what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been, and I bet the bosses in the studio ate it all up: a full movie based on one of Richard's "Twilight Zone" Mathesons old short stories. Big mistake! Don't read any more unless you want this movie totally pampered for you: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien who uses his body as a vessel to perform "experiments" where mankind's fate rests. His face is scarce because he was hit by Alien Lightening, who killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all this red button exercise. Of course, when Norma pushes the button, knowing that someone can die, she must suffer the consequences of failing to consider the lives of others instead of her own. In the end, she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow deaf and blind. Kelly dances about her movie's "message" and tries to get the audience to figure out what the morals of history are. It is clear that every person with a brain says at the beginning: "What if I was the person who dies?" Richard Kelly does not even allow his character to have this normal human conversation. In fact, they avoid it all together. They seem to both be educated, work at a prestigious school and also to NASA, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to look out of the box ??? <br /> <br /> If he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the whole movie could be finished right there! Instead, we'll see weddings continue forever, NASA and NSA are happy that Arlington Stewart takes over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden's life beyond our world, making it "easier" to kill his wife, and drone is ruled by Steward who can be anywhere and nowhere, anytime. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is pacing. Nothing really happens. It's a confused mish-mash of ideas that are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is insufficiently marketed. The ads make it look like "Saw" and even use the music from these movies to sell it. In fact, what you get is a slow, boring, ridiculous (yes, half of the theater was laughing at the plays and visual effects) and messy movies that are neither imaginative, interesting nor coherent. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted, and suddenly she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on her way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Are we really interested? No longer will you not. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really won't worry about what happens to any of the characters. You will rooting for them all to die so the movie will just end. Go see something else that plays. Don't waste your time or money.
