This "movie" will give me nightmares, I will wake up in sweat and scream: "I didn't make this movie, please don't blame me!" I honestly think it would have been more enjoyable to see a fat guy eating pigs in his mothers cellar for an hour or two than to look at this shit. I understand that money was tight but god, what the hell they were thinking, there was no thought, plot or effort put into this. This movie needs a warning. "Kindly love God, not finance the drama department of the local JC." On another note, these are the least sympathetic characters I've ever seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler in them. Then finally take my advice next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred Adivl and let sleep come.
