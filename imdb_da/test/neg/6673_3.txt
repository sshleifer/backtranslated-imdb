Czech filmography travels through dark times ... this film is a concrete proof. Of course, Slama wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictitious people that are characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to live in a dilapidated hut with an innocent alcoholic aunt. Because of Tonik's idiocy, which can just announce "father, I don't want to work at the factory" (I really want to know why) I understand the condition of his "house", but I'm really not able to digest the awful mess around. Hugged sentimentality everywhere. Why didn't Monika escalate her boy to work abroad? Young Czech couple do it very often. And take other people's children to live in a broken barn ... it's too much. Irresponsible mother (poorly behaved by Geislerov√°), naive & stupid boy (Tonik), silly and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone has already told it - badly directed and acted soap opera. Actors like Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece.
