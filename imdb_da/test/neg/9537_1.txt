I like bad movies, but this thing is a steaming pile. From the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and destructive action, don't waste a second on this pile. Fifth graders could have made a better movie and first graders could have written a better script. Do you want a real synopsis? Ugly chicks in neon bikinis dances too long. An inconsistent plot became worse with horrible action. The locations were not even acceptable. Church scenes take place in a dance study, and oh yes - what about the two tap-dance numbers coming up of the blue? Oh, and the total number of naked breasts that could not I have even saved this movie - 0. Add this to the trash.
