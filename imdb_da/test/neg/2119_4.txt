This is a perfect example of why many say the 90s are sucked when it comes to horror movies. A boring voodoo-on-campus tale of terror starring at the once promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, THE LOST BOYS, etc.). There may be just enough things happening to keep you asleep, and it doesn't seem to be cheap, but it's still fearing an audience that was in their very early teens in the 90s. I could have been part of that audience, but still I was as good as nothing out of it when I saw it now. And today, teens are accustomed to much more and better already, and I can't imagine any of those who know or care about who Corey Feldman was. Or, "is" when the guy still produces movies. But the only thing that still connects him with his days of glory is the recently released LOSET BOYS 2: TRIBE sequel. And I imagine that you will not encourage anyone to find out VOODOO. Just another movie that was lost in the 90's horror for obvious reasons.
