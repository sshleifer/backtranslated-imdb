I just finished watching this movie and think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so boring that I found myself zooming through it at X2 speed and finished in less than 30 minutes. I was not only disappointed, but angry that I had wasted my money on renting it. It's within the top five of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The reason was very confusing. Had I first read the DVD sleeve cover before I rented it, I would have been completely lost throughout this movie. I would not have thought that Tim Robbins, after making such good films as "Shawshank Redemption", would have agreed to appear in this movie.
