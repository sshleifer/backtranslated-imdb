The first movie I saw from these people was "Children of the Tomb," and when I heard that this was coming, I thought it would be good to see most of it because Waverly is a real place rumor that be haunted. This documentary / movie was AWFUL! There was too much fake comment from the producers, directors, camera men ... they needed to keep their faces out of this movie. Waverly has been smoked to be haunted for a long time, but if anyone doubts it sees this movie, they will no doubt start believing that every story about the place is as false as this documentary. The paranormal evidence was terrible and almost non-existent. I've heard better EVPs from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom! They tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not the stories, not the blurry for the dark to see any videos, not the pictures, not the tape recordings! Burial children were also bad, but at least it had some substance and a little bit of creep factor. The only reason I give this a 3 is because history's part of the show was very good and informative. Learning about how the hospital came, the daily life there and how it ended was the only thing worth being in this 2-hour piece of crap.
