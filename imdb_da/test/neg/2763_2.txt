If this movie is a precise view of J. Smits's capabilities, I think he made a big mistake when he left the television. Didn't he see any movies starring David Caruso, especially "Cold Around the Heart"? Along the lines of working ability, what about Mary-Louise, she has done much, much better. Yes, it is a horrible script, inappropriately edited, and completely lacking in continuity, but skilled players can and have overcome similar obstacles. A very big disappointment.
