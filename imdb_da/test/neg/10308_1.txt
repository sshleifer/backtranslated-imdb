Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. I am usually proud to enjoy any movie, no matter how bad, but it was just too much. I would only suggest seeing this movie as a torture unit. If you can get past the horrible plot and dialogue by seeing it on the mute, it makes even more horrible camera work and scary special effects this movie a real horror. If you're thinking of seeing this, because your Sandra Bullock fan doesn't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is terribly horrible. Not to mention the rest of the cast that could be replaced by baboons who would do a better job, at least we should not listen to the terrible dialogue.
