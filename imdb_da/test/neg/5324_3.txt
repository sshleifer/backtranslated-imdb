I actually saw the movie before I read the book. When I watched the movie, I was sorry because I wondered why Dean Koontz had made such a bad book / movie. The movie was confusing and had no power at all, it was choppy and made me throw a rock on the TV. I couldn't connect the characters at all, so I didn't care what happened to them (usually I love the characters because I can relate to their personality or problems). Then I read the book and loved it. I often read the book and the film collects dust. I wish someone would make a Koontz movie that follows his books, and then the movies wouldn't suck so much. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, DO NOT HAVE TO KEEP WASTE MONEY!
