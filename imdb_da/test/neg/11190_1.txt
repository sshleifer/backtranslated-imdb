A man kicks a dog 2 'in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman kicks a cow out of her bed. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> A woman sucks on a status stand for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a blind man in his stomach. <br /> <br /> Jesus rapes a young girl. <br /> <br /> There you have it. I just saved you an hour in your life. There are probably those whom this "shocking love with cinematic expression" would appeal to. But I didn't find it different from the puerile, offline videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade. Except that we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> Having heard endless sermons from beard artistic artists of how such an important movie is, I thought it would be worth my time. Don't make a mistake it's bad. If I hear someone call Buñuel "father of cinematic surrealism," I think I should beat someone. About something, he issued a big step back from the surrealistic beginnings, such as his seniors Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) pioneered 10 years earlier. It made a joke out of it all, as if Buñuel did not trust really to embrace the sarcasm of art, like l'abourdité. It would take Buñuel another 40 years before he would refine his style to something admirable. Skip the early stuff and hop straight to the 1970s if you want to be more impressed with his work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure he would agree. In 1977, Buñuel stated that he would like to burn all the prints from his old film. In this case, I would be happy to pour the lighter fluid.
