Nothing about this movie is any good. It is a formal predictable "romantic comedy" intended to force women to see their significant others. In other words, it is a predictable chic flick that is neither comical nor romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like to watch the same thing over and over again, this movie fits perfectly. I was also forced to see this with my g / f at that time and that is no surprise we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over just with different actors. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (a b / c I can't give it a zero.
