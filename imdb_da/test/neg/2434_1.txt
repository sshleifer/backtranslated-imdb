I think it was a terrible mistake on Disney's part. First of all, Kuzco does NOT need to pass "emperor school" to become an emperor! It has never happened before. Second, the new voices do not sound like the originals. Very poorly prepared. And while I loved the movie The Emperor's New Groove, the new school is just stupid. Like all jokes are the same, and many are from the movie. The reason becomes superfluous, always Yzma (is that how you spell it?) Trying to become Empress, Kuzco stops her, etc. Or Kuzco learns to become a better person. I think Kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions. He's a spoiled abrupt, and it bothers me. I don't think it's worth five minutes of your time, much less than half an hour.
