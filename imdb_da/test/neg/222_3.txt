I went to see this movie today, hoping it would include at least half an intelligent story. I was very disappointed as it didn't. The reason, and the protagonist's decisions, were so far retrieved. I was hoping for a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie, but instead got something totally unacceptable. I actually found myself hoping that the "hero" would be turned off, and I almost went out of the theater on several occasions as this should have happened, but it didn't. Heist movies aren't going to be sensitive flicks, and this one tried to be just that. Every few minutes in the second half of the movie I found myself saying "no way". Without giving the whole story away, it revolved around a hooded car guard who was financially down and out, and whose house went into foreclosure. He was invited into a hoist, and accepted, only to come back when the action started. Weak.
