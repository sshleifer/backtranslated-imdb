Throughout the 1950s and 60s, 70s, and even 80s, a lot of war movies were produced in former Yugoslavia, which glorified the "Partisans" domination? civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, generally known only in Eastern Europe, instructed very few of these "partisan" stories; Unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. The "Eagles Camp" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploitation of the Partisan Air Force. Marshal Tito decides that a partial air force should be formed to combat the German Luftwaffe in the sky over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join two small biplanes and start tearing enemy bases and convoys. Over the course of several months, several pilots and planes go together and eventually form a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable? Whatever it is, it is certainly not convincing, but a caste of great actors will make it work. <br /> <br /> The film opens strongly with a well-shot German air raid on defenseless partisans. Nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost instantaneously, and in a short distance the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly becomes another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure. All the characters are known clich√©s: Major Dragan (played by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He explodes into conflicting plans with a machine gun and even has an aerial duel with the scruffy Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable result. The rest of the partisans are well known: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a hotshot playboy; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic ("The Day That Shook The World") is Dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up the row and eventually becomes an experienced fighting pilot. The characters and their stories are known to every war fan, and Krvavac is not trying to build on these stereotypes. The cast does a fair job and, despite the two-dimensional script, each player is engaging and fun to watch. Bajic especially has some good moments ?? when to take his first flight that shoots, and later when he has to land a plane after the pilot is killed. The plot consists only of a series of air strikes against the Germans and subsequent retaliatory actions. <br /> <br /> Krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual recordings and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the thumbnails are so cheap and false that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy airplanes are scary and ridiculous. Some of the punishment and bombing scenes look shockingly true, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just pathetic. Sometimes the smoke guns from the "machine guns" are so large that the smoke attacks the entire model plane. Worse, the editors often shot warriors over real recordings. Although the plane is normally in the correct perspective, they are surrounded by a distracting glow that prevents any attempt at realism. All these actions are set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "Battle of the Eagles" also suffers from a very poorly edited English language release. To begin with missing 28 minutes of footage ?? cutting the film from 130 minutes to just 102. The missing segments were carelessly carved and the cut looks very blunt. Music tracks are suddenly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. In the last third of the movie, the story falls apart and only some badly needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. So is there dubbing ?? All scenes that rotate around the partisans are dubbed in English (though rather bad), but several long scenes remain in German, without the benefit of subtitles. The movie could have been much more meaningful if the German-language sequences had been carved instead of important scenes relating to the partisans. On the plus side, Krvavac handles the outdoor recording quite well. There is never a moment when the audience feels like they are on a soundstage. The German Luftwaffe bases are particularly expansive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and optional extras in leather flight jackets. The landscape is fresh and green, and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or far away just to convey the reach of a battle or a long trek. A German ambush on a partisan unit early in the picture stands out, like an order in which Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base. As found on home video, "Eagles Battle" is just another of many stories of the Yugoslavian partisan movement. There is nothing that distinguishes it from the rest of the crop, and the horrible special effects and drastic editing put it in a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid this unless you can find a full length copy.
