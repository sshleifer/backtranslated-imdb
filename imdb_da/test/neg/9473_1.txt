I saw Roger Moore huffing it on scenes that required running or exercise. He was a James Bond who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar telling stories with his British knights. Nothing against the elderly in age-related roles, but how realistic is it for a weak 58-year-old man to fight on the plane's wings, hang out of the train, swim in a swamp with crocodiles, etc. ? Aside from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, rapid and moronic, the fact that a weak oldster involved in many death-killing stunts made it easier to laugh at James Bond. In 1983, Roger Moore was clearly at his age and he was long past the time he looked as if he could fight with younger men. I watched this movie in the Theater, and the laughs of laughter were many and very often. Any credibility that James Bond had built was gone after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supportive cast. Another low point was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was half the evil axis. Jordan helped make the whole concept even more ridiculous. And the Russian general was a total goof. OCTOPUSSY works better as a comedy spoof similar to SPIES LIKE USA. Even the battle situation on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes that were performed in many other films by better actors. Take Emperor of the North (1972), where Lee Marvin & Ernest Borgnine fought over the top and bottom of the train and made it look exciting and right. Roger Moore had a thin, fragile body in 1983 and yet his stunt-double was clearly a younger, higher, athletic and muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. This only made his fighting scenes more comical. The Moore stuntmen looked like the old low-budget Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially with the poor editing. The director seemed to try to make the bad plays and bad stunts better by giving more views on the same stunt. This only highlighted the differences between Moore and his stunt double. The fact that the train scenes with Moore were shot in a studio could be noticed from the lighting as Moore was in the shot compared to the stunt-double exterior shot on a real train. Although many of the Bond films have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt games. You can usually see clearly that the Bond actor does not actually fight. Overall, OCTOPUSSY must be one of the worst movies ever made and easily the worst of the worst Bond movies.
