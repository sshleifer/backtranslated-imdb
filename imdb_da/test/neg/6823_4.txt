This is a beautiful round on the mill family move which I am sure most children will enjoy, but with really not so much to please any adult to watch the movie. The premise of the movie is that Belushi's policeman takes his pension, but is drawn into a case that results in him becoming a private investigator. The movie's plot is so obvious, most of the kids will definitely choose the end before it happens. But in addition, there seems to be history arches and subplots that are forgotten when the film progresses. This combined with a subplot where the titular K-9 is stamped out by Belushi. One to avoid, I'm afraid.
