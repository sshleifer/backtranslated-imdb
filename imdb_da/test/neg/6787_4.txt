As a true Canadian, I always avoid Canadian movies. But now and then I get caught watching one. This one is better than most, which is to say mediocre. It has many of the common mistakes in Canadian films ... self-conscious plays ... a surplus of cinematic gimmicks and, above all, the self-destructive Canadian habit of using Canadian cities as stand-ins to American. I think using the historic metropolis of Montreal as a standpoint for Harrisburg Pennsylvania is just as obscene. I was in a generous mood. I gave it a 4. <br /> <br />
