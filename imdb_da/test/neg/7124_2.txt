The original GRUDGE (the original American remake) surprisingly surprised just about everything you could do right with a ghost girl. It had excitement, dark and moody atmosphere, some good jolts and some really scary pictures. GRUDGE 2 tries all these techniques, but ultimately fails, only showing us the same old things we saw in the first movie, as well as a messy story that constantly changes from Tokyo to California. It starts in Tokyo with some school girls walking into the house, now heavily blocked by a bunch of police tape. One of them comes from face to face with a similar brilliant-eyed ghost girl while they are trapped in a closet. She goes out and screams cheeky and they all run away. Then we cut to America, where Kar's sister was sent by their mother to Japan to find and bring her home. We eventually find ourselves in a very well-known concept involving a curious guy and girl examining the story of a mysterious house. We cut back and forth to the girls from the start, who disappear one by one, as well as a young boy who hears strange sounds in the next occasion at night, leading to a very unsatisfactory end. The "scare" scenes are dull and ineffective. Like The Ring 2, avoid this god horrible successor ...
