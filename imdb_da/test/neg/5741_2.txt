I like vampire movies, I like B-movies, I love B-vampire movies. But this one has almost nothing for it. Some of the actors are horrible, especially by 3 of the male leaders. The story is not very interesting. In a relatively short 88 minutes, it still seems too long, and you will find yourself quick forwarding a little. There is an awful lot of kung-fu vampire attacks. Sounds cool? It's not when it's made on a low budget. It will be very fast again. There is some less blood and do, nothing to get excited about. There are some good wires where you can see the wires. It has some good landscapes filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Not worth renting
