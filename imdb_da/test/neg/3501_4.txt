The good: The action was great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Support Actor instead of Matt Dillon. BAD: I am a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT, in spite of my life experiences and the movie's subject, I would definitely not say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact it is FAR from it. I have problems with this movie, both from a film agent perspective and from a visible minority perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremities in a sign, for example, that Matt Dillon is a racist policeman and a good caregiver for his sad father, does not in any way mean that the character is well-developed. Yes, I admit that in a large cast ensemble as in this movie, it is quite difficult for each character to be well-developed, BUT this does not mean that none of the characters should be so. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue seems to be really surprised that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a play that does NOT write the class because it is good but to show students and future screenwriters what not to do. I just felt that I was hit by the head again and again how bad racism is. I understand it. <br /> <br /> (3) The reason seems so random, it's ridiculous. What are the chances that a black car robber runs over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficking while he enters his van, and the same black car robber ended up carjacking the Asian lighthouse van several hours later when he took him to the hospital, only to find out that the more Asians traded inside the habit just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or how about the scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman falling down the stairs and all her prejudices and hatred disappeared into thin air? If it was so simple, why not throw all the racists down the stairs in America so they will have a heart change? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my greatest concerns about this movie are unrealistic views of racism. As a person who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I have been refused entry into a supermarket because I am not white. Did the shopkeeper say because I wasn't white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were many people shopping inside. Did he shout for racers? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers will probably not stop picking you up because you are non-white, but that doesn't mean they will try to cross you or come out and say racist veil. If a Chinese woman joined me, I would not say "blake! Blake! Learn some English bitch!". On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally joined a Mexican woman, I would not say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. This is not how it works. Instead, I will hand over my insurance information, say sorry and go home and tell my colleagues, friends and family that the Mexicans are bad drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the true racism. It's hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Crash is not original as opposed to what some people might say. Interlocking and interweaving history lines, plots and characters have been done before. "Magnolia" is a movie that makes this much better than Crash did, and yet it was never nominated for Best Picture on the Oscar. It had a star player - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really scares me how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.
