Man, what a horrible movie. As with many horrible movies, the structure lies in its horrible hull in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the whole genre a bad name. Okay, here's a big problem: Sandra Bullock's character is abducted by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy grocery store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness to this action, and then uses most of the film completely clueless about her whereabouts. Come on! Personally, I find this quite insulting to even the weakest of audience members. Yet we have to buy into this nonsense. Equally frustrated is the poorly explained motive for Jeff Bridge's actions. His character is a bit of an eccentric academic, to be safe, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He goes through about ten minutes, gives or takes, wasting his prayers to Sutherland, why he has done his cruel acts. But the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary logical feeling. Therefore, no intelligent audience can really believe in the possibility of his evil. And if you draw that element from the story, it all falls apart. <br /> <br /> Also with great concern: -Jeff Bridges uses a strange, pseudo-French accent for no reason. <br /> <br /> - The whole tedious plot that involves Nancy Travis, especially her rescue of the day by turning the tables on Bridges. <br /> <br /> - The crazy woman who somehow manages to remember Jeff Bridges' license plate, despite also thinking that Lucky Charm's leprechaun is genuine. <br /> <br /> -Sandra Bullock's character's name, Diane Shaver, makes it convenient to scramble to form the word "disappeared". Are you friggin 'fun me? -The logistical impossibility of laying, abducting and burying (in a very distant place) a person within a minute's duration (which Bridges specifically refers to). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that made me remember the fictitious, stupid (yet very successful) Donald Kaufman character in adaptation. Many writers are brilliant inspired artists. Some are just bozos who convince the nitwits who are running studios to make their drive. This particular script is so amazingly dimwitted that Donald Kaufman himself would have managed to sell it. Unfortunately, Todd Graff unfortunately made us all in the real world.
