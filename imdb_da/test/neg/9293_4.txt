An ex-informant from East Germany finishes in Mexico as a spy of a student group in 1971, where she falls in love with one of the activists. This is the first co-production of Mexico with Germany, and although it is a good picture of the ideals that marked and continue to mark (at least to the CGH), the youth is so finished with something incomplete since the internal dilemmas as it faces Dark Brown (Noethem) as the passion of its ideals, which Adela feels (Campomans), as soon as they seem to me to assume in the case of the language barrier; and in the case of her lack of experience. The reason why ultimately there is no concrete identification with any of them, which means that what could have been movies that even served as a document like Red Dawn ended up being a movie more; although I would like to clarify that many of the assistants in the room were tense in the conversation with the director, telling me that they are no longer so young or my ideals have changed.
