I watched this movie in the Edinbourgh theater with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester, and we all thought it was a waste of time. We would have spent an extra hour watching vapid dialogue of Star Wars III, which played down at a time than all of this. <br /> <br /> Opening one of the worst jokes I've ever seen is bound to celluloid on the big screen, it didn't matter with a bang. Throughout the film we got the feeling that the jokes just tried too hard, the authors thought of the setup so much that you could see the joke come 2 minutes in advance, so when it came, it was so lacking that you couldn't even smile; I mention giraffe cum-ming as a good example. <br /> <br /> The plot itself offers some interesting thoughts in my mind that entertained me much more than what happened on the screen. I think much more could have been done with the angle (the two different worlds, the character of the fish's water-out-of-water, the confusion and the surprise when people try to understand and distinguish the characters and the authors from each other.) But for much time is wasted pushing this painful plot to the end with so much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as it is humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say that 16th century characters show some extra talent from the authors, it is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who might have made this movie a worthy 40 minute reflection; but no, it is a full-length torture movie of independence. <br /> <br /> When we left the theater, which had very little laugh inside it, I overheard the young hip-electro clash British couple behind me and said, "It was pretty good, it wasn't." You never really knew what came next. "And the girl answers" yes, quite surprisingly. "And that is it. If it is supposed to get out of British people from watching a comedy: no laughing for 90 minutes, but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers in at the end, this movie succeeded, but I have more faith in the British life than that. <br /> <br /> I haven't laughed so hard at a comedy movie since American Pie II.
