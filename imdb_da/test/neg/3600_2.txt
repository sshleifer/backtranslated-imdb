This comes from an adult who came across the first to expect a movie aimed at children and was amazed at the adult humor that was in the emperor's new groove. The character I liked most was Kronk, so I was thrilled when I heard about the successor (sp) with nothing but "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just saw Kronk's new groove, it took me two days because I had to shut it off, I was so bored halfway through it. I finally saw the rest of it the next day, and unfortunately the second half was just as boring as the first. To be a Disney movie, I expected some musical scenes, but this one was full of them and they were not entertaining. The great thing I found about Emperors New Groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. Crowns New Groove in honesty did nothing for me or my girlfriend, and we both loved the first. It's really aimed at young children, comedy is pretty childish, the musical scenes aren't very well done and the plot itself is extremely grainy. <br /> <br /> Save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worth another view. I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how this movie was thrown together. They have actually managed to make a character (Kronk) not fun in this movie, it's great in itself. Of course, every opinion is different, but I am very easily enraged, I usually enjoy successors (sp) even when others discredit them, mostly because I loved the first so much I needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was, that I would enjoy the movie. I can't say the same for this one, I would never have thought I'd turn it off halfway because of sheer boredom. Buy at your own risk.
