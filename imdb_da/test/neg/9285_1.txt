I saw it late at night on a smaller canal, and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comedian and I figured he could be a good stand-up comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I couldn't have been more wrong. This concert was horrible. It was filled with racist comments aimed at white people, Muslims and individuals from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence's smart mind) and rattling clich√© philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, cannot resist the urge to preach When you get a platform, do we really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights fight during a stand-up comedy show?). Then there were his fawning comments designed to incite him with women, it made my skin creep listen to him. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the show was simply not fun, and I found it boring. I turned halfway through and returned to find him who still preached or continued and on and on about his child's birth (there was no humor in the story of his child's birth, and it was self-reliant on his part to drill us with the details He obviously didn't have much to say or he would have cut this section of the show. <br /> <br /> This show was bad: Runteldat!
