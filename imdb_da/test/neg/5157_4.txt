The Nest is really just another 'nature run amock' horror flick that fails because of the low budget. The action is ok, and the setting is good, but somehow the whole movie just seemed a bit boring to me. Gore effects are not the best I have seen but are fun in a cheesy kind of way. The cockroaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. The Nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you liked The Nest, Snails is a must-see as it's ten times better. It's also worth noting that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another "Nature Run Amock" movie called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), which is about killer rats that you might have guessed. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy these types of horror movies, you might want to give this a watch, but you would be far better looking at slugs that are far more interesting and horrified.
