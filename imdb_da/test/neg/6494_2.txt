PROTECTION. You hear the name. You think, "ah, it's a crappy Hong Kong movie." Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes it is bad. This incredibly stupid Jackie Chan movie, destroyed by us, yes us, the Americans (I cook with anger, ooh, I think I'm jumping into the window!), Chan as New York policeman has hunted down a gang, waiting for him buddy's death. Sounds cool ... but it's not. Don't waste your money by renting it. To prove he could make a better policeman, Chan made the amazing POLIS STORY (1985).
