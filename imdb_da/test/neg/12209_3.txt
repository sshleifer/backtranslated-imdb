As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can't claim to have had this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the novel's size asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It's just impossible to capture a significant amount of events taking place in the two-hour history. I don't enjoy the exciting flashback format. It was uneven and would be impossible for a person who did not already know the story to fully understand. Also, I don't think the filmmakers correctly interpret Copperfield's personality. The idea that he turned around on a beach that moaned about his life seems incompatible with the proactive, forward-looking nature Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes disturbed me too. She came across as a ditsy household decoration, rather than a strong woman. However, Dora was perfect. This movie was full of trouble and I am eagerly waiting for someone to make a decent screen version.
