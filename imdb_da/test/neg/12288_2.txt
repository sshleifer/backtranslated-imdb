Okay, I watched this movie when I was very small, and the day we clean out in the closet, I see it! I thought, "I have no idea how this movie was," so I went ahead and put it in. HAN MY GOD !!!!! This movie is so darn bad! I never thought that this movie could ever come as close to my least favorite movie as it did, but I laughed because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous It wasn't fun !!!! So many things in this movie were funny because it was so stupid. This movie is not anywhere near good. I have to say if you want to watch this movie then you are definitely no better something big and if you have already seen it, trust me, I also feel your pain !!!!
