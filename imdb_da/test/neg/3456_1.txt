It's amazing to me that the best rendition of this amazing story is a comic book made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but its true. Here, another clumsy experimental puzzler and alienates confuse viewers with admirable effectiveness, while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. Irving's original work is short on any action, and film must be a challenge. You can either completely rewrite the story of La Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another time, or puzzle the bust line of the old girl with unintentional details. The latter is what has been tried here, and if I may say so, miserably so. Unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets of personalities such as religious ialban in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones destroy the intention of history and betray a serious lack of talent in the filmmakers. As history's famous climax approached, I had completely lost interest. This is the kind of movie where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background.
