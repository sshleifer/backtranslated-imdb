I watched all three crazy max movies in order for the first time a few days ago and were left bitterly disappointed by the third installment. It destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a storyline that makes the apocalyptic Australian wasteland a comical sandbox that one would expect to see in a children's fairy tale movie. the character of the max is unrecognizable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the earlier films and changed to a predictable uninteresting savior who made me feel betrayed. If you haven't seen this movie yet, simply don't. Let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful one and a half hours. (spoiler alert) The other big problem I had with this movie that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. we had already seen him in the road warrior, where he had helped max and yet when he reappeared in thunderstorms, it looked as if the two had never met. whether he should be another person or a relative of the road warriors gyro man, I do not know. but it was not explained and is a weak element in this general weak film. 2 out of 10. Don't get 1/10 due to the thunderstorm.
