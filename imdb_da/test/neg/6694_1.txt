This show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unfunny shows I've ever seen. While humor was subtle and I am all for the subtle humor; The jokes were just not fun. The show is about two kiwis in the mid-thirties living in New York and trying to start their music career. <br /> <br /> I saw the one episode where Brett leaves the other kiwi behind under a curl. Okay, the idea of ​​the idea has potential; but I got the feeling that half of the episode was just filler, and the other half was actually important to the story. What I mean is that they continued to explain how the one left behind felt betrayed and had much distrust of the other guy. I have an advice for the authors: mention it once for the idiots who cannot figure it out in the way he acts and continues. <br /> <br /> And I found the signs annoying. The character who left the other behind, Brett, came across as being too innocent and naive, the abandon that walked around, spoke in this monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was the band leader, was apparently incompetent, but he was the only sign I liked. He is also the one who has got the show a star rating. <br /> <br /> All in all, a show, I have no plans to ever see again.
