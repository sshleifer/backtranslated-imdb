This is actually a spectacularly bad movie, but it is the rare kind of badness that is endless, compelling entertaining! I would like to add to the other comments on this movie. <br /> <br /> "Rock band" on the plane resembles three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bath wigs. Look for the serious continuity problem with the child's full tiger: it becomes a lion, a leopard and back again; it is dirty or clean depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The full tiger turns into a real animal to save the child and the authors! <br /> <br /> The sight of little Jimmy floating down the Amazon in a coffin, sticking his stuffed tiger and flushing away will hold onto your memory. <br /> <br /> Listen for one of the most eerie sound effects ever: late in history, as the pastor goes out to find Jimmy, the wizard requires his monk's clothes to pay - the priest falls on a knee in an immediate dismissal and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "bean" of a bell, but the "ding" of a bell from a boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is an absolute hope to see.
