When you look at the cover and read things about it, a completely different type of film comes to mind than what you come here. Then again, I might read the summary of the second movie called "Mausolem" instead, as there were two films of this title that were released at the same time with both of those that had key elements in common. But reading things about the movie here I know I saw this and not the one and that film is even less what one could imagine that a movie with that title would be about. I want to be honest, I expect more of a zombie type image and you get it in this movie to some extent. However, there are several things that involve the occult and strange forces, as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest. The film also has the old theme for children who go somewhere they do not belong to, have some crazy party, in this case it is actually a mausoleum. The other movie I don't think really has the key feature that plays the prominent role in the movie and I see the point for this one is higher too, it was still not the movie I was expecting.
