One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the movie screams "AMATEUR". For a movie set in the 1800s, everyone speaks as if it were the 1990s. The action, especially the people who play the white slave slaves, is horrible. After approx. one hour in this movie I went out. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better movie on this subject, see Steven Spielberg's far better "Amistad".
