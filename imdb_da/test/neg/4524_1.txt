What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> Being a die-hard fan of the original series (starring Don Adams) really pleased me. Poorly fool me. These are silences and more brain death than a monkey's bottom. <br /> <br /> Saying it was bad would be a serious understatement. It's / was the worst movie (well first 30 minutes of one) I've seen for a long time. I couldn't stand more than the first half hour and preferred to see my hard drive de-fragment. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate bad ... bad is O.K., sometimes even sweet. BUT up with the confused Hollywood crap (and it must be the worst for many years), I will not put up. This movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five-year-old daughter could have written better - and she's not even dyslexic !!! I'm really tempted to try to see the rest of it, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making pizza dough and seeing it rise. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I'm buggered off! What a scam! As Mel Brookes once said; "T-shirt!"
