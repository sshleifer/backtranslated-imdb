Of all the movies I've seen, this, The Rage, has to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot script and dialogue made me cry in pain. "How could anyone come up with something so crappy"? Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but it's a safe "W" movie. (W = waste). For example, about two dozen FBI and local legal officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagon. Inside the jeep is the MA and is "confused" for why all the police are about. Within seconds, a big gun follows, the MA is killed right out. The police are blowing away at the jeep with gary and the company bursting at them. Cops fall as dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and is not hit by a single ball / pill. The MA is killed and gary doesn't seem to notice that that guy is tough. Really a miracle, not since the six-shooter had 300 balls, there has been such a miracle.
