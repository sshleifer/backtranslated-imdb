The extinction of this demented left-wing trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the author's genius from all recognition, introduces hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary into every conceivable place, and even deserves somewhere in the eighth circle, tenth Bolgia with the rest of the counterfeiters. Sandow Birk has reserved a place next to it. <br /> <br /> Stocking with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, not to say anything about extreme liberal bias. However, it is unoriginal, boring and trivial. Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical revision is at least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite his contradictory contradiction opposite. <br /> <br /> I could have eaten a reel's video tape and PUKED a better movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I lost sight of this insult to the concept of poetry itself. Calliope will cry forever.
