I have seen many Japanese horror movies and I have to say that some of them are really interesting, but they are all pretty much the same. this is no exception. The ghost is a black-haired girl who scares it, is sacrifice by not doing anything but walking and looking dead. The difference is just the motive for hunting. the rest is the same as every time: the black hair girl, strange things happen with some media (photos), scary action. While I was watching this flick, I constantly found myself asking why I was wasting my time seeing things that someone else has done so much better before. some scenes where pretty good though, i give it 3 out of 10
