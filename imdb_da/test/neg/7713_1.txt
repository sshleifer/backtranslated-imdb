I am furious! It's been a while since the last zombie movie I've seen, so I was really looking forward to seeing a good Olympic zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A fair story, but horrible plays, movie recording, dialogue and nauseating clich√©s and strokes. I didn't even see the first one that was probably worse than this one ... now I'm curious about how bad it could have been! The movie is full of bugs and goofs. Who on earth is analyzing DNA using a blood test? Why are these "special forces" who "have been in hell and back" struggling as spoiled 6 year old girls? We see gigantic zombies that would take a bite with every chance, so they get hundreds of those who bend their weapons by our two "heroes", take them to the ground, let them go without even a scratch. I could go on with this, but life is too short, and I've been wasting a couple of hours watching this pathetic film that is an insult to the film industry.
