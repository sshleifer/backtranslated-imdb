OH GOD! After having such a promising start, the Critters 2 Karmic rule repeated what goes around, coming around. It was clear that very few things were thought out when this movie was made and what was there with Scott Grimes wearing an ear! This should have been the last expedition in the Critters saga, but more waste was coming. This was the big reason I didn't look at Critters 3 and why is every bad movie series having an episode in space? (Critters, Friday 13th, Leprechaun in Space, Hellraiser, etc.)
