When you look this out and in some seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl will be a "model" and two-run to the nearest ice cream shop and have a low-fat sundae. /> <br /> I was trying to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show competition. No other "famous" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on, I have come to the conclusion that this is sad that many people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women should not see this, teenagers should stay clear of it unless they make book reports on the subject. Many women try to make room to compete for "America's Next Top Model". They live together, cat fighting together, crying together, getting meaningless modeling shots with meaningless modeling of people and fashionatas and eliminated, and almost everyone claims, "You want to see me again". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to those who actually won. <br /> <br /> This is the dream of some girls and good for them. When I see this, I hope the other girls who see this and run like Hades the other way - like college. I just happened to see more of this recent season due to "drawn" in full figured models participating in the group. It made me think more about this as a sorry many people. The "full figures" were no more than average ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they have ever chosen - so of course it would make them look even cooler - a "ploy" modeatas uses the whole the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, "America's Next Top Model" is not about "full figures" models. It's about projecting a pictured image, a beauty that can be marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to be added to the mix. Therefore the name of the show. This excuses many judges, photographers, associations. Therefore, Tyra and her consistent "this was I" plug all the camera angles you can get. But then again, that's the only thing I like about this show - the ex model gives others who wouldn't have the chance - a chance to get into the doors. But after that ... everything else is the status quo for that industry, so there are no surprises or the week of the week's interest in the program.
