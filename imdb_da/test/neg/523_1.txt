This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen (nothing with or with Pauly Shore). I couldn't believe a movie could actually be that bad! Coolio must be the only worst actor (again, not including Pauly Shore) to ever "star" in a movie. The deadline for hitting the STOP button in this movie was huge (in fact, if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR, I would have been inclined to press it). <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and do something more interesting than watching this movie, like watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV.
