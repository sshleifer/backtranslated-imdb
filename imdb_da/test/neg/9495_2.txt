I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, without having read any of his book, but I never imagined him as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the straight guy or Jack from Will and Grace would easily fit in with the role Nick Mancuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show Paris Whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on sofas in the living room. What? They can't afford a room? I found it sweet that Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty and taking care of the soldier's needs. <br /> <br /> The movie was just an excuse to show many breasts - and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) might be interested in seeing him in another role as Inspector Marais.
