Even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and I detest them --- would be hard pressed to find any profit in this abysmally bad travesty of a movie. Perhaps inspired by the "101 Dalmatians" with its clever and loyal dogs, its stupid and incredible people and its absurd "happy" and predictable ending, the alternative title "101 turkeys" jumps in mind. It will almost cover everyone involved in the unfortunate production. I dismissed it as part of the Hollywood perversion from the British Customs before I learned, for my horror, that it is actually a Canadian movie performed in Victoria BC, the fake British amusement park in a city while sucking the treasure money out of Ottawa ON, as fake pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the way it is bad. The dizzying plot? Asinine script? The gloomy notions and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly wise animals? The endless clich√©s and predictable slapstick? At other thinking, I also do not have those surfing IMDb time for a complete catalog of its errors. Still, I should explain its benefits, this room remained empty. Believe me, it's bad; a signal monument in the huge pantheon of truly awful (Canadian) cinema. If you've seen it already, my condolence. If you do not have it, stay away from what you would like the SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Do not even let your children see it, for their little mind to be skewed by the more tiniest minds of those who financed, produced, and filmed this frightening folly. Maybe tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with scary captive animals jumping from the bedside table while flying in frightening flight. I hope so. It will be far far better to do than to see this beastly banal boondoggle. But then I may dream that I had to see it another time, and the sheer terror and cold sweat of it makes me want to stay open all night and shake off the possible opportunity to see it again even as a bad dream . I can even find something worth seeing instead. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" Maybe the instructional video for my built-in vacuum cleaner.
