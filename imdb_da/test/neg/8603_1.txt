Daily Mail's Christopher Tookey had some options to say about this movie, among them "see it all through the 82 unfortunate minutes, and I guarantee you shake your head and ask," Have we really fallen into this? "Yes, we have, because if ever a movie testified to the complete cynicism, taste and moral corruption of those who order and make British films, it is this abomination. "Tookey continues" targeting us with unwashed underwear, dirty minds and bones grazing the pavement as they go, this sex comedy is so sordid, unfunny and illodorous that it's enough to turn off sex and actual movie for life ", Before concluding that "The sex life of the potato men is not just a really scary movie, it is symptomatic of a new national culture with immediate self-sufficiency, yobbishness and sadism now being celebrated on the screen." this case was Tookey bang on the money.This movie goes beyond bad, it actually goes beyond being just unfunny and goes into a bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute draws on for an hour and where the definition of "hilarious 'seems to be' say twice in a Brummie accent '. It is depressing for anyone with a half brain that grew up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. Seen, sex life of the potato men would have disappeared quietly after its cinema release and joined the equally serious Vix-spin-off The Fat Slags (2004) and the bad-star All Saints Vehicle Honest (2000) in the celluloid cemetery, but as it looks to be endless for night screenings and misunderstood "best movies ever!" raves from people who should know better, so I have to apologize in advance to try to correct a mistake that the British film industry has in all its wisdom caused world. Yes, I am very sorry to bring this back from celluloid death, but I actually remember thinking "It can't be as bad as the critics said it was" ... but as God is my witness, it was WORSE . <br /> <br /> Works - dire from start to finish, special mention to Mackenzie 'Albert Steptoe's legs on a young man's body' Crook. <br/> <br /> Soundtrack - cutting and inserting the "ladrock" mainly shell-based stock-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle that brought back horrible memories of seeing these chirpy cocks making Lambeth Walk a dimmed imitation of specials knots -shines Madness on every single comedy / black program in the eighties ... and 'Ace Of Spades' by Motorhead as the title music? What the hell ... trying to evoke remembrance of one of the most exciting exciting scenes ever offered by The Young Ones, actually ever offered by any comedy show? Cheap shot, far below the belt. Script - written by a 12-year-old who has just read every single release of Smut and Zit in a long Red Bull-fueled session ... SURELY? Isn't it a real, proper, secular, adult who might be able to set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fan participating in such a high-level pile of air-blown cinematic excrement? 'One of the brightest British comedy stars'? No more is he not! As far as the League of Gentlemen is concerned, I give myself a pair of boots and boots and Steve's face as a coincident rectum 'Pemberton' and a long weekend in a soundproof room before I die ... PLEASE ... <br /> <br / > Cinema, British or otherwise, just doesn't get much worse than this. Kent Bateman's The Headless Eyes (1971) is a new wave masterpiece in relation to this conflicting dirt.
