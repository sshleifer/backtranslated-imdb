I watched this movie on video the second night and found myself lingering throughout this uninspired snooze test. First of all, one of my biggest pet is peeves when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. It's a THRILLER! Get it right! It has no monsters or anything supernatural. It is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer (In fact, there is a very small body count, so it's more of a serial torture movie, and it did a good job of torturing me.) The basic prerequisite for a man to lure teenagers into his house of horror through online chat rooms could have made a great movie, but we only see him lure a couple of teenage girls over the internet at the start of the movie. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective birth, and he becomes emotionally involved in the case. The movie quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly boring detective and the psychopathic captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks played adequately by author / producer / Twisted Sister frontman, Dee Snider. The occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one-liners on the positive effects of pain and the like from Snider are ridiculous. If he tries to get people to subscribe to these statements through this movie, he fails miserably and (unintentionally) makes light of them. The director of John Pieplow (whose only previous direct action was Jurassic Women, which I will let the title speak for themselves) was uninspired, and there was something wrong with editing, which resulted in the film being unaffected by a few scenes completely independent of plot, unless the manuscript is erroneous (which is quite possible.) This movie a totally unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass as a horror movie that is only performance made me fight at the sight of a pair of graphic body piercings. If you see it in your video store, don't waste your money, but if you need something to laugh about one night and Strangeland is on cable, then you might as well see. 3 out of 10
