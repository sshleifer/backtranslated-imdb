I seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out but had avoided seeing it over the years. I wish I had waited longer. Maybe this movie was fun in 1988, I don't know. I was younger then, but it didn't seem like the world was different. Michelle Pfeiffer, lovely as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the landscape, but empties it into her cheeks as a gerbil to save for later. Dean Stockwell is as convincing as a mob boss as James Gandolfini would be as the main dancer for Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine showed the most pronounced case of delayed puberty I've ever seen. All in all, it's not bad enough to make you pick your eyes out with a melon ball, but it's not far away.
