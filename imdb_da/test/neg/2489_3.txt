There is no real story, the movie seems more like a fly on the wall drama documentary than a proper movie, so this piece may itself be a spoiler. Teen drama about 3 young Singaporean children (very similar to British chavs), playing truant from school, running with gangs, going into battles, insulting people on the streets, getting tattoos, hanging around doing nothing, etc. Generally, they imagine being tough And so often shouting challenging rap chants into the camera. Filmed in MTV style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, close close-ups and animation intervals. The dialogue could have been sharper in Mandarin and Hokki's original languages ​​than in the subtitles, and I have no doubt that some of the contemporary Singapore references will glide over Western heads as well as the cultural and political context, unless of course you are familiar with Singapore . This kind of teen movie can be a first for Singapore, but it has been done before and done better in other Western countries, La Haine (1995) for example.
