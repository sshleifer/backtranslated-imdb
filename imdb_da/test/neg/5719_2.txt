Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson has so brilliantly shown in his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, it is quite possible to make good movies, even great, within the heroic fantasy genre. The genre has diverse literary antecedents dating back to the medieval chivalric romances, especially the Arturian legends drawn by Tolkien and other writers. "Lord of the Rings" apart, but it is difficult to think of other swords and sorcerers, which are something good. I agree with the reviewer who said the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard's 'Willow' and even it did not get much difference than being a mere mediocre movie as opposed to a bad one. However, "Red Sonja" cannot achieve the even more modest difference in being simply a bad movie as opposed to a terrible one. <br /> <br /> As with `Willow ', many of the` `Red Sonja' 'plate elements are derived from the' Lord of the Rings'. An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artifact with supernatural forces in order to achieve a world domination ambition, but is counteracted by an assorted group of heroes. The film, set in the hyboric age, a barbaric era in the distant past of the earth, begins with the villain of the play, the wicked queen Gedren, who makes unwelcome sexual advancement to the heroine Sonja. When these are rejected, Gedren (not a woman receiving a response) responds by killing Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985, it was probably still considered politically correct, not only to make the overall villain a woman, but also to make one of the main motives for her rogue frustrated lesbian desire). <br /> <br /> The next step is to capture Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green football with magical powers, by slaughtering all the sharply-clad female priesthood responsible for protecting it, just as they are destroying it. because they feel their powers have become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving relative. Sonja herself, however, has not been inactive, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she completed the sum of cum laude and goes out to avenge herself. Along the way she walks with Kalidor, a heroic wandering sword king, resembling Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the pampered childhood man of a kingdom who has fallen to the powers of Gerd, and Falkon, Tarn's loyal servant. The rest of the movie is pretty predictable when Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the uncontrolled Talisman. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so bad? Well, that play, for a start. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the kind of typical wood poker-faced performance that became his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, complete with heavy foreign accent. Compared to Brigitte Nielsen as the hero, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language problems delivering each line of the mechanical voiceless voice to one who has just completed lesson three of a "learn-self-English correspondence" course. One wonders if she was hired for the role of making Arnie look good in comparison. The other characters who do not make their own private battles against the English language are simply comic strips, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most uncomfortable screen children ever. An even worse mistake than the bad play, however, is the film's almost complete lack of imagination. This is a particularly sharp flaw in a fantasy film, as movies of this genre rely on their imaginative power to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a stunning plot. When we see Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can persuade us, at least for the next three hours, that we are in the Middle Earth, that rivers, wizards and hobbits exist, and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of a magic ring. When we see `Red Sonja ', we are convinced of nothing except that we see a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting each other on a hill to have a lime-green football. <br /> <br /> This lack of imagination even begins with the movie's title. British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, when he challenged the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was no point in creating a fictitious alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were to destroy the effect of calling hero Joe. (Certainly, Tolkien was able to get away with giving the name Sam to one of his protagonists, but that was because Hobbits were supposed to be comforting acquaintances, the Middle Earth equivalent to the tweedy pipe - smacking Englishmen). Likewise, giving a hero's heroine an apparently long barbaric age, the name of a common girl as "Sonia" (which is how the name "Sonja" is pronounced) is about as appropriate as calling her "Betty" or "Mary- Jane '. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they were bothering at all. Fantasy must be made convincing or not at all. It was clearly shot in a distant mountain area with little or no attempt to propose a distinctive culture. Of course, the few buildings we see, such as the Talismans Temple or Gedren's Palace, are cheap sets. We learn that Tarn's capital has been destroyed by Gedren using the power of Talism, but we do not actually see this event; All we see is what can be a thunderstorm that takes place on the other side of a hill. First, you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when you see how small an army Gedren has at its disposal, it becomes more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if it is Talisman at work or just a crew member who inadvertently leans against the set. If we can enjoy this movie for nothing else, at least we can enjoy it for its unintentional humor; a good example of it so bad- it's funny movie cabinet. Ed Wood would have been proud of this. If it had been shown on California television the night before the recall, Gray Davis would still be governor. 10.2.
