Oh my ... bad clothes, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80s are left with revenge in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, hell of the infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and short-term director (sky-sky for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti. Marketed as a sort of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (called "La Casa" in there), Witchery delivers some modest goreves and bad plays. <br /> <br /> A blend of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, cluelessly shifts the movie from scene to second without letting some serious wood actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups lower the progress to expected ending, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look of her face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti manages to gather some excitement and air of evil into a few - very few - scenes; Unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> The positive pages are experienced when doing the tab. This department is quite efficient and entertaining in the classic latex and red paint style of the 80s Italo-Gore, when things were made 100% handmade and as shocking and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only see with sadistic joy and grinning all the over-the-top ways that unpleasant characters (and actors) were missing and abused one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently hadn't been charged to try other than the good old obsessed girl / woman role ever in her career, or it looks like he is checking out his filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much more to tell and even less to tell about. Don't expect too much when using a rainy afternoon with this, and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. It also helps if your rat's little heart pounds in tandem with the 80's euro horror. And there is talk of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff been skewed by a large metal object and softly wrapped around the room and corridors MUST be one in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
