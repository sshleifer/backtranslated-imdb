Not being a special fan of westerns, I saw this first and foremost because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than a "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show" type role. Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a salon in the Arizona Territory in 1868, who is getting married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger.) The ball's performance was OK - nothing really more than that; she didn't knock me off. I managed to make the role very different from what I used to see her in. There was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, even though the film was trying to maintain a gently entertaining feeling throughout. (A typical fun line - "There are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows any of them!") I didn't find the story all that convincing, though I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of Indian agent. There are typically shootout action and many horses - your typical western in other words. As for Christine - we can quite rightly guess from the beginning how her planned marriage should end is just a matter of how she gets there. If you like westerns, it would be quite typical, with a little humor thrown in. If you are not big on the genre, it is missing. I'm not big on the genre. 3.10
