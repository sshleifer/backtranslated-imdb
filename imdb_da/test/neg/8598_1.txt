The rude so-called comedy I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Not a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dry Twin Town <br /> <br /> Vegas I; as usual but this script is so profoundly so predictable as good English in the worst way (in recent years the English films have been terrible to them all) Ireland has at least produced the commitments, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 stand out with big movie and Wales had Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days of Dolwyn, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood etc <br /> <br /> The comedy is paint with numbers, the actors are dead men who go because there is no characterization and no originality, and it is just so unfunny <br /> <br /> England is falling no matter how many nasty north films they produce. It is the old class system that destroys English films. The Oxbridge candidates spit endlessly clich√© scripts on working class people they have never lived with. It's pathetic. Monty Python was not fun, nor anything from Oxbridge. Let the guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the work class people and the real talent coming through the system take over properly and the British and English film industries will rise again What Next Prince Edward Writes A Modern Oliver Twist?
