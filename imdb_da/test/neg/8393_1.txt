If it is an art and essay film, there is not enough art, not to mention the essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's not enough thriller. <br /> <br /> If it is a teenage drama, there is not enough drama, and for teenagers there is not enough NOFX and too much Nino Rota. I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie, but there is no Tony Hawk, so I think I've been cheated: it's not Tony Hawk's biopic. <br /> <br /> If it is an action movie, it lacks explosions, which would have interest in it, or at least would have made jumping those sleeping in their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it's a movie, there's not enough plot. If it's not a movie, it will be too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, yes ... it's an album I don't want to buy
