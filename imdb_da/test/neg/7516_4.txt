Do you know that they will blow up the moon for real? And in Geneva, there is the debated project that can lead to a possible time machine. All I can say about this movie, based on facts about the future (at the time of film) scientific projects but genuine. Hope the moon will exist does not happen as in the movie. Now about the film itself, I also saw the original film, and I also read the book. The book I did not like, but the film yes. I totally agree with a previous comment that this film was depressing, unlike the 60s. It was very good with force, it was just a parallel future for what is good movie.
