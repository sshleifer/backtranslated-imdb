Much of the comment on this forum is about discussing the validity of a comparison with R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget all that ... This movie - is - home movie is absolutely horrible. How can anyone with a credibility principle claim this as 10/10? There is no plot, none. I couldn't believe that I was using money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had been fooling myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some kind of movie festival blurb) had potential. The only thing I really remember was that it was unbelievable that one of the annoying protagonists was apparently knocked off with a bullet to his head ... and he ended up surviving the wound and making it the final credits alive. Wow. And, Killers has a successor. Double wow. True story - In fact, I was in so much denial that I had wasted my money and vitality on this rental that I kept the video tape for what should have been six months. I kept telling myself that it never actually happened. The video on top of the television was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-suffering. After someone pointed out that it was really right and that I needed to grab, I decided I could not just leave it there. I thought, "How many others have I refused to suffer by sitting through this masterpiece by raising Killers for myself?" I had to do it right and return it to hell from where it came. <br /> <br /> As I imagine most of the populous of IMDb would do in a similar situation, I patterned some great courage and drove to the video store ... at 2:00 am. After making sure no one was around, I got out of my car (still running of course), slipped the movie into the dropbox slot and ordered the hell from there never to return. <br /> <br /> I suppose I expected some goons from Hollywood Video Corporate to be looking for me (the bill should have gone up to $ 1,238.67 at that time) so I moved away from the area. But by chance, like Killer's story, nothing ever happened.
