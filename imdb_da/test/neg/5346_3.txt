I just wasted my Saturday night watching this crap! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, from "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick (from "X-Files"), the decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl on the credit; a very reasonable IMDb Rating (5,6); and many good reviews in IMDb. For my overall surprise, the movie is horrible: the characters are poorly constructed; the story is trying to be fun, but it's totally silly; The character of Mercedes Ruehl is incredibly stupid for a professor in Princeton. So I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews and I found that most of them are made by IMDb users with only notification, therefore family members or friends of the cast and crew, or people employed to promote this trash. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "As Retorno" ("Without Return")
