What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you had interest and concentration to see it to the end. I was left speechless because of the incredibly boring story, annoying situations where an American is equal to half or more Iraqis and a boring dialogue. I think if this movie has something to teach, it's probably like, "Don't go with the US or we're going to kick you". Plus, this movie really encourages and voices to kill lots of foreigners, in the name of war. I got the picture of tackling chess pieces out of the board. Except now, it's fast and there's not much to think about. And besides, no character has any spirit; so how can you at all care about what happens to any of them. With the exception of war movie fans without taste I would not recommend it to anyone. There should always be something more interesting to do.
