The movie was horrible. The production company should be obliged to pay a fine to waste electricity that transfers that nonsense. <br /> <br /> There were too many holes in the plot. Why should DOJ send a killer to murder a world leader? If they weren't DOJ, why should they send someone they thought wouldn't do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy, "Who are they guys?" Apparently the instructor does not know either because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They did not behave in any way that seemed to fit as they supposedly were. With the exception of the doctor, none of the signs were particularly convincing or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste money on the electricity required to watch this movie, be free. Otherwise, drive the opposite direction.
