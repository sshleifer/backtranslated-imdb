Just do some research on the production of this film. Something as simple as a Google search. It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the election. It's a good idea, but I'd much rather see a document, not something edited by the Bush administration, and told its reality. The timing of the film's release, its tone and the fact that MS & L promoted it, raised questions about the film's intention. "According to MS & L CEO Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues also deliver key-oriented messages about the war in Iraq to certain constituencies," wrote Eartha Melzer. "Was the left-wing art house one of these constituencies? Is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagate the American population? No one involved in the film is willing to say who originally put the money to the movie or how they ended up being represented by the army PR firm. "
