Dennis Quaid makes it hard to prove to us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a stupid guy. And he does too much to prove it. TV sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white footage. Music is also nice because Mr. Lewis himself sings. But the rest is just Hollywood B-Movie style, with the fifties Happy Days complex. I think the only good thing in this movie is to see young Winona Ryder.
