Bled is a very suitable title for this. As you can see, you will feel your life soft from you. The clich√© of horrors is about people who do exactly what they should not (go down in the basement or go up to the ceiling). Then the problems are okay. Take care not to watch this movie. Show the brains that victims of horror movies never keep you free Don't go in. And if you need more incentive this movie? is as bad as the worst Uwe Boll movie I think the dead houses are bad. I have often thought of writing a review of a movie on I.M.D.B. and after seeing some based on the comments in it, I discovered that everyone was attracted to his opinion. Please trust me in mine
