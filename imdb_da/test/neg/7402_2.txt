Dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and high budget. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it ... but it is not. The only good thing is the special effects that are very well done, but as in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> It is poorly written, the manuscript trying to comply with genre rules with standard voltage / love story elements, but there is no depth or originality at all. It is far below average. The next thing: It is also badly directed. It has this unattractive TV-directing style with lots of close-ups and wanna-be-great-action in quick editing where there is actually no action or excitement. The actors are not bad, but there are no achievements that touch in any way. <br /> <br /> I don't know ... of course they are trying to make a typical TV movie and not a movie to the cinema where it's always good to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why are they trying to meet typical commercial Hollywood rules? It really feels like the scriptwriter made a weekend class with some American scriptwriting guru and then delivered that mess. Is there no manufacturer responsible for the project who is interested in dramaturgy / visual style or simply in those magical cinematic moments that make some television movies great?!? Do they think a television audience is stupid and does not need a high-quality movie experience? Downfall was a very good example of a good TV movie, but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with this, rent "downfall" instead ...
