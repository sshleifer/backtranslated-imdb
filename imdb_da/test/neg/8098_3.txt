When a group of businessmen begin to die in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is awarded the case. As the deaths continue to mount, Mr Martin obviously does not have much success. At the end of the film, the strange truth is revealed, which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> One of the other users commented on this state "This is a classic movie and it must be enjoyed and not picked apart". I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with this opinion respectfully. It is only "classic" because it is old, not in any way with respect to its quality. I've enjoyed very low budget "B" movies from around this time period, but it's not one of them. The pacing is tirelessly slow, the camera's work is quite boring, most of the play is right wood (even Lugosi is not big in this in my opinion) and the plot, while having an interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult way to follow.
