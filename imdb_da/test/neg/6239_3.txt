Don't watch this movie, see something else ... I was very disappointed, I can't judge this movie better than 3. The action was quite good and I really liked William Dafoe as the villain, but I can't see why this one movie made it to the big screen. The story was old and has been shown in 100+ other movies and 1000+ TV shows / movies. The main problem was basic: nothing happens. Take a kidnapping, let the villain make the kid of the kidnapped man deliver the money, make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes, you have your "Clearing" movie. The only 2 reasons I did not rate this were 1 a) Dafoe and b) "Plan-B ending". There are not many inferences you can give a kidnapper movie ... 75% of this kind end with the end A, the 20% end of B and 1% end up with something unpredictable. Boring, boring, boring.
