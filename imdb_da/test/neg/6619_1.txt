I haven't really got this movie because I'm not perverted like you in lesbian stuff. The girl in the red wig tries too hard to be fun (her lips are so silicone!), But she is really boring and insecure. She tries to come out like a surfer guy (better than dressing slutty, but still strange and absolutely outdated); The film does not explain why she is trying to act as a man. Oh, right, that "get" the poor, stupid girl. I forgot. She makes all those stupid inventions that aren't fun, and she's a really miserable actress. Plus, it looks like it is! <br /> <br /> This stupid blonde girl from Melrose Place plays (surprise) a stupid blonde. <br /> <br /> She thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! They even do! Ewww! I think that part was kind of fun.
