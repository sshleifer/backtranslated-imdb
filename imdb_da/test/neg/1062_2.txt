It's as if Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters was reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and takes revenge on a rival's pregnant wife! If you see an overweight Hauer hunt, a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the excitement of the spine in that competition), sounds good to you, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what an Iraqi POW looks like after six years of imprisonment, then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line for a prison in Baghdad. Overall, "Tactical Assault" bets 2 stars instead of 1, because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is amazing. Mitchell burns up on the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane is burned up in itself (by an enemy missile), after which the movie loses which little enchantor it should begin with.
