Some describe CALIGULIA as "the most controversial movie in their era. While this is debatable, it certainly is one of the most embarrassing: virtually all major names associated with the film made an effort to renounce it. Author Gore Vidal The defendant actually (with mixed results) to get his name removed from the movie, and as the stars saw the film, their reactions changed from loudly disgusted to strategic silence, what they wanted, of course, was to go away. /> <br /> For a while it looked as if it could be. CALIGULA was a large cash register and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theaters to get it screened at all) and even though the film was released on VHS to the domestic market, There were so many censorship issues that it was edited, and the edited version was the only one available for more than a decade, but now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited "R" and original "Urated" versions And undoubtedly John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say that it is something that DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE that Fellini has an off day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation for bankrolling the project and luring the big name stars - and then threw most of Vidal's script and brought softcore director Tinto Brass. So when Guccione felt Brass's work was not explicit enough, he and Giancarlo photographed Lui hardcore material on the veil. Viewers who see the edited version are wondering what all that is about, but they see the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves nothing to the imagination. There is a huge amount of nudity and it remains in the edited version, but the original comes with XXX scenes: There is very explicit gay, lesbian and straight sex, kinky sex and a grand orgy complete with dance Roman guards thrown in good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation of the order of the day. In a particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly cut to death, a woman is urinating at her body and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary accompanying the DVD release, Guccione says he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula - and the little we know is in doubt. Being aside, orgies and casual sex was not common to the Roman community, where infidelity was an offense punishable by death. And surely old Rome never looked like the strange, slightly oriental, strange space age and costumes offered by the designers. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, these sets and costumes are often stunningly beautiful, and although cinematography is commonplace, it at least makes them fair; The score is also very, very good. The most successful member of casting is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathy as Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also avoid in fair shape. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice for him he has little to do with. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark fascination, but in the end it is a weird, more interesting for its design and flat-out curious than content. Some of the bodies shown (including McDowells and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography ... but then some of them are so unpleasant that they might drive you to abstinence and the bloody and movie's grotesque character undermines his eroticism. If you are able to do that, it is worth seeing once, but once is probably enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
