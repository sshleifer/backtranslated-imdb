** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Okay, let's conclude this movie with one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think so? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg leads a special stay consisting of four people who are given a deadly virus again after some gun dealers stole it from a laboratory. They do this by attacking the armmasters in mid-flight and somehow getting the virus back after some fighting. But there are suspicions about Guttenberg, because one of the terrorists knew his name. After debriefing, team members are attacked by unknown people, and everyone begins to suspect that everyone else is involved. After deciding that they can't trust their bosses, they decide to steal the virus once again and try to lure the potential attackers. In theory, this is a plot that could have worked in a low budget film that is just aimed at being broadcast on television. However, the plot is compromised and the film is destroyed in several accounts. First, the plot is quite predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie should end after three minutes. Second. The action is really bad, or the actors are geared to act as dummies. There aren't many emotions, changes in facial expressions at all, etc. I was especially disappointed with Guttenberg, who I think can do so much more, but completely fails in an attempt to be a rough action hero. In addition, even though I am not an expert on the subject in any way, I totally believe that I could gather a better hidden stance by gathering five strangers and training them for a week. This seems to be a theme in the movie to make things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. This also goes to good boys, bad enemies and supporters. Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants about the film. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I did not immediately break. <br /> <br /> Don't know how to conclude this really, but let's say this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in what they do. Sorry, can't be nicer than that. Don't look at this movie, it's not even that bad, it's fun. 2.10
