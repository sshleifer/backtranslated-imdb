There is very wrong with this movie. It can be said that making a sequel to "Halloween" was a bad idea at first, and we should be fortunate that the previous posts, even at their lowest, were still visible. But still, "Halloween: Curse Of Michael Myers" - even today - is so bad, it's shocking. Bad movie production at worst, yes. There is so much blame for walking around. But where to start? Who shoulders rest on this guilt? <br /> <br /> Was it director Joe Chapelle's style-over-substance director? Now the sixth rate is at least fresh on the visual front. And as far as the visual effects go, you will see Michael killing in some rather cruel ways, even though it doesn't quite fit the overall tone of the series. So could Daniel Ferrand's troubled script be the culprit? Well, to be fair, he did the best he could. When you reach the sixth entry into a series, you run out of places to go. Finding a rhyme for Michael's cause is not a bad concept, as much as it is an uninteresting one, especially the way it is handled here. And it really doesn't help that the film was hacked and sewn together so many times that the story was completely lost to the end. Maybe Dimension / Miramax could have beaten it all. Afterall, this was the first studio movie in the series "Halloween" and we all know what happens when too many chefs in the kitchen come. Heck, look at the incredible lows they beat "Hellraiser" for? I guess everyone is guilty because, apart from the actors and the visual effects, guys, no one seems to do anything to deliver a decent flick. However, the bottom line is, no matter how you cut it, cut it, dice it or electrocut it until the head explodes, "Halloween: Curse Of Michael Myers" was never a good movie. Marking an all-time low for the series, almost killing any credibility for Michael Myers, "Curse" is just that: damn it. The tower angle was never interesting, nor was it likely extended. The unnecessary gore is then out of place and replaces the excitement that is the mark of the "Halloween" name. Towards the end, the film stops sensibly, stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and finish the movie before anything else is lost. It's sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance has been immortalized in this movie, though the man did the best he could in the worst possible conditions. And for the most part there are other strong cast members in this movie. Paul Rudd plays the weird, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle quite naturally, while Marianne Hagan does a fair job of portraying the sympathetic female leadership. On the other side of the coin, the reversal of Jamie Lloyd was a shame and thank God Devin Gardner doesn't make any more films. When the child in the movie is pursued by "The Man in Black", Danny is anti-Jamie because he is annoying, whiny and absolutely incredible in his role. It's boring when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I think it's "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. Essentially, this is anti-Halloween, made by a director who did not know what he was doing and a studio that had its own agenda. Hell, though the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the edgy "Halloween" because of the sci-fi twist, but it's just stupid. Save for some good pictures and decent characters, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is almost as bad as it gets. And it comes from a fan!
