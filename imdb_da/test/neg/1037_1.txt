Unless you are interested in seeing 2 hours worth of scenic mountain scenes with hysterical signs, lots of histrionics and cheap 70s (not much of it either), I recommend avoiding this movie. It is long-winded, elongated and has a rather annoying amateur feel to it. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller, shot in an average way, in a beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of slow-paced 1970's movies when there's a plot to delight and entertain you. In this case, it didn't work for me. The plot is thin, intertwined with superficial and stereotypical characters, backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical Italian widow dressed all in black, creeping. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with and familiar with Italy's country side, the movie may be worth seeing as the scene itself is spectacular and pretty breathtaking. However, this movie is nothing excellent, there are much better Italian horror flicks than this. Not much else but a gift party. 5.10
