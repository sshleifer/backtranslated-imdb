The first twenty-five minutes stand out as the worst in modern British film. Director / Adapter William Cartlidge has dealt with Wilde's original with such reverence that he apparently completely ignored the needs of a filmographic audience. Fortunately, the quality of the direction and editing improved significantly after the first half hour, but then the damage has been done. Of the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy dry the floor with the rest of the casting every time they are on the screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, which get enough width to deliver their lines to the true comics that Wilde intended. The ostensible leads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are by comparison lackluster and wood. In an obvious attempt to echo every penny out of a modest budget, the game has been nominally updated for the 1990s, but in connection with the original script, the effect is more of a bad script 1970s TV drama. Real moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive, it is very entertaining - a sign, perhaps that more sensible pruning of the rest of the drama could have led to a better and more uniform film.
