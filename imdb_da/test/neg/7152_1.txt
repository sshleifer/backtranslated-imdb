If this movie comes to a theater near you, consider it a threat. I was unlucky enough to see this movie here in Tokyo. Since I am Dutch, I was surprised to find a Dutch film that played in a big city like Tokyo is. I figured it had to be somekind of special if a Dutch movie does it all to Japan. So I went there with some friends and we are happy to tell the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out, this was one of the most infantile, stupid, stupid, worst acted, worst-spoken English movies I've seen in maybe 10 years, and I left the theater and tried to avoid the staff because I felt almost responsible for this disaster film. Sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was targeting: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting kind of similar movie. Instead, it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. But if I didn't feel too annoyed, the movie was inadvertently quite fun once in a while, as it showed Holland at its smallest.
