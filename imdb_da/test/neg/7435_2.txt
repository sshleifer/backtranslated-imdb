LTL is the kind of formal, hopeless comedy that can be enjoyed by the kind of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember Murray, who promotes LTL at Larry King's crappy CNN show, saying something like "If this movie is not a hit, I stop making movies (or comedies)". He was not as jovial as you could think; he must have noticed that LTL was a safe fire hit and that its error would mean that his status as a star had dropped significantly - that is, a kind of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans to spend their hard earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (The comedy is stupid, not the elephant ...) Or maybe he simply understood during the recording (or when he saw the final rock) what a turkey was so he desperately tried to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding LTL's quality . "Look, it's really good!" Actors are prostitutes living with car dealers. <br /> <br /> LTL is the kind of miserable project that comes from the comedians' "Friends" school; their motto: "If you ever run out of ideas - or if you have never had anything in the first place - then keep an animal in the plot and it will at least inject an element of cuteness". Cuteness = a sad replacement for lack of fun gags. The second motto "Friends" had was: "Always insert a meaningless, boring sentimentality" as this movie so predictably ends when Murray says more pathetically: "What they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to forget this turkey, as I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded of it when I saw a scene from it on TV today (therefore equally meaningless). Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (spoiled as an elephant), but he's not nearly as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey (or yet the man's name spelled); one would think that M.M. would have an easy time playing himself, ie a hick, but he is so painfully unfunny and convincing that I could hardly stand to see him make such a jackass out of himself. It was cringe-worthy. To round off this nonsense, we have the generational X buffoon, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. Then again, everything about LTL is useless ... After LTL, which bombed as far as I know, Murray became more of a "serious actor". What about these comedians and their inferiority complex? It's just about getting prices, ie. "recognition from their peers" (read: voices from their moron colleagues)? This piece of crap marked the end of a series of great and beautiful films Murray made in the early and mid 90s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin", " What about Bob? "And" Ed Wood ". Recently, we have had the immense joy of seeing him in garbage / mediocrity like "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you just can't get away from these "talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers". Compare the two batches. <br /> <br /> A guy described LTL "funny as heck". Now that's the kind of audience this movie had hoped for ... shopping malls and trailer parks ...
