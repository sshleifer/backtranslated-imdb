Every time I think of this movie, I feel physically ill. Reading such a great book and later discovering there is a movie of it was a good feeling. Years later and imagine the joy of turning on the sci-fi channel and finding it starting in just 5 minutes !!! Up go the titles and then owl. If only a few things had changed OK. Everything has changed. Numerous characters are completely removed from new waste they are added to. The main hero has shrunk and outdated by about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend / wife is now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie capabilities. This is really horrible movie theater at its worst. I would rather gladly remove my own toenails with seaweed instead of sitting through another awful view, and I encourage anyone thinking of seeing this - please do not. If you own a copy, it is now burning and thinking how much better your life would have been if this celluloid insult never occurred.
