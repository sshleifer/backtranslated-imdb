This film series of production line planning. It looks like the filmmakers are looking at recent hit movies and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Fly! - ROLL 'EM! - The film deals with the age of the Stewart / Allyson artists However, I am sure we still have to think that they are much younger. There are messages in "Strategic Air Command" I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I stick to a really miserable element: The happily married couple are challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without hearing his wife. In the film's most dramatic scene, she calls him on it. It ends completely unresolved - Allyson cries her heart out on their bed, and Stewart goes out on her. No discussion; he just says he is correct and goes out on his broken wife. For everything he knew, she could split her wrists. <br /> <br /> Later, Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Amazing! <br /> <br /> Stick with Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
