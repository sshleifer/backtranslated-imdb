'Join me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just let it run in the background. chat among yourself and return to it whenever you want and at some point it will end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when I saw it alone, I felt as if I was almost watching the world's top, worst, longest and most drinking sentimental beer advertising, as I almost managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and I (just one) managed a few moments of awakening to witness a 'thank you' to the film sponsors - which included Asia Pacific Breweries. Aha! Methought: How surprising is * that * - given all shots from Tiger beer scattered throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie? <br /> <br /> At the same time, dialogue between individuals with occasional bumps jumps in depth, but all too normal is not said or witnessed any particular progress in the overall history of the film. It is as if you could turn off at any time and return at a later date, and you would really have missed nothing that would have been an inevitable readiness or part of its plot regarding the overall progress of the movie. So the ultimate "wallpaper movie"! I wonder ... Which movie were those who positively reviewed this, and then? I wonder and continue to wonder ... It certainly couldn't have been this arty to the point that was without artillery excuse for a camera that rolled. Explained is that "be with me" must be woven around the "love, tragedy, and redemption" themes. But all I experienced was boredom, a half-baked manuscript with a smattering of spooky text messages, and the only redemption was what arose when this completely useless movie ended. What a wild waste of time, it ended up being! It was also said that the characters in this movie were fictional except for Theresa Chan, who is a "remarkable woman who has defeated adversity ..." Well, no respect for Ms. Chan, but since she was such a wonderful and wonderful character Why the manuscript at all should involve the stories of other characters without the most unpleasant attempt to connect their lives together? Still, it turned out to be an almost inconceivable dreary movie whose highlights included the credits rolling. Instead of tying in the fate of all characters, I really felt that the movie ended up trying the closest impossible and apparently fell between stools, as far as any viewer effort could be concerned. <br /> <br /> I am generally an art-house movie fan and usually do not oppose slow pacing (here there is no shortage, you believe me !!). I hate such movies as 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but consider, for example. Eric Rohmer as a big film producer. So I hope it puts my criticism in a certain perspective. Nonetheless, there was no redemption function at all in the whole film's perception and delivery, which could prevent one's eyes from slowing down slowly, dropping every minute of 'Be With Me'. Watch this movie if you want to waste time. Otherwise, your life would not be richer for missing it. 3.10
