J Carol Nash and Ralph Morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a pianist daughter. When his progress is spun, he injects the father with a disruptive disease, so she will be forced to come to him for a cure. God it is terrible. It is boring and boring, and you will nod off before the pianist gets uglified, I was on the brink. Yes it takes up when things are started, but it is one of the old movies that are better remembered, then looked again. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, it will be late <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
