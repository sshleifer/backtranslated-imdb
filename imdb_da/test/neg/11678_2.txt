The film uses random events of historical significance as a background and willy-nilly crosses the life and timelines of its 3 key characters. For what purpose can you ask? The problem with this movie is that the script becomes "the story", not the character or their life. <br /> <br /> It starts with a bunch of rich, meaningless college kids (and a couple of not-so-too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Business, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, apparently. Only until the heroine strengthens on them. Not once but twice. After a break in the 'Movement', the next hurdle for these 3 is the emergency that Indira Gandhi has imposed on the country. Lots of political figures roam around for no apparent reason. The subplotters are too constructed and do not add up to create a logical whole. The movie tries to impose a false tempo, but never reaches a real rhythm. Barely coherent sometimes there is no maturation and growth at all in the bows of the 3 ex-college friends. Even after they are probably married, fiancé, resident or whatever, they are ever too eager to just ditch everything and go out to a village to get sex with ex-laws or ex-flame. Which fertile imagination the screenwriter possesses. So many words with 4 letters are used without rhyme or reason why it is completely abused! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a horrible American accent that she doesn't try to hide. Its hideous hearing her mundkliché-ridden dialogue as' What's there? I didn't think you would come "(this after the hell of a nightmare she's just been through), or at first I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself. "She invites her friend to have a cup of" South Indian "(no less) coffee, wants a good morning and then wants to be good-natured by someone else in the family. Now what's with it?!? The best actors, the editing is really irregular with too many cuts, obviously trying hard to make a bold claim, Sudhir Misra turned up big-time on this one.
