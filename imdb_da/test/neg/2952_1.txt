The opening scene makes you feel like you're in high school. But I've seen high schools with better plays! Each line was delivered so of course that I felt I was watching actors work instead of seeing characters. I found the sign development to be poor and the action very forced! I found out that 25 minutes in the movie, I really didn't care what happened anymore because the plot was too obvious and I was sorry. I was hanging in there waiting for the movie to redeem, but it never happened. Sister Theresa was far too sweet, even for a nun, but seemed to be impulsive and somewhat manipulative. All in all, I was greatly disappointed.
