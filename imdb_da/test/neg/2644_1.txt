This movie was horrible. If it had never been done, the world would be a better place. Come on a flying carriage now? What did they think? This was a sub film with a horrible hook and I would like a written apology from the studio that produced this, along with some cookies to help pay me for the time I wasted on this crap party that I can never come back. If you pay to watch this movie, I'm really sorry because I watched it on TV on a Sunday afternoon, as I had nothing better to do, and it nearly destroyed my whole week. A flying freaking WAGON?!?! And is it supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own needy needs than her children? No wonder they do not have enough meaning to tell anyone that he is beating them, their mother is teaching them nothing but what she wants is coming before everything else. Absolutely terrible.
