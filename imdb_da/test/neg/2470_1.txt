According to the article at http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the actors in the movie, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this movie for free. She was the victim of an infamous kidnapping shortly before this film was made, and later photos of her in need were published in a magazine that has since been forced to shut down and its publisher was sent to jail. The actress denies that she was assaulted, but there was a movie leaked on the net that allegedly showed she was raped. (The Hong Kong press has, on the basis of respect for her, mostly refused to report the incident, but Google will show some articles about it.)
