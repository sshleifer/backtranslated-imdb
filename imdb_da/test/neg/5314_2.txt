I laughed twice about watching this movie, and if you were wondering, I didn't have a bad day, nor was I subjected to anything else that would have distorted my mind while watching this cinematic stool. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With all this talent, would you believe this would have been at least watchable, right? Wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's play Sucked and don't suck! John Travolta-Very sympathetic. Although of course it was buried under too much makeup, I found him to be fun to watch. Didn't suck. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman - After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this horrible written character. The great moment of this character showed someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn - The White Guy's Role of Role, who thinks he's black, goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered fun? I love the guy, but I want to see him in something better than this. It felt like he was dormant. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Cedric the Entertainer- This guy is good. He delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur (you might guess what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. He was fun and really raised the material he got with his presence. Didn't suck. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel-Sucked due to a welcoming performance. <br /> <br /> James Woods - Sucked but not his fault. In fact yes it was. Reminded me of his role in the Casino for some reason. I don't like manic James Woods, I like to burn James Woods slowly. Victims of bad writing, maybe? Other 3000 Sucked but he went down swinging. I think he has potential as long as he is not led by a hack on his next image. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian - She is absolutely beautiful and of course talented, but this movie is not going to make her a star. Not sucked, but needs a better vehicle for her talents, not hacked. The Rock - This should have been the role that catapulted him to film studios, but as described by F. Gary Gray, is being beaten up. In this movie, Rock projects this charisma that makes him so comfortable that I run up to be sad. He tries really hard and while he doesn't quite succeed, he gets an A + for effort from me. This guy is not afraid to scare himself and go completely against the type, playing a gay bodyguard with the eyes of the star. I really want to see him make it big. He has what it takes as long as he is not controlled by a hack. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to what I feel was the weak link in this production. I might as well come out and say it, don't you? F. Gary Gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea. Wow, that was bad. Who had the bright idea of ​​letting this guy directly? The dealer was good, but what more on his CV did people convince that he was the man for the job? Between his direction and the terrible writing I am willing to chip in for both sinners to get a good lead salad for the knees. Want to see John and Uma dance? I might think of another movie with the two that I could recommend to see instead of this. Not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been okay and it wasn't even "just okay". <br /> <br /> RATING: * out of *****. PS Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is remarkable to mention. Sizzling!
