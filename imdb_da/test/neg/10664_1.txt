In Bollywood, worthless movies are not hits, good movie flops and good actors don't make it big <br /> <br /> AKS is such a movie <br /> <br /> Himesh for a music director and singer tried to play hell man just because his songs became a hit, meaning he became an actor <br /> <br /> Manufacturers were sure the movie might work, the songs were also a hit and of course Himesh made his cheap advertising as usual <br /> <br /> The film tells such a bad story, such a bad direction, such a bad play, it makes you hug. Indian rickshaws in Germany, Stunts by Himesh and many stupidity Himesh's hood is intact, even when in the car as summer results <br /> <br /> The direction is poor Music saves grace, although most songs are heard the same. Himesh tries hard but unfortunately his emotional scenes are a joke, lacking expression, he is best suited to his music director and some singing He cuts a boring picture Hansika is terrible Malika is okay Sachin Khedekar is okay, Dars han Jhariwala ham
