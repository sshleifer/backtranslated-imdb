With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like this, as this terribly eerie action flick must be seen to be believed. William Sanders is rescued by his friend Harry Cotter during a extraction in Vietnam, but gets himself caught by the enemy. Fast forward ten years, and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind-control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan, played to the indecent hilt by Nick Nicholson, who I might not add, not trying to even speak with a Russian accent, but looks more like a petrol station companion in Kentucky with his colored teeth. What is even more absurd is that he was also a dialogue coach for this film. Soon, William will be recruited by the CIA to chase Harry down. He joins Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp, and soon both of them are blowing half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw-dropping horrible that it's wondering why this movie doesn't have more of a cult feeling. Such a scene is the sudden love of the jungle of William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would knit completely naked in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the final theme of Blood on Satan's Claw. No Dead Heroes is the magic ball film campaign all the time, as a shot leads to more deaths. In one scene, Harry punishes his rifle behind a stone and kills seven guys. I had to fasten it and count. It's hard to find movies that have recently received full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silence that comes with it.
