I didn't expect "Citizen Kane" but I was hoping for an extreme, guilty pleasure! The scripture is bad, but the school's outer shots were of course made with the same 5 extras the same day and the dorm's outer shots were easily shot under a hurricane. The wardrobe was swapped around so much, I hoped the wardrobe end had some good strong soaps to wash the panties. I know the time of the budget, but do you think they could have bought a few different styles of underwear? What oversexed up vampiric hot chick would wear tights under latex pants? I was relieved to see a look of thong in the penultimate scene. <br /> <br /> Good points: The actors were all * very * attractive, and the girls had natural breasts. Too bad they never took off the barks. <br /> <br /> The special effects were neither effective and could only be described as special if they saved the short bus to the lifeboat. The last scene in particular is horrible, ridiculously bad. <br /> <br /> -Lizzzzzzzz
