Okay enough Every time I think I've seen a movie that's so misunderstood, so bad in every way that I think no one might find something to praise, I just come to IMDb where I'm met with the usual inane "Undiscovered masterpiece" "GREAT movie" - I honestly mean which movie you are watching people for, it's certainly not the mess I just saw on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD. There are about three entertaining lines, and a plot that gives inconsistency a new meaning. And then it stops after ninety three minutes, and the final credit begins. Then there's another scene. The DVD is pretty miserable, which fits the movie. The source material is almost completely faded into a grimy. It's hard to imagine that this movie came with Get Carter. The critics and the public got this one right back then - it was lambasted and a box-office disaster, and rightly so. But you pundits continue to try. And I keep trying to find a movie that does NOT have anyone raving about it.
