This movie really shows the father and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show you is just one side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children that this film does not show. "Indian parents" are guilty of the following: a. To destroy the child's individuality by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age. Such children grow up to be adults only in physical appearance, but remain children in mind. Since everything has been given to them by their great Indian parents, they don't feel the need to work hard on anything or learn the basics of human communication with other people except their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Native American parents trying to prevent their children from making friends, going out or preventing them from doing everything that is starting to make them grow adults. The reason they do so is the same self-esteem. Indian parents "expect" their children to take care of them when they grow old. They make no savings for themselves and when they reach 50 years ... They cry aloud. We have become old now, and then we depend on you children as we have done the great service to bring you to this world and take care of you and make you intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents at the age of 50 have overdue organs and health and are financially insecure. Most feel that they absolutely do not need to take care of themselves as they "expect" their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> In the west is opposite. People start planning when they are 20 years old, about their retirement, and when they retire, they are financially secured. Indian parents do nothing of the sort since I said they brought the kids into the world and what better investment in that? I am a victim of my Indian parents (I am sure there are countless other Indian children like me) who have grown up physically but still struggle with their lives on their own and they continue to have pestilence 50-year-olds. who cries loudly for HELP all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only one side of the story ..... OUT OF JUNK
