Okay, so when a friend of mine told me he was going to lead MM2 and MM3, I thought I should check out Monster Man and see what it is, maybe I could get it, but when I popped it in my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad, i mean terribly annoying bad comedy from the cool fox he is fun, not to mention how the looooong director used on the meaningless desert road trip , I came to the conclusion that these guys had no idea what they were doing and missed the boat with a long shot. The story had the potential to be somewhat different from the usual BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood Video shelf published by the Lions gate these days, but they've probably boasted this one up. Why put so much time and effort into shooting annoying bad actors and bad jokes, why not shorten the ride and put more of the plot into the movie. Myabe's writing was so bad that they had to cut much of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of horror and made them find filler to make the usual 84 minutes ???? All in all, and I'm easy here, maybe because one of my friends is the bald redneck in the bar scene who gets his skull crushed, when chasing the three leads out into the street, I'll give it at least 1 star to try, and gore / kill scenes were not that bad again, they tried. Too bad, Lions Gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea but failed. I do not recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a cut version where the movie starts from the hitch scene. CRAP!
