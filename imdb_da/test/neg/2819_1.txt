This movie was absolutely garbage bin. The director and the stars (?) Should be relegated from making movies forever. The paper-thin plot relates to a shabby instructor played by the shabby director (now acting it) on the internet advertising for women to steal in a snuff movie. <br /> <br /> There is no laugh at all, the girls look stretched and bored, the direction is meaningless, the music is wrongly placed (heavy metal in a library scene?), and the lighting is terrible. The director should have paid in a few more shopping carts filled with aluminum cans and got a script, sober actors and a few light bulbs. As it is, this is a disgusting, unpleasant, worthless mess on a movie.
