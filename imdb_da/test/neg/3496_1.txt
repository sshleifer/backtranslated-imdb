Through its 2-hour run, Crash charters the emotional anxiety of its 10-point ensemble of characters as it faces the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying American society. That and the emotional anxiety of one of his audiences is close to the front and desperately trying to make sense of which movies have become these days. <br /> <br /> The era we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even though the non-very enthusiastic fluttering of postmodernism is always shot down by what post-postmodernism, which aims to destroy all these ideas, all by no means thanks to the great destructivist ideas of the great ' thinkers'. But I go down. It doesn't have much to do with what the movie is about, but rather what the movie is. It is probably hard to make money in a Hollywood that has to cater for a market that is so post-post all that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think about whether we like it or not. And then a new study product is born! Indie films, once energetic and idealistic in their exciting experimental style, now appear to be as stubborn as Hollywood movies selling to Indian movie markets. An indie film must sell at Sundance before it is "recognized". And then nothing is simpler. Even what constitutes a good movie is so creepy. While in the former filmmakers only wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in these seemingly simplified trials, the greatest movies are worn - filmmakers today have to make movies that are good first and foremost; movies must make people think, must be meaningful, must be provocative, raise questions, yadda yadda yadda. What it is all about is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems oddly similar to the formal similarity to Hollywood movies. The myriad ways to separate from being the same product. <br /> <br /> And I haven't even started the movie yet. Maybe I've been too fussy on movies I see these days. Perhaps because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than to say, it is probed when you watch a movie. But hell, this movie is a big load of crap. And I'm dismissed by this movie, not just because it follows the How to Make a Good Movie Good 101 guide to the T characters, spoken lines, and is as witty as if they were gifted with God's speech; it raises issues of racism and life confronting racism in America; it has 'touching' moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; Not to mention the fact that when you hear the surrounding / new age-gauge of women singing in high-level foreign language records, you know you are in favor of all of the above traits. <br /> <br /> And something about the above point - about raising issues of immediate convincing issues like racism - rejects me the big time. Like all post-post-post all movies, it's not just having a message about this issue. Because oh, our audience is very intelligent for it in these post-post-mail world. Our audience wants us to think, not want us to put things so simple (and then they will go into existentialist screams and say) that is because life itself is not simplified. Ha ha ha. What other joint exercise we do here, so the audience needs to think about problems rather than having them fed with them. Okay, okay and okay. So the movie makes it a point to pound the audience with these non-messages, and since they are not exactly a message, is it so decisively subtle and subtly does it really matter? So we are repeatedly affected by this well-written subtlety with the rhetorical prose eloquence. And, as if the irony is not steep enough, we have the character of Ludicrous, the only character that does not seem to take all these racism discussions seriously, is "transformed" into one of those annoying meaningful characters where he learns something at last, giving meaningful looks and breaks where the audience must "learn something about themselves". Um, yes. How I wanted to see an incredible racist movie right after this man. <br /> <br /> To cut the long stifle card, I suppose I wouldn't have taken the problem with the movie if it wasn't so flashy in its self-esteem. The anxiety that formed the whole movie felt more like a white boy than the actual Spike Lee-ish anger. It's like Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the type who wants to wave flags of humanitarianism when all they don't know is that the flag they are waving is their punched rings. Plus it has become so trendy in the post-post-post world to be quite subtle about it. Nothing is simple anymore. In its best efforts to actually be good, provocative and ultimately human, it has also not become another indie crap from an indie director who wants to make a name out of itself as a credible indie film maker. Now Hollywood is at least more simple and sincere in its manipulativity.
