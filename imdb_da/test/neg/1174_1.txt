I would hate to have someone watch this movie "inspired by a true story" and draw any conclusions about the true event. Few things they got right were overshadowed by the things that just weren't right. Ed Gein has never pulled anyone behind a car, never met anyone in the cemetery and killed them, no evidence he returned body parts to the cemetery. The things he did were terrible enough, why try to make it worse? <br /> <br /> This movie is among my 10 worst waste of waste. "In the light of the moon" is a much better movie on the subject, it is more factual and the play is superior to that.
