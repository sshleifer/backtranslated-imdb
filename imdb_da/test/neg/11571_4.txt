28 years before the 9/11 there was another 9/11 representing a key date in Chile, South America and the world. This was the date of 1973, when a bloody coup in Chile deposited Salvador Allende the first Marxist president democratically elected worldwide and put an end to the Chilean experiment on a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace. Unfortunately, this film is too prestigious and too nostalgic to Allende's time to be an objective representation of the man and his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a controversial figure in the history of his country and the whole world. He was really democratically elected, but his policies threw Chile into an economic crisis. He was deposited by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed by repression and fluttering human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro, who in his policy saw another way of revolutionizing. We never know if his preliminary to building a socialist but democratic society would have been successful. The film's authors take a completely pro-Allende position, there is no point or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions such as why was the middle class opposed to him, or how his democratic views could go hand in hand with support or supported by Castro. The tone of the tone is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandist. People who want a better understanding of this episode of history must wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
