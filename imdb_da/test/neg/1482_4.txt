I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was the friend who worked at the factory with the protagonist and ended up getting his arm smashed in the machine and was screaming (where was the ambulance?) The action in this movie was mostly poor with most local Fox Valley actors. Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. I can be biased but generally I enjoyed it. The sound track was also the band Spooner, which later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played the Swenson man coming to the door of crutches to talk to the police.
