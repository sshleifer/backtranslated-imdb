Mild spoiler in second section. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's noisy first talkie. She and Dressler are similar to the only people who know what they are doing in this movie. The old guy who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the movie is sooo ah-noying !! The only thing he does stumbles around in a completely fake way and shouts of "the old dah-lot sea". He blames Garbo's "past", his entire life and everything on the sea! He comes across as stupid x 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the rough sailor Garbo falls in love with, and he is fine in his role, but nothing really excellent. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Garbo releases her "terrible secret" at Bickford and her father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and strikes his head and fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. As soon as he goes on a tirade about the sea. <br /> <br /> I had to force myself to finish Anna Christie. It is too melodramatic in many parts and creaking. There are many good early talkies, but it's not one of them. If you haven't seen Garbo before, try something else before Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
