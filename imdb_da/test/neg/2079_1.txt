This 2.5-hour diluted snow party seems to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation, ever. clearly having a budget that allows for breathtaking location in Greece, the money could have been better spent drawing up a coherent script with character development and motivations clearly outlined; especially since the bill has gone through the problems of doing so already. The portraits lacked passion and direction, leaving behind the viewer debating whether they should bother to worry about the protagonists' demise. which produces another point - the protagonist of the original work, prospero, is not so named in this rendering despite the fact that most other cartoon names are used. Enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece. In fact, all aspects that have made the scene version of the 'storm' full of marvels and intrigues have been sucked from this summarized version of a self-absorbed, pompous ass that can't figure out how to worry about anything beyond that blur of his wealth and power. Over all, an unimaginable effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration.
