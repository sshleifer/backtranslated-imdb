If you are at home on a weekend, get bored and lack the will to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life in the next few hours, enjoy making fun of this movie. The action and the script and the general film production of this movie is actually not that bad, so it makes it possible to actually sit through it. This is defitnly a movie they would show in high school in class to teach the dangers of pre-sex. Or they could also show it to learn the dangers of very lame music - that "rock" band Brian Austin Green is in, is really terrible, I think it is a much bigger threat to society than unwanted parents.
