I was from Australia and loved the series, I didn't expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I'd see the first episode to see if it was so bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what is there to say. It's nothing special. Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually had some good lines, Molly Shannon is not a good Kath herself. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she talks to all her funny accents (like when she says Yumor or Noice), it sounds like it's just the natural way she speaks, but when Shannon has an accent, is clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or something else to give us something to laugh about because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny. So far, only the first episode has been sent and it is clearly not up to the Aussie version standards, although it was a stand-alone TV show with another name that was not compared to the Aussie version, it might be considered a bit better. But if there's nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), you can't do much harm by seeing it, or better putting some of the Aussie version on it if you have it.
