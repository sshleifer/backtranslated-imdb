Don't watch this movie. In most cases, as for Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the American remake. But this movie was horrible. The ghosts look like a trick or treat dressed as a joke and whisper in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects, and the play is just awful. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained, whereby the film goes from bad to worse. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are more entertaining things to do - like watching paint dry.
