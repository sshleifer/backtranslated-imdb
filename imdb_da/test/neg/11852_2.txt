This movie is sad. According to my colleagues IMDb users use (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR stock footage from the Carnotaur movies. Well, since I haven't seen the Carnotaur movies, I can't say. But I notice some pretty bad edits and even worse plays. This movie is a huge steaming pile of s ***. It makes absolutely no sense. Here's this thing that calls itself a PLOT: Food scientist recreates raptors. Raptors kill people. Sheriff examines. * SPOILER * (although I don't know what it is that I pamper) Sheriff catches up with crazy doctor plans. Army guys are sent in and raptors start killing the army guys. Raptors. Yeah right. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. FX is the cheapest one ever used in a movie. There are a lot of gore. Cheap gore. It doesn't even look real. I would agree with another person who considered this movie that the only thing this movie is about to make is that it ends. There is about two seconds of originality in this movie. And it only comes from when the sheriff talks to some tax agents on the phone about his electricity bill or something. This idea has been used in about 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. Overall, I will give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it ended.
