Sometimes I look back to high school and it amazes me that I never went lower than Marvin did in this BAD movie. Poor Marv is the protagonist, whose accidents just get worse and worse. In spite of his intelligence, he manages to be bullied, exploited, supports his miserable dead girl, and many more goof-ups, including a bold heist, as we say, do not seem to plan. Of course, the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this movie, so all this catastrophic gloom pops out like harmless zeta rays. Recommended for the days you feel down, pop this movie in and you will smile and say "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
