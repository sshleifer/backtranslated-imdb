The only positive thing I can think of in this complete piece of waste is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen was called. <br /> <br /> It would have taken so little effort to make it more reliable ... much more effort and it could have been brilliant though. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously unlikely. <br /> <br /> Making a totally unacceptable movie must have been the point. <br /> <br /> Something else doesn't make sense.
