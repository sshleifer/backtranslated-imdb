Another sadistic and ultra-modern late 70's / early 80's revenge film ?? Wes Craven has probably launched a popular trend with his last house on the left. Although "Terror Express" is more like a rip-off of other rip-offs, like "I Spit on your Grave" and especially "Night Train Murders". Storywise, this movie has nothing new to offer, so the only thing left for director Ferdinando Baldi was to multiply the sleaze factor by a thousand! This is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little rough at the end. At night the train from Rome is three hopelessly imbecile losers running amok. They provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females. Things get a little out of control, and a travel prisoner is going to save a prostitute who keeps getting screwed together by the three. This is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a pair of false blood bags. This type of film is generally notorious for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminatory behavior against women, but the sex of "Terror Express" is not at all disturbing. On the contrary, these "rapes" spend more time caring for their victims and then getting some themselves! The music is amazing, the dialogues are unintentionally fun and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. The bad guys are wimps and the train passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set. If you like your exploitation as fun as it gets, it's your movie. But your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be made. "Terror Express" should be in the porn section of videostore.
