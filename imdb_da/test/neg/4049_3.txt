Despite its high ambitions, Zurlini's film should be seen as a failure. It is one thing to create a world that draws the viewer to feel the tedium and anxiety experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini tried). It's another thing to make a movie that is boring and meaningless episodically. Despite beautiful filmography in an enchanting place - and a wonderful score - the film never entices the audience. Too much is unintentional fun (the fake sound of dripping water in Drago's neighborhoods or, for example, the silent movie that smokes some of the actors) or simply confusing (why will Drago definitely leave the fort?) For the movie to succeed as a coherent occupation.
