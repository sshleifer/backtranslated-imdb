What does Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. do? in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income schools. While the subject is one to be solved, the movie uses every clich√© in the genre and comes out as a textbook popcorn flick. The characters are cuts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even the faculty. See this with your kids when they get 13 or 14. With them, it can be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems. For all the elderly, it will be nothing more than something to see and spit about at 4 in the morning, as I did recently at Bravo. In fact, what did this do in Bravo?
