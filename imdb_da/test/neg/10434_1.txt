I disagree with calling this a stoner movie just because grass also makes a look. I can't imagine this even approaching "stoner classic". It would be like calling singles a "grunge movie". The film certainly goes along with a foam plot. At times, I wondered if the manuscript had either been dropped and mixed, or if they lost it altogether and tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me to see children play-action and make the story up as they go together. The characters are wood, the dialogue is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely interrupted. Who was killed? When? What? And how do you act when your friend overdoses? Complete lack of emotion and complete disconnection from reality. <br /> <br /> Regarding droning guitar soundtrack that comes with each scene: Enough! It was like seeing the opening menu screen, where the same track runs infinitely in the background, either forward or backward. <br /> <br /> I watched and hoped that the plot would somehow fall into order, the actor and dialogue would improve or something, somehow, would focus this mess in a coherent movie. After 112 minutes, it never happened.
