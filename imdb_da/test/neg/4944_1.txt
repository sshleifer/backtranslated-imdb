Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON SCREEN? Are you kidding people? I wouldn't put horrible Molly Gross to play even in school games! Where did these people learn to act? Does some papers borrow from their neighbors actor? Terrible plot, terrible play. Hey ... why are you taking us to an imbeciler? What can I say more. I understand that this is a television production, and the play is not supposed to be the one from Citizen Kane. But nevertheless, they should try harder to earn their money. And apart from what can be said in 10 lines for a simple movie like this? Do you want an article in the morning paper? To say what? Worse movie in the decade? OK, you want it - you got it!
