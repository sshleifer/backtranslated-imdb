I'm a big fan of "Aunt Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She was really the perfect actress to play that character. <br /> <br /> I heard Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in "Mame" but it's hard to imagine any topping Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a great comedienne that her comics saved her performance in this movie where I think she was miscast. They should have dubbed her singing - hear these songs sung at a faster pace and with strong voices changing the whole effect. <br /> <br /> I just saw stage growth in Washington DC, and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame, Harriet Harris - the unpleasant chain agent on Frasier - played Vera, and she was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Both would be good casting for a television movie of this show. Perhaps if that production makes it to Broadway, they will consider filming it. <br /> <br /> I also think Tracy Ullman would be good as Agnes.
