I am a big fan of IKEA to be a very soft movie with a house to set. My entire home is practically packed with the cheap chipboard. And you know how all the stylish household items at IKEA have the funny names - a bookshelf called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called a "Base" - it adds everything to the Euro charm. <br /> As the interestingly named (but terribly translated) topics on the shelves at IKEA, I would like to give some translation to some of the reviews I have read about the Swedish "Power Plant 3714". <br /> <br /> Original comment: "For a low budget film, it's pretty cool. It would be great to see what these guys could do on a Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br /> Translation: The movie is crazy, the lighting is pedestrian, cinematography is uninteresting, the sound recording is hollow. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "David Lynchesque sci-fi drama is in a strange forest town with just as strange signs!" <br /> <br /> Translation: These "actors" work for free, the story is circular and tiring, the ideas that undergo the girl desperately trying to be existential, but are simply earthly, and the settings (especially the interior) are dull and full with ugly wallpaper. Original Comment: "Editing is well done, and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling CGI effects do not have to come out of a Hollywood studio!" <br /> <br /> To begin with, save the imperfections by digitizing all of it on a Mac and mixing vigorously for three minutes. Ingeni√∏s! <br /> <br /> I took a chance on this DVD because I'm a sucker for independent movies, especially those trying to tackle the often expensive and awe-inspiring genre of science fiction. I think some of the best sci-fi flicks from all the time have been realized with little or no budget, spfx and exciting actors. Take Peter Fonda's eco-warning-time-travel flick "Idaho Transfer" for example! A classic. <br /> <br /> But "Power Plant 3714" does not fit the "carefully designed, low-key, idea-dependent sci-fi" category. It focuses relentlessly on characters that don't do much and don't say interesting things. It goes around and around in circles. It's too long (this comes from a great Tarkovsky fan). Worse is its concept of "reality shifting aliens" Twilight Zone feed from 40 years ago. It's just not a well-made movie - and I really wanted it, dammit! <br /> <br /> But when I was the IKEA tab, I made a groundbreaking observation. First of all, everyone who has acted at IKEA how their difficult shopping carts work - all four wheels are multi-directional. The trolleys can rotate perfectly 360 degrees, and it takes a little knowledge to handle them as a pro by any avid IKEA shopper. Now I get cursed, but one of the leading actresses in "Power Plant 3714" goes to an inky-dinky merchant in the middle of heaven and what is she pushing around? A multidirectional shopping cart! So, it's not an IKEA invention, but it's another wonderful invention (let's call it a "tacklebee" for hell of it) from the land of hi-doo!
