Daft potboilers don't come much daft than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that does everything okay. Except in this case, it does not. Based on a sacred novel by devoted Lloyd C Douglas (he wrote "The Robe"), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it has more upliftment than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for widowing Jane Wyman but is later directly responsible for the accident where she loses sight. To do something, he takes medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, it wasn't that stupid, he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). In the meantime, they fall in love. Try as I may not really find the redeeming social commentary and criticism of American Moors who should lie just below the surface of Sirk's movie (this one is not too deep). On the plus side, Rock Hudson is not half-bad (I think I will rediscover him) and of course it looks good (in Sir's movie, people live in space, the size of cathedrals). Nothing in this movie matches the best of his later work and even in soap opera terms, it is definitely daytime television.
