This movie actually hurts to see. Not only did I laugh, I ended up getting a serious headache. At times I felt so sorry for the actors involved. The best way to summarize is to note that among sex comedies it is probably the least fun and least sexy all the time. I'm just sorry, I can't give it a voice in less than one. Giving this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better. <br /> <br /> Now I see that they are filming a sequel. Hearing that someone actually pays these people to make another movie convinces me that there is only too much money in Hollywood. Raise their treasures !!! Making a sequel to this movie may well constitute a crime against humanity; maybe an international tribunal should be convened or U.N. sanctions applied to the filmmakers. <br /> In short, it's a really bad movie. Really, really.
