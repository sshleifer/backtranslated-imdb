I think it was like Lizzie McGuire, except that it was much worse than the original. The only thing different is that she likes animals and science and all the geeky things. everything else is the same. she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask. and later she finds a guy who likes her and she has no idea. I think people should stop doing the same kind of shows. And another thing that is the same is that it is always the butt, friends are two girls and one guy. Do not believe people that these things get old and tired, and these ideas continue to be used again and again, and yet they continue to use these ideas. But I know people who see this show and I know they like them.
