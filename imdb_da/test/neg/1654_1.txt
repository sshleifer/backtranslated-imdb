Oh God! Beeb hit a new low with this gutless act of political correctness. A mixed race family living in Birmingham with a disabled child thrown into good measure. The one who ordered this tripe must be hunted and thrown to the dogs. The normally fun Jasper Carrott is as fun as piles in this show and doesn't get me started on the others. They have the timing and subtle of a nuclear bomb. I only hope that comedy gets better, but also by Little Britain and Catherine Tate if I doubt this very much. I think you'd be better off getting the box set to a decent yesteryear comedy like Fawlty Towers or Bottom if you want a laugh. BAN THIS SQUEAKY CLEAN RUBBISH!
