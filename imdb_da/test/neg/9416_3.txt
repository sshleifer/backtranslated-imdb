Mario Van Peebles tries to go on the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robot soldier who goes AWOL to preserve himself, but the government will not put this lying down, so among the simple plot Van Peebles protect villagers from rebel forces and defeat an improved version of itself in this disappointing movie. This obvious rip off of Universal Soldier (which is much more fun then this) simply doesn't go anywhere. The biggest problem is that the film is so incredibly inert. Van Peebles is just waiting around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a show. On the other hand, the film looks like a competent version of R.O.T.O.R, although where the eerie bad movie was fun, it only provides occasional laughter in its ridiculously convincing action sequences. Like R.O.T.O.R it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the film is awesomely boring. Plus the bad guys are disappointingly weak, and basically the film needs a real action scenario to work because the material is too boring. In all respects, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Bad)
