As a fan of writer Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I was looking forward to seeing this movie. However, I did not catch it in the cinema, and after watching it on TV, I am very pleased that I resisted buying it on video. Out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst films in Dutch film history. All the good parts have been left out, the story has changed, not the benefits. All humor has been cut out. What is left is a bad act, over dramatic, non-consistent film, which I will never see again. <br /> <br /> I condolve Giphart with this result and am happy that Robbert Jan Westdijk made a hell of a better job at Giphart's tops Phileine says sorry. Go see the one!
