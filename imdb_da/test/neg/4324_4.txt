Perhaps the weakest movie in the "Kharis" series, despite John Carradin's presence (mistakenly as an Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, hilariously hit by a bad case of Parkinson's disease), supporting Lon Chaney Jr. as titular creature - if it was actually him under the bandages, as his contribution at best is insignificant! It is a wise 60 minutes in itself, I think, but the standards are significantly lowered compared to the two previous entrances, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. Almost the only interesting feature here is that the female lead happens to be the Reincarnation of Princess Ananka, mentioned much in previous films, but never actually seen.
