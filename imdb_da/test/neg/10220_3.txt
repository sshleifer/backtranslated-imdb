Above GW is a near defect in a debut function and not because it is not without trying ... In fact, it is. It's a shame the more because it's writer / instructor / technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he portrays in the movie. Sometimes a first filmmaker, full of the power of getting thumbs up or two from other movie students, goes into a style that is too incoherent, uncertain and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, The extremely personal side gets dirty with the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 when he was put into a horrendous program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "patients" with the crazy group's scary tactics, psychological mind-*** sessions that could continue for days and attitudes from rehab Leaders who wanted to make the most Nazi circles finally fled when he was 15. I'm glad he came out, though it can help if he goes into a rehab for his film-making abilities in just a few days to learn things like say, structure, proper lighting, liquid movement in the camera, subtlety with actors and other basic things that are constantly lost here. It's more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a topic that needs to be publicized more recently (there was a newsweek article on a similar AA cult rehab). Many times one wonders whether certain personal character studies can work better as a documentary film as opposed to narrative drama. This is an offensive feeling all over GW, where it almost feels Gaglia will tell the truth, but does not know how to communicate it properly through his characters. The character you would think is closest to him, the Bronx teen Tony Serra (Gallagher), taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being where there is very little back story (we see a short freak-out in black and white in his old home) and little connection to his mother (Moriarty), who has more potential that is never tapped apart from a cold stone passing her children to another. But there is a story to go with its two-year crisis, I think. <br /> <br /> Just outside bats, things get tough (a naked cavity search in the first five minutes), and soon it is clear that instead of medical care, it is more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sects where the chief doctor Hiller (Insinnia) is a total overriding salary. But soon, Tony's sister Sofia (Donohue) is thrown into the program, and unlike Tony's repeated moments of violent assault and suspected non-compliance, she heads up through the groundbreaking three-step program and once released becomes a round. At times there are points in this broken nightmare where there is a woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been in the program for a year and a half, finds that she has become a prisoner who must not leave and reaches the father of the largest siblings come and pay an excited visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to those who have some raw power, very short glimpse of Gaglia at least getting some leverage in pure melodrama. But there are moments few and far between. It is not only the unsuccessful characters that are mostly reduced to stereotypes that appear as hysterical D.A.R.E. rip-offs (perhaps some of them, like an angry black youth, the passive aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister who has been steered out of siblings as having beaten and almost thrown into the program, would resound more if there was more time to develop any of them). It's that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his small $ 30,000 budget that not one side of the potential talent he has can get through. He spends tones, mostly with a shadow that looks urinary), he jiggles his handheld DVX camera as if it were intense Ala City of God. Occasionally, a character will just shoot into the frame at random, his choice of music is like the worst options possible from pseudo-indie soft rockers, and there are even false interview scenes with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) And Krakowsky who feel as fake as possible. <br /> <br /> Only Gaglia did not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to artistic cathartic plan B? Bottom line, no matter how much life stories from the heart can appeal to you, do not let it be seen in the theater or even with rental unless you love a last scene with two children staring into the digital hued Hudson river sunset with the last words reading: Dedicated to the children. Oy.
