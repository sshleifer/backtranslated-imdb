These are species that already hatch in a beautiful model (Mathilda May). A smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a strong launch and infected by a drill virus in the middle to the end. <br /> <br /> The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot / story. As you should have compared, Natasha Henstridge's Species has the same plot but adds very interesting side plot and does not mention good actions and strong clymatic ending. <br /> <br /> This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the company fleet in Star Trek Next Generation; He wanted to find more models in glass cages that flow inside Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> A must see for a science fiction fan.
