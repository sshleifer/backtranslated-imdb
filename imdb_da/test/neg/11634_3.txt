Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend due to meeting Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile, the Crete eggs are beginning to weed. As they cause problems in the city, Brown & Townspeople as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures have to fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the city. <br /> <br /> The original critics were a minor attempt to tear off the family horror flick "Gremlins". It became a cult favorite on the video shelves and was successful enough to justify a successor. This sequel plays down horror and makes his whole focus comedy instead. Unfortunately, the comedy part is extremely clumsy, as well as childish. The play is on par with the rest of the movie. It's just that the movie suffers from a weak script. The visual effects are quite well done. <br /> <br /> Degree: D + Review by M. K. Geist.
