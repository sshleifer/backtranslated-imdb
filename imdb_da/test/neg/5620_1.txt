Who wrote this flick? An uninspired 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> Could have been written by one of the kids who made Columbine shooting. <br /> <br /> Totally uneven, not fun everything, boooooooriiing ... <br /> Plus this: the French do not put their flag anywhere. You do not go into a French bank and see the tricolore flag shown as such. Even on the Bastille day. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the carnage. It's just that none of these are trustworthy or fun. Or parodic or something similar. <br /> <br /> Ok, those who liked this flick will tell you that I have to be a kind of fascist, so forget my comment.
