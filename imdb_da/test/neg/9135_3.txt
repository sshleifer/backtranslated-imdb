The first two films in this series excelled in their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the middle of society. This movie does not have any of the natural footage that I understand is part of the point, but it does make the whole movie component of the movie seem like random pictures stuck - those and zeros are flying around, computer models of people skeletons and so on . Occasionally, the stocktaking (nationalism / finance segment around 35:00) is recorded, but it usually makes the video seem to lack meaningful content and requires you to accept the context of the stock photography instead of the context of the director. It is no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. Three stars added to the Philip Glass soundtrack.
