This movie really sucks. Just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this baloney about a nice girl (Joan Woodbury) who gets involved in the 'underworld' because she needs money (and because she's too lazy to take a job from friends after they offer it to her). Alan Ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but he is nowhere to be found in the first freaking half hour, and when he turns out, he stands as a constipated mannequin. A real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable (as well as stupid) characters to make you want someone to shoot anyone, like really fast. Take a pillow.
