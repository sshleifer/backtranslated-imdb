I just caught this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the loudest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV rep in the movie was the annoying Jerri from a previous season of Survivor. The only entertaining thing was that the "secret base" was the house of Fantasy Island (and a million other movie and television shows; the place is in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. If the tattoo had been eaten by the snake, I could have given this movie a 2, but good. Seeing people standing there screaming for five minutes while Komodo or the cobra woke up over them instead of driving it was pretty funny, especially because you could really tell they just screamed at an empty place where the computer's animators would later paint in the monster. I almost fell out of my chair, but in a flashback scene, they took either cobra or komodo - so normal size - in an indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it. Wouldn't an arch have been sufficient? LAUGH OUT LOUD! Guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. I must remember that I rent Showtime for their series and not their movie.
