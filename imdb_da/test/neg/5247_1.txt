"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no sign, no story, no real dialogues, bad fighting ... It's probably the worst movie in the history of the cinema. It is deadly boring, a lost time. I'm really sorry Christophe Lambert, who clearly doesn't know how to choose a role. If anyone suggests you see "Beowulf", believe me: run like sour.
