The reason for a movie is a giveaway. How can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music in India - a story that this one writes itself. I want to see most of it, but it was not available. The sad thing is, the white people are the most colorful in the movie. Vanessa was a rebellion with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was such a good eye, but everyone else was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was unique in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was so boring. The saving grace was really the background music, which made it good to laugh at the movie, rather than the movie, or not at all. There are many other better gay films, ethnic films, just ordinary movies. I give a lot of low-cost movies a pass, but it should not have been made or should have been made by another.
