In 1976, a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One evening, a box is placed on the door of their home and the following morning the open box cuts to reveal a button that needs to be opened with a key. By late afternoon a man with terrible scarring comes to his door to the door and presents Norma with a quote. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they hit the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they do not press it, nothing happens and the offer will move on to another. Norma and Arthur must not tell anyone, including their son, about this deal. The family's incentive to push the button is raised by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, fails to be accepted for a new job he is applying for and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut. <br /> <br /> A pleasure for this bizarre sci-fi thriller based on the short story "Button Button" by Richard Matheson will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ridiculous premise. The film's opening is particularly problematic by shaping itself into a realism with the household. Richard Kelly's former movie Donnie Darko smoothly applied the condition of schizophrenia to justify his outing in paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of the much better movie, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is absolutely incredible. That Norma would also accept someone in her house who almost has the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believes in this offer seems equally confidential. <br /> <br /> If this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy of someone who was hit by lightning strikes, the possibility of alien life or another godly fear affecting those situations. Scenes involving gateways that open up into public libraries, random nosebleeds, and thoughtless drones that stalk the Lewis family are almost inadvertently comical in their absurdity. At some point, the film can be called exciting clean to see where it goes. Kelly is occasionally clever in her ability to keep our attention through many of the film's contrivances. On a stage, Norma teaches in a class and is then asked by a strange boy about her foot. He cheats on her as she lacks four of her toes. Later, on a rehearsal dinner for a wedding attended by Norma and Arthur, this same student appears to be serving and seems to be stalking them. But the final justification for all these inequalities is wrapped in a highly-constructed sci-fi revelation that many will find impossible and difficult to swallow. What is most disappointing about the movie is that when the button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the moral implications originally promised are reduced to much of the images duration. The ending, which will not be pampered here, reappears these moral issues again in the hope of echoing it of a Greek tragedy. While the similarities can be seen, there is at this point, as it is unlikely that so much of the film and the irregular performance there is little reason to fit. Cameron Diaz's southern accent may be unnecessary, but it's surprisingly Langella, who is the most disappointing in the movie, with a very unbridled written role as the mysterious scar that seems to hide a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It's really just a shadow of his heavy performance in Frost / Nixon. There is not much for many of the other actors in the film to do; Especially both Norma and Arthur could not be considered signs, but mouthpieces to Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and short conversations like Norma sympathizes with Arlington over their deformities, and also when Norma and Arthur ask if they really know each other if the button kills any of them, highlights this. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to make a movie that has lived up to Donnie Darko's quality and imagination. Although this movie may be exciting for a while, it is too absurd and impossible to be enjoyed, and it would certainly not warrant more views given the rather illogical revelations of the film. Science fiction fans may appreciate it a little more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly really tries to say under the surface remains cryptic. The box is a movie this year, which should have been a shelf.
