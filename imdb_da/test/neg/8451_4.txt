** SPOILERS ** With the title of the movie named the killer fish twice not once, you would expect to see them in action attacks biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters. Instead, wait until the movie is almost over, so that you get as much as a glimpse of the piranhas. Still, all you see is the water bubbling and stirring, as a poor person disappears under the condition that he is eaten whole and alive by the fish. <br /> <br /> The movie "Piranha Piranha" starts with this scary look Piranha on the screen as credits start rolling down, but **** SPOILER **** this is the only time in the movie you ever get for To see the killer fish or fish you never see a piranha is the movie again. What you see is a travel explanation of Venezuela, and it's the people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon basin. Along with a lot of beautiful and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as people and wildlife, but it's all about. There is some sort of story that has to do with this great white hunting caribe, William Smith, which ironically means Piranha in the native language spoken there, is this what the title of the movie "Piranha Piranha" really meant? "Caribe Caribe"! The person Caribe is played by the legendary Hollywood Hell's Angles biker and the whole of the hard guy William Smith. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the film, this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown & Ahna Capri, and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, are entering the Venezuelan jungles to watch Terry take pictures to send home. Terry is horrific when we learn that as a young girl, her father got her head blown by a gun. Even when art rescues his life using one when see se attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake Terry almost belts him to have a gun; as he promised her he would not go with him on the trip. <br /> <br /> At a jungle rest stop or bar, the three run into Caribe, which we first saw catching monkey in the jungle at the start of the movie. Caribe welcomes herself more than the three with her knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy of life and death, as well as his ability to get them where they go to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin. <Br /> Even though it is a bit odd at first, the guy is in for himself that he does not seem to notice that there are any people around him, shows Caribe to be a bulging and passionate guy who engages in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with Art. Caribe even shows Terry, who at one point in the movie almost knocked his teeth out, the fine points of hunting and shooting of the game, which he believes do not really die, but becomes part of him after he kills them! A little crazy, but you have to admit this guy has imagination. <br /> <br /> It is much later in the movie that for some strange reason perhaps the cheap booze he dreamed, Caribe suddenly goes crazy and becomes homicidal attacker and rapes Terry and then kills his furious brother and feeding him to the deadly piranha s. Trying to escape from the fierce lunatic and then being forced to fight with him. Art is being beaten so violently by the dirty fight Caribe that he almost leaves unconscious. Exactly when Caribe is finally killing Art, he is shot to death by Terry, who, after experiencing what this crazy piece of emergency is about, finally decides that weapons are much needed and should be used to kill in very rare but life-saving apartments. br /> <br /> Worth to see if it is worth looking at only for the landscape and nothing else. It's just a shame that the movie should advertise as a killer fish or Piranha, horror movie, if it was honest about itself, it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with Smith he built for it, Tarzan plays from the Venezuelan, not African, jungle
