This film turns facts about Anne and Mary's life into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who was actually a pretty stupid and foolish creature, and make her the "good" sister, is just stupid. It is Anne who was actually the much more interesting character, and so it is her life, and not Maria, who has been so often. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... for me, Henry was the real criminal. No matter what Anne's motives for winning the king and keeping her feelings for a crown and husband, must be taken in conjunction with the time when those real life events took place. Anne was a relatively innocent figure compared to most of the hips. Most modern historians discount or have disputed most myths and badges that this movie continues with her and I have never heard of anyone who actually thinks rumors than she slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and false that it is crazy to believe that anyone without knowing about this period in history could go away with believing everything that this film has presented as "facts". I didn't even get into the weird filming of the movie ... but I'm pretty sure cameras were not invented in the 16th century, so I don't understand why Anne and Mary talk to one in the whole movie ... It is a really bad plot design and is fighting and annoying to say the least. <br /> <br /> Neither is Anne of the Thousand Days accurate, but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of history's most exciting women. Don't even think about renting this. It's two hours you never come back!
