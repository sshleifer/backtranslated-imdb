The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the protagonists, Lewis (Urbaniak), has an author block and apparently also made the screenwriter the movie. This is also sad that I believe in the big thing, it must be a comedy or a drama, but it is the funniest thing I can remember from seeing this. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way home, two decide to have their fortunes told by a "gypsy" whom they call her. These two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. Then nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I didn't destroy the movie there, but really, this extremely low budget, poor quality movie had some idea when it started, but quickly snowballed in the depths of hell. Yeah, I'm tough. Honestly it wasn't that bad, it was just blah. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned writer was annoying to look at, although he might have delivered one or two of the only two fun lines. The clich√© "ladies man", the only one who didn't get his fortune told, was just annoying. The only bright place was the remaining friend, the poisonous father, whose fortune was told that something great was going to happen to his son, and he had to be prepared. He was fun, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too cruel. Heck, they got the ambition to make a movie, went and got funding and got something. Unfortunately, though, I can't recommend the movie on the basis of hundreds of other independent films that have hundreds of better ideas and executions. This was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretching another 81 boring minutes.
