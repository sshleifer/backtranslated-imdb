A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but when they start playing it, each one begins to die just as they do in the video game. As they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to beat the game's main villain, The Blood Countess, before she kills them all. The pastor sounds a little stupid and familiar, but this movie could still have been mildly entertaining. However, this "horror" movie is not scary at all. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The movie is all too serious and the movie is not much fun to watch. Sure there are occasional laughs, but mostly the movie is very boring. PG-13 horror movies can still be good as The Ring or Cry Wolf. Calling and staying alive is not the same kind of horror movie. Stay Alive is more of a slasher film, and since its nominal PG-13, the death scenes are very tame. It should have been the film's main sales, and since it had an interesting concept, the deaths could have been really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a larger audience and the film had to be changed. The play is a complete joke, and most of the players give horrible performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leader. He lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the public to worry about him. His character is not unlikely to be very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually gives a good performance, although it is a little too bland to really stick out. Frankie Muniz certainly offers the best performance at Stay Alive. It's an honor at the level of being the best player on the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is horrible as October. Her performance feels so rushed and so fake. The most annoying character in the movie is the Phineas game by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikely that you will kill to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are quite unlikely to become even more interested in the movie. It's just hard to be sorry for some of these annoying kids, and it's very fun to see if you want the characters to survive. The only really good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a bit old, but it's still a kind of work. The film is also very short, so it's not too much of a pain to sit through. I wouldn't really blame the cast because they worked with an inexperience and instructor. The direction is not very good, and the manuscript is not much better. In fact, Stay Alive is not the worst horror movie of 2006. That honor would go when a foreign call. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity though. Finally, this cheesy and lame horror movie is better back on the shelf. Rating 4/10.
