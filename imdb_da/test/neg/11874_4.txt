Since Wesley Snipes fell (or Ascending) to the DTV action movie world, the result has been miss, uneven and missed. Unstoppable was weak. 7 seconds was entertaining. The mark was the gentle scraping of the septic tank. /> And what about The Detonator? We want something over that suffers Marksman again. But the detonator has a small amount of profits that are hampered by a lazy star and low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a not-so-known book Covert that offers illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his latest mission ends with a bullet that leaves a bunch of bodies, Sonny is ordered to escort a witness; Nadia (the always hot Silvia Colloca) to the USA. Trouble is; Sonny is being beaten by a traitor in his own organization, keeping his track warm for gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions. <br /> <br /> Snipes delivers in the action department. He's in half-leaf fashion here. He actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator before it goes down in pure sleepwalking fashion that destroyed Marksman.Colloca does more than look nice. There is some conviction for her scenes. Many of the players know well-known and have been in last 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipes films. It's always good to see Michael Brandon again. The action is telegraphed here. But it is never boring. Running, car racing, Fights.Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have improved after Seagal farce; Out of Reach. He does a credible job. But is constantly hampered by the low budget. Not with the Eastern Euro sites. It is cheap to see the movie's look. br /> <br /> The detonator just ends the average. It's not that bad about its fun aspect of Seag Al's Mercenary for Justice. But it's not as close as entertaining as Van Damme's second in command. Not as exciting as Dolph's Mechanics. Maybe Dolph should lead Wesley next eh? <br /> <br /> Its Feast Manufacturers pump a little more money and thought about these DTV titles with the kind of money they make from them. It's just fair. The result may be a high seller perhaps? <br /> <br /> Snipes will be recommended to try to make it his last DTV action flick. It is sad to see another waste of this talented actor's talents.
