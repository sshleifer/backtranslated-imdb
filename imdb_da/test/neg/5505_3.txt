Generally, I am an admirer of Jess Franco's film production, but for some of these movies, I really find it hard to understand the motivation behind them or even their very existence. Like this sick puppy, for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no film value, it is poorly crafted without any plot and contains some of the most unfortunate sleaze footage ever captured on film. This is another filthy woman-in-prison movie where rape, lesbian action and violent torture games are daily routine. The guards are brighter than the prisoners, and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexual upbringing when he sees a girl having sex with a dog (!). The girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the film, but you can't really enjoy this view with all the perversion going on. The dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what he offers), a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner, and the image of a poor girl with a needle sprayed through her nipple. Auch! Avoid this sick mess and you will save yourself the trouble of taking two baths to wash away the felt.
