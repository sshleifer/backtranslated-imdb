This movie could have been much better than it was if it hadn't been a Disney movie. I thought the young girl playing Shirley was okay, you could tell she was really trying to do the job right. Teenage Shirley Temple was not right at all. I think they should have spent the last time in their childhood, the first hour should have been about young Shirley, so the last hour should have been about older Shirley. This was a boring movie and not a good Shirley Temple story.
