Some teenagers go to an old, abandoned farmhouse left for one of them by their dead grandfather, unaware that there were more murders there decades ago because their grandfather had made a covenant with the devil for a good harvest - doesn't the guy think of anything better to sell his soul to? Husband's grandchildren and his friends are set up to be the next victim, for reasons never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, the black guy with a white boyfriend and the two lesbians have to fight with three killed scarecrows - but don't let me fool as I was, it's almost as fun as it sounds. It's mostly just a lot of chit chats about the ball kicking, dope smoking, and the main actor complaining never to know his parents. The camera's work is horrible and shaken, perhaps done on a handheld camcorder in some scenes, which is perhaps a good thing, since the scarecrows seem to have just come from a child's birthday party, and apparently they could only hire two people to Play the three scarecrows! Some of the best movies I've seen have been these low budget, independent horror movies, but this one is just pathetic. The play and the crew seem to have been composed of a lot of people who knew each other, had never acted before and didn't intend to act again and had a few thousand dollars (I can't believe this movie cost $ 130,000 to husband) and a weekend of leisure on their hands - although the lesbian, shiny dipping scene is lame. I also find it entertaining that from this writing there is a sequel to this movie, which you have not even bothered to add to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * out of **** and I only consider it at most only because of the skinny dipping scene, no matter how small it may be.
