If I guess your "palabra", will you let me go through? - Ask William Geld, a Tim Robbins, who continues to act as telling him a great joke and he is not trying to laugh. <br /> <br /> He's trying to get to a forbidden area. The woman stops him continuing blabbering: -You "palabra" are Carrefour. <br /> <br /> How did you know? - asks the lady surprised. He answers, in the name of wisdom: -I heard when you did not speak. : / <br /> Yes, this defines the movie. This just. It doesn't matter if Carrefour is "road conjunction" in French, or if the future is cold bureaucratic and blends languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, no Spanish (Maria Gonzalez is her name in the movie) with her Irish, Scottish whatever tone. <br /> <br /> It's boring and boring. If you fall into faith, there are several symbols, you will buy the most bizarre, morbid love relationship ever set in a future that may be in seven seconds. I can guess this movie palabra: it will be "painful".
