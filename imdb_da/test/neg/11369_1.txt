If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be glad to hear that FX got into the guts of the TV to hell and threw it into the fingers of this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, there was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff on it. The movie was the now overused "docu-action" look, complete with cuts to grained B&W rawcore recordings. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it certainly sounds like something DP told the director before the movie. I don't know what they were up to here, but it reminded me of the guy in the office who thinks Powerpoint presentations with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool". The story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in southern California. It is true, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work where there are security measures up ying-yang. For real, they put 2 official CHiPpies in the mix. Because they could stop 6 people, right? Six. I think even Bruce Willis had to deal with more terrorists in the stupid Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (TV's Teri Bauer) plays a CHP officer who is having trouble talking on the phone after she is shot in her bulletproof vest. Her voice sounds like a Sally Struther's TV ad, whiny and monotonous. Her character is only a plot unit, and after she performs her little duty, she is immediately disposed of. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood stars as FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, constantly pointing to how he beats foreign diplomats on the face. His boss is out, no one over at the Dept. of Homeland Security believes its forecast of the situation. He is the sensible one of a group of paranoid public officials who are afraid of blaming any kind of disaster. He is calm, he is strong, he lives. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing releasing or entertaining about melting - OK, maybe Teri Bauer is dead, was rather unnecessary and fun - other than that, nothing redeeming.
