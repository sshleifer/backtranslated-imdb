I rented this movie the other day b / c I love romance stories, but it must be the worst I have ever seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after they hardly have said more than two words to each other when she has a fantastic long-time lover who is totally devoted to her. I thought Kelley was a big smoker in the whole movie and he was never changed. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did a wonderful play and I have to start watching more movies of his.
