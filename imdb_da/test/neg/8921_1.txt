This is only the second time I have been moved enough to write a review. Unfortunately, they have both been to films that can be described with more than four letters that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the second film of such a caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> Anywa, on the review .. There are several important things wrong with this movie, which I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) The steven has lost the plot (ie, in all his other films, the family / friend is killed. The steven gets angry. The steven kills the people. the end). 2) The steven is out of money was a good car hunting scene at first, but I think he was blowing his budget on it and couldn't afford a decent scriptwriter or editor. 3) The ladder no longer seems to make its own action. instead, (from memory) 2 battle scenes were shot down and from the back so you couldn't see his face. probably a stunt double. I guess chuck norris. <br /> <br /> In summary .. worst seagal movie ever. next worst movie I've seen in recent history and I've seen many bad movies.
