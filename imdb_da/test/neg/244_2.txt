After the pleasingly atmospheric original and the entertaining stupid one, this incredibly boring, slow and unintentional successor comes across as a great letdown. Once again, the secret criminal mastermind Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from Aztec's mummy Popoca. The bat builds a hilarious clunky lumbering robot with a human brain to achieve this horrible goal. Flat directed by Rafael Portillo, with a spoken and boring script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, was eerie continuity (for example, the baton was clearly killed at the end of the previous movie, but is miraculously alive and well here!), A creepy sluggish script, an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks, a chronic narrative, a crippling lack of action and momentum, pretty boring going through the movements (not) appearing from an understandably uninterested cast and a badly staged climate fight between the mummy and the robot (the movie finally breaks to sidesplitting stupid life with the big bash, but unfortunately it lasts almost two unpleasant minutes and thus turns out to be too little too late to alleviate the severity of the overall overwhelming boredom) this numbingly dry, drippy and draggy stringed prices as a complete washout.
