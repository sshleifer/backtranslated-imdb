I don't usually see Hollywood dribbles, but I was dragged along with some friends to watch this one, which turned out to be entertaining in places, but without any originality. Don't worry, you don't have to think. Tarantino-like story probably gives general tips for us to properly predict where it goes about fifteen minutes before each "twist" - I was worried that the movie was building pretty nicely to a Hollywood flick, but that it would have nowhere to go on climax. And boy was my fear realized - YMCA couldn't save this, but Liv Tyler did almost. I suppose to be male and helped in my twenties, but she did a really good performance - of course she didn't have to do much, except to look amazingly over-the-top sexy, but what she did did well! McCOOL's certainly doesn't go down as one of Hollywood's great successes (or should I say "shouldn't" because the ordinary American film industry doesn't go anywhere at the moment and hasn't hit a decade at least as American beauty, titanic and saves privacy, and even they had big flaws), but if you are a teenage man, do yourself a favor and see life - she is a hot chick. Rating: 5/10. See also: something by Quentin Tarantino, any American teenager movie over the last decade, something with sex as the main selling point.
