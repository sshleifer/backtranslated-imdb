When I think of television movies, I always think of this movie, I've seen it a few times at Sky Movies, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It has been a long time since I watched this movie, just surfing and came across this: -S. A microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on holiday with her son (William Flemming), at this resort, a place they meet up with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / owner a bar?) And Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's like a strange romantic thing, William begins to fall to Kathy, and Paul falls for Linda. <br /> <br /> Some guy goes out on a street, he has some mark on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a deep-sea diver, as in some dives, saw a light or something and converted to religion), says he will take care of this person who is a hole in my memory, then there is a broad outbreak of the virus, I think Linda offers her help, to come up with a cure, Kathy gets infected (William notices a mark on Kathy's arm, with the virus, also does Joseph. <br /> <br /> Paul says some lines to Joseph, so Joseph stumbles away. The next time you see Joseph, he is cured of how this information is used to cure the infected, then there is a beach party, the end.
