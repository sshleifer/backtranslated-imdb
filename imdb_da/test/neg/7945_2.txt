Los Angeles, 1976. Indie film abruptly John Carpenter, fresh out of film school and with a movie - his class project is non-budget poof of 2001 called Dark Star - under his belt ends a gritty actioner called Assault On Precinct 13. The story of an almost abandoned police station during the siege of an invisible LA gang, it was a minor hit on the runway and received a little praise from the few critics who cared, but it hardly set the film world on fire as opposed to Carpenter's follow-up smash Halloween (1978 ). At Precinct, Carpenter was still learning to exploit its almost non-existent budget by using lower shelf actors, keeping the action on one sacred little placement and moving the movie together at a tight pace with a combination of editing, intelligent camera work and connected genre savvy . No one wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood anymore, especially if the week's catering bill on the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 is more than the entire price of the original. That means there is some kind of laziness on the side of a filmmaker - you have a stupidly large union, a study and a marketing company that everyone thinks of you. That's why twenty years after seeing Carpenter's movie, I still see every glorious moment from the little girl who was shot in cold blood while buying an ice cream for the relentless pounding synth score. One week after Assault 2005 I remember Larry Fishburn's unmoving ping pong ball eyes and a little bit more. "Forgettable popcorn actioner" fits perfectly to the top of the poster. It's New Year's Eve at Precinct 13, a station that shuts down with a skeleton staff to see in its last hours. On call, Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-dancer, is now deeply concerned and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene; Iris (The Sopranos' Drea de Matteo), a nympho with a thing for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a crusty old hour a scotch away from retirement. As in Carpenter's Assault ... a bus with four powerful criminals is transformed into Precinct. All wild eyes are on gangster kingpin bishop (Fishburne, who is still fond of his time in the Matrix), who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt by an underground policeman and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (a tired look Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are out, the power cords are down, and both crimes and police were heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging a task force of Duvall's corrupt police sporting white balaclavas, ball bearings, infrared bazookas and more high tech gear than Skywalker Ranch. This is believed to be when helicopter buzz around police's top shoots rockets into windows, is a secret operation to cover Duvall's tracks. He might as well have taken billboards on Hollywood Boulevard. <br /> <br /> As with the recent seventies genre recasting Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes the best plot of John Carpenter's original and, to quote the seventies, "do it yourself, man". The main question is - why bother? John Carpenter's 1976 is a cult favorite among genre buffs, but is hardly felt in the public's collective consciousness. Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks' classic Western Rio Bravo in a tight, claustrophobic urban thriller for just $ 20,000. The French wunderkind director and rap producer Jean-Francois Richet, a self-confident fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less worried about paying tribute to either the Hawks or the JC - though the manuscript is linked to references to cowboys and injons - and seems to be appropriate squeeze In as much flash and firepower as the multi-million dollar budget can withstand. The result: some tense moments with hand-held POV cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, a couple of neat plots, but essentially a B-class editor with a very inflated price. As for the name control Carpenter, it is the pure impression of the filmmakers who do not pay. <br /> <br /> I say bon voyage to Monsieur Richet and I wish you luck on your music career.
