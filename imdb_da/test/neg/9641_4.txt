My mistake for thinking about this was a serious war-hell movie before seeing it. It all ended seconds into the movie when the "MTV" logo was displayed. It might as well be called "National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose." And it played to the "MTV" audience; The movie that followed these comic first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least disney was smart enough to send his rated items to touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm tough; It wasn't that bad with a movie. But it certainly has its share of assaults and the movie is extremely biased / unilateral. I'm not a war movie buff. I can't see 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Save Private Ryan' more than once. Sure they were good movies, but they are not my forte, and they all seem to interfere after a while until I could not distinguish from the next. After a trip in Iraq, Phillippe plans the post-war life, but is withdrawn due to a clause in his contract. Or at least it is the military's plan until he goes AWOL, and the characters go quickly across the countries on a few bucks that were never caught. No, I have not been in any war, even in Iraq, nor do I agree. Nor do I have all the knowledge about recruiting or signing their contracts. I can say this: Although I'm sorry that they have been withdrawn in this conflict, I can't feel too much for anyone so stupid not to read the book. It's as if someone on their deathbed leaned to finally read the surgeon's general's warning on their cigarette box and say, "Oh, they're what? Deadly? I have to sue them!"
