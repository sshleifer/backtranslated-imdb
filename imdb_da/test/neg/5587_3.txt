I'm sorry ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's decent music wise, but the presentation is simply boring - big-time. Most songs sound the same, and leading singer-writer Jeff Lynne is just as animated as a merchant's mode. He has a pleasant voice, but he is not much to see. He just stands in one place and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all sound like the 1970s-1980s bubblegum things: comfortable but not exciting. Lynn is accompanied by a very beautiful woman, Rosie Vela, but she is not too animated either. The only song - out of 23 - that creates excitement is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven." Now, if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement for them, it could have been a much better concert DVD.
