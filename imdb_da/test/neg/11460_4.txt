Unfortunately, this movie is typical of watering a good movie of numerous successors. Universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a linking Frankenstein in mummy wraps that do not show signs of intelligent life. This movie is entertaining in spots, but if you have seen The Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
