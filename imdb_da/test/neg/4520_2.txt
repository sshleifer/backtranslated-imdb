Wow, even American idol and so you think you can dance has more adult stuff now than WWE (at least the auditions have a number of people abusing the judges) and here is WWE, plodding with one of the worst traits in television history , by changing to PG. Now that I change some times to see what's going on, that's what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, the ugly midget, shares his place with the main events for apparently no reason except to span young fans and of course beats Chavo Guerrero, a skilled break in every match <br /> 2) A guest host (arghh ....!) every week to spoil the teaspoon of fun that was otherwise present. All these hosts are cheap B-grade celebs who are trying to catapult again by breaking horrible, 5-year-old jokes and stupid references. 3) Cryme Time and a female wrestler (forgot her name, probably eve) give instruction on various "street" words (sob) that are neither street nor cool. They were funny before, stealing things and being loud. <br /> <br /> 4) Divas are dressed in unmatched clothes that tie their best to look "sexy, smart and powerful (by the way, I hate this catchphrase) Remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there? These were And these divas are bad wrestlers, which increases misery. I've seen some old games of the WWE in the Vintage collection and the divas over there were "professional" not amateur. 5) PG movement limits so many things: almost no blood in battles, DX is terribly annoying, John Cena does even more of his patriotism action, the crowd contains many children (who are so annoying), almost no "heels" etc. 6) And yes, why keep PPVs so often. have they lost it? There is no real sweep or rivalry ever created, and those who have finished watching fake and just-to-de-PPV get over them. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and a few quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest running TV show in history" (how r week "<br /> <br />" BRUTAL and VICIOUS attacked (he doesn't use it for anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy "<br /> <br />" An evil attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-Hs man !!! ??? "<br /> <br /> WWE is now almost at his death Hope Vince stands up from his sleep and does something (bring back TV-14 or attitude era) 2 out of 10 for the current state of WWE .
