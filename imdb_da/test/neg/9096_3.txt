Gordon goes over the top in typical Full Moon fashion, but one can expect that. Combs are surprisingly low key and keep their performance more realistic than we are used to seeing. Also away is the usual Stuart Gordon's heavy-in-kind black humor. The movie is quite effective at showing Combs' breakdown and his last heroic action to save his wife and daughter. You actually feel sympathy for his character, despite his short feelings. Personally, I was more surprised at the nudity and boundary of porn sex scene than I was shocked at the graphic violence and doing. /> <br /> Not classic Gordon, but definitely something you can enjoy if you've seen his more famous movie.
