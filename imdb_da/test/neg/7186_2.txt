Afraid of Darkness left me with the impression that several different screenshots were written, too short for a film of their own length, so they splintered into this Frankenstein monster. In his best, the protagonist, Lucas, was scary. As hard as it is to draw a gem on secondary characters, they are much more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Afraid of Darkness could have achieved mediocrity if it had taken a single approach and seen it through - and had made Lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off-putting. I wanted to see him wrapped up in an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life.
