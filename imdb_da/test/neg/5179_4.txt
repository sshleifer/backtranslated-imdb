'Rise of the Footsoldier' ​​follows the incredibly ugly journey of gangster Carlton Leach and his fellow men through drugs, violence, sex, violence, weapons, violence and I referred to violence? <br /> <br /> Protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of the ICF (Inner City Firm); A group of football hooligans became professional gangsters, guides the audience through the events that led to the 1995 'Range Rover Killings', where three gang members were victims of particularly evil professional hits. Leach's success as a doorman and talent for locating wise violent friends to control troubled punters at a local night club launches him into the company of infamous drug dealers and gangsters taking advantage of the 80s / 90s rave scene and drug culture. <br /> Opening with the brutally realistic shots of the dead men, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but went completely unhappy. The next 2 hours meander through a number of innumerable characters introductions. Each of them basically establishes another typical "hard man" who shows that he usually attacks unworthy victims before he is likely to come to an even nostalgic end. Which little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters (for example, a family man blamed for missing substances) is quickly destroyed when either anti-climactically killed or their history is undissolved. Hints about a plot introduced at the beginning are insufficiently completed with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as the events have come in with some rewards to endure the lazy muddle of past events. <br /> <br /> This movie is made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience who prefers violence and 'ard nut' snake for a real story. The 'Footsoldier's Rise' borrows too much from 'Football Factory', where the good bits are discharged, and there are no moral ramifications of the hooligan subculture or the creation of empathy with the protagonist. The violence, though brilliant shot, seems excessive and incredible, because no one is far enough for the audience to form an emotional connection. The consequence of the ties being untouchable by the police is fair enough, but machete directors, who regularly commit blatant murder in public places, even push the imagination of the most willing seer. The audience is confused about the relevance of many important events and developed characters that had no effect on the final conclusion. Attempted 'gravel realism' is further destroyed by a substance called 'Truth Serum', which the Turkish mafia uses to gather honest answers from unwilling people. This is NOT the genre where one invents psychologically unrealistic substances and makes the question almost absurd. The actual scenes of violence (before they are repeated) hold tensions, spliced ​​with fast flashes of color or the end of a film reel. Seamless choreographed brawls combined with mandatory but effectively shaked handheld camera work save the movie, but unfortunately the plot (or lack thereof) limits it to a niche demographic. Essentially, the events this movie is based on, are not deservedly represented, and a sufficiently sequential story is killed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot. This movie has a place in the market, but if you like a little brain with your brutality, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
