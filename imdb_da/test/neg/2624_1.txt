Lazy movie made by a lazy instructor. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragic of this war, there is no emotion in the film at all. Symbolism is artificial and ineffective (and the old Bosnian woman who gives a picture of her son to Arbor, will "concretize" her will, awaken the superpower who sleeps in her, a corpse eaten by worms to show genocide horror ... also much is sometimes worst than not enough). This movie is just an ad, an empty elegance for a woman who is not a hero. She worked for the UN. Remember the UN failed to protect civilians at Srebrenica. Who are the true heroes of this war? A Canadian judge leading post-mortem trial for atrocities happened mainly because her organization failed to prevent them? Where's the criticism in this movie?
