Guy Pearce looks almost like Flynn, and this equality is the only one that this movie can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the Klaus Reicher character designation, the gay meeting is speculative fiction, and the film's allegations that Flynn treated native labor are poor are groundless. Director Frank Howson has not made any memorable films, and I find it fun for him to pursue Flynn without any foundation for further developing his tireless career. <br /> <br />
