I have officially vomited in my own mouth thanks to this movie. I was expecting the absolute worst with this movie, but I was expecting a cordial and pleasurable worst. This is just awful. Absolutely terrible. Terrible as Nazis spread the black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks speaks English. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> The villain looks as if she was traveling from the future set of Power Rangers. I really want her to get up from the ground and say "Finally! After ten thousand years I am free! It's time to conquer the earth!" Putties ... I mean the big bad, whatever they are ... they laugh a lot. Many of them look like a straight lamer version of the Cryptkeeper. The cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not. <br /> <br /> The only benefit to this movie was Paul Gleason. This movie could have been better if he had gone to the evil guys and said, "If I come in here again, I'll crack" skulls. "It would have been even better if one of Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson who mouthed his words as he said this. <br /> <br /> Also, the quick little creature is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> No word for the movie, though. I'll give this movie a two. I want so much. There's a passage I've remembered: The path of this movie is obsessed with every aspect of the inequality of the horror and tyranny of the spin-off horror .. Bliss is nothing, for this movie is blowing.
