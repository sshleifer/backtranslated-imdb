This movie is a bizarre fantasy tale that I'm sure doesn't appeal to anyone over 10 but is too strange for kids. The reason is stupid, and the play is one of the worst things I have ever seen. 25-year-old Kathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who seems like a 9 year old. She seems to have got her character voice by listening to Alvin and Chipmunks. Her tall-haired baby voice gets annoying the other, she starts talking. All the other plays are bad, but really Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The plot is also awful and is a kind of mix between Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter saying that her father, who left her long ago, fell into a bottomless grave in Africa, and when she goes to find him, she falls into an underground world full of strange Australian accented people. It's one of the corniest movies you'll ever see, with horrible lines all the way through. <br /> <br /> It annoys the effects this movie uses for character development. Kathy Ireland is a geek who won't do anything or go anywhere. She flies to Africa .... wow, what development! She drops her glasses and doesn't need them. Why does it mean that it does not become a geek, to drop one's glasses? It should represent her descent into blindness. It's just stupid. The only positive thing I can think of is that there are semi-special effects and camera work, and musical scores sound OK. All in all, it's a ridiculous family fantasy that only appeals to those who don't expect anything from a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 84 min. PG for violence.
