This movie was of the 67 of 71 best pictures I've seen, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent man for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who was absent for so long by randomly working on an oil rig next to the Congress party? This movie also featured some of the worst stereotypes of African-Americans I've ever seen. That makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look progressive! I hardly saw a movie that I didn't like so much. UGH!
