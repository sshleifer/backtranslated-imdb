... And boy is it soft <br /> <br /> I saw this on the cable channel Bravo on a Saturday night, and here in the UK we often have these gloomy "erotic" soft core films that turn up late at night on Bravo. This follows a WEIRD SCIENCE type prototype of a few college geeks, building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen one of these movies, you've seen them all with a bunch of bimbos that look like they advertise silicone implants. Come on, I've actually seen breasts in real life (I'm sure another one of us also has) and they snuggle around as opposed to where they talk about the laws, whether physics or at least gravity. Gender scenes are these boring things, where a fragrant geezer rubs against his fellow star without dialogue or sound except for some muzak, and when they climax it seems they both have a bad attack of constipation. The girls themselves are very beautiful especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted in these kind of soft core films <br /> <br /> And if that is imagination, then again, when I recommend the Trilogy's Lord of the Rings
