I find it disturbing that in an era when gratification and fulfillment of spirituality is unknown, and we are all scattered across the full range of possible beliefs that a charlatan and fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is unusual it is no denial he had a special gift, it is a pity that he abuses it, but to increase his wounded ego, feel the adulation of unwanted sheep that were at his pitch and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credibility. This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's own largely fictional and amazing account of his formation and "awakening" (which I would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could swing his mind and will to certain types of unfortunately disoriented people). See if you dare to have an unpleasant eye opening about how badly deprived we are of true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and beware of getting your blood pressure medicine present if you are one of Those still hoping for a healthy religion emerging from the ruins of Christianity as a supreme example of filmography on the whole service of the premises and notions of a dysfunctional cult.
