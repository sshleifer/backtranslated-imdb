This movie tries its best to capture the classic Canadian movie experience: <br /> <br /> "quirky" and unpleasant characters (a few); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk music; a "quirky" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of Canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of "getting out of this city"; straightforward booooring. <br /> <br /> And it succeeds in every way. <br /> <br /> Something to note though. I couldn't figure out if this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure "quirky" comedy or something surreal as a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. Editing this movie jumped invisibly from one independent thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. Take for example the very open shots that shout teenagers in a car. Who are they and what are they doing? And this sub-uh plot (use this word plot solved) concering kids that seem to span generations. I don't think they actually do that, but the editing makes it look like they come from flashback, suddenly to the current time. Huh? What did I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Unless you laugh. Or you want to try and go for the inappropriate editing.
