The only riddle in this movie was how it was ever made. the British film industry needs to make movies, people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers' money (a'la BBC) to keep Luvvies in their lifestyles they've been accustomed to, without doing anything for it . <br /> <The movie was every thing wrong with British Films it was dependent on stereotypes, it was supposed to be about a London where people were either Posh and corrupt, Gangster, Luvvies or Gawd Blimey Jellied Eel types, The story script was just pathetic weak, to the extent that the policeman pulled out the phone and the ringtone was the "sweeney" theme, I just expected it. The whole movie was a happy shopper sweeney / lesser rip off. The priceless manuscript I noted was left behind and lost by a couple of times and is something even with my limited street wiseness would not carry around in my chest pocket anywhere, to the beach and the games, etc. Saying that Vinnie Jones is sympathetic, as is about the only thing in the movie, bad blocks. When Derek Jacobi entered the water at the end because he was Dickens, oh my god, what a lot of villain, and I'm positive here
