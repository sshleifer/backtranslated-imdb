I went to see this because I had never seen Tel-Aviv where the story is set. I was disappointed as it does not give many views on Israel's largest city. It is also pretentious ?? One of the movies that leaves you guessing its significance until you finally give up on the shoulder neck. The main character is Batya, a woman in the nineties who works as a waitress for catered weddings. Her parents apparently don't care much about her, and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels she has to take care of her. The little girl doesn't speak, and Batya can't give her social benefits because it's the weekend and the agency is closed. So she takes her back to her apartment with the delicious roof, and when it comes time to work in the evening, she must take the little girl with her. The manager is very dissatisfied with this and other shortcomings in Batya's work. <br /> <br /> Another protagonist is Keren who gets married. At her wedding party (where Batya works of course), she breaks her leg climbing out of a lady's cabin whose door doesn't open, and then she and her new husband can't take the Caribbean vacation they've planned. They end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view. It smells bad, there is traffic noise and Keren constantly complains. Her husband meets a strange attractive older woman ?? an author ?? who is also staying at the hotel and Keren cares that he has slept with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third protagonist is a Filipino woman named Joy who looks after old people. The old woman she is employed to take care of is very crabby and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English but not Hebrew or German. Joy is mostly concerned about how her son returns in the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat that he has asked. She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. The daughter of the old woman who hired joy is an actress who arises in a kind of post-modern "physical theater" adaptation of Hamlet, and does not go with her mother. <br /> <br /> The way in which these three stories, which cut instantly, are solved by themselves, is presumably supposed to mean something deep. I didn't get it. There is a fantasy element for Batya's relationship with the little girl, and perhaps Baty's non-existent relationship with the parents is somehow reversed in this relationship. When the joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, there is a strange effect where the small sails waves as blown by the wind, and they do it as if they are on the scale of a ship in reality. The fellow draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on an embroidery deck in the hotel room, and a tale of the strange woman's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized that I wouldn't lose sleep in the process. If someone out there has a clear idea of ​​what it's about, they might fill me in.
