OK, last night I saw world premiere by Paul Schrader's Exorcist: The Beginning of the British International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all that was hit by the movie, it was highly anticipated. <br /> <br /> The director was there and then most stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie sucked a lot of time. It was a real disappointment to me because I am a big fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's original 1973 films. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with that? Most of it actually. FX (you think the Matrix and LOTR's digital revolution never happened): editing (no real pace or rhythm), the actor (only Skarsgard could at times convince). The script was one, the IMO, created to explain the African scenes in the original film. So the movie had the feeling of a set scene, it gave nothing. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was Vittorio Storaro's filmography, even though I've seen better of him (Apocalyps Now). <Br /> <br /> The whole time I thought this was just a rough cut, an ongoing job. And that is probably what it is, given the (well-known) circumstances. But it does not change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to meet Schrader (very short), but I didn't have the courage to tell him what I was thinking about the movie and I was so nervous (that's the guy who wrote taxi driver for Christ's sake !!) that I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his taxi driver script ...
