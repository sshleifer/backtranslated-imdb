Tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, faces four staircases who, by most unorthodox means, remove animals to bring them to zoos. Tarzan has a boring but sexy enough wife with an impeccable hairdresser and a child. No one should mistake Tarzan to be taken care of by the hunters' evil actions. <br /> <br /> This Gordon Scott Tarzan flick is one of the silliest, completely and unnecessarily stupid; For some reason, the team did not find anything charming to maintain the movie, and then it is just a stupid nonsense. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil staircases, because Tarzan's environmental awareness led him to open conflict with the malefactors. The child and chimpanzee, both of whom belong to Tarzan, are kidnapped by the vicious stairways; so Tarzan summons the jungle's released animal forces to release the child and chimpanzee with Tarzan, who is leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE STAIRS are stupid, unappealing, quite uninteresting. Maybe as a child I could like it? Now one has to be too mediocre as malicious as the pathetic stairs punished by Tarzan asking a Tarzan flick not to be silly; I admit this. But are you also really entitled to ask these Tarzan flicks, but stupid, to have and show something wild? A bit gusto ?? even a little bit gusto. Some kicks, a little excitement, fun. Now Gordon Scott Tarzan is stupid, just in the sense that he has no game at all because he lacks all the excitement. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle animal eating a snake. What animals? Watch the movie, kiddos, now I've just given you an excuse to do so.) For some reason, the villain looks pathetic and causes mercy rather than good anger. The books give the impression that Tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way; And if you find a decent bodybuilder or other sportsman to look clever enough for the role, it may prove to be too demanding, almost impossible, Gordon Scott was too far from meeting the ideal. Wife Chid Tarzan for ignoring books. <br /> <br /> The script suggests Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate and unlucky to learn; but the book says otherwise, and we know that Tarzan studied very much alone with the help of his gift families' books before he even met white people. <br /> <br /> And I didn't like that scream. <br /> <br /> (It's supposed, dear kiddos, to be a real wild dick, not a missed yodeler.)
