Do you know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can't look away? This movie is not that good. The only reason you're still there is because you brought your children and you can't leave them alone in the theater. Maybe you can take a nap. Tim Hill should never work in movies again after delivering this horrible piece of junk. He manages to take a decent cartoonist in Jason Lee and make him a robot, insecure actor in this production. I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place I admit. If it wasn't basically the only family movie I could take my son around for Christmas, my wife wouldn't have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes to tell her what a stink I thought it was, but she hit me to the battlefield. <br /> <br /> I don't laugh. It's boring. Only David Cross's fantastic-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star. The story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as one might expect for a movie in this genre (though the latest "Curious George" was happily intelligent and fun). The play is mostly poor. The decision to "update" the Chipmunks songs to today's audience was, at best, not advisable and bony at worst. It does not work. <br /> <br /> Old chipmunks were clever, scary and sweet. These chipmunks are stupid, something medieval, unpleasant and in a surprise need to be useless. <br /> <br /> As a retrospect, a tribute or as a brand new production, this movie is completely unsuccessful. The final straw? My son couldn't wait to leave. Spend your money renting Curious George instead.
