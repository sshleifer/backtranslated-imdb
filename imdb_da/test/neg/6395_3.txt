This movie should be called Rinse it on the script. Directed by Stanley Donen, by Singin 'in Rain fame, this celluloid midlife crisis is not all bad. It has some lush scenes in Rio de Janeiro and various sharply-dressed extras cavorting with each other and scratching around the beach to the sultry sounds of samba, but there's just something about looking fifty something, Michael Caine gets it on with whiny teen Michelle Johnson it makes you feel ... well, sleazy. This story is also a complete stretch. Nobody, but perverse and in vain old studio experts in Hollywood could have gotten this embarrassment. Maybe they're so used to having young bimbos as arm candy that they forget it's their cool wallets that hold the key to their appeal, not their big Larry King style glasses and yellow cigar colored teeth. It's a thing for a nubile young sex pot to fall in love with an elderly man, but to her best friend's father who happens to be married? And then throwing himself at him shamelessly? Ugh! There is nothing entertaining about it. It's pretty pathetic and grotesque. Pay attention to a young Demi Moore's budding * cough * talent.
