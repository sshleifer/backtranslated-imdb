There is only one reason why this movie can be seen. To Schweiger. He is such a good actor, the film is not horrible. Uwe Boll please take another career. The special effects and actions are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (one evening with ...) talked about Tim Burton ever not reading Batman cartoons and it showed. Uwe Boll must never have played video games that he likes to make movies about. If you two ever want to know how it's done, go and see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games ever recorded. Some people may disagree, but if you see the movie, you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with Doom. It doesn't seem that anyone at UBIsoft was close to this production.
