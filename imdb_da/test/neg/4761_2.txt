This movie is simply bad. I have to say I am an expert on garbage games. I reserve a "1" rating for movies that are bad but fun, but this movie is just boring and certainly not crazy in a fun way but crappy in a crazy way. It becomes a "2" so those of you out there can distinguish between those who make you laugh and those who will make you fall asleep. There are scenes in this movie where the actors look at something, their expression is astounding, and wide eyes and laughter tell the audience that what they are looking at will be deeply stunning, it is simply not a closet or even more desert . It must be pretty god awful for me to go out, let me tell you, I went out and it also did a few people.
