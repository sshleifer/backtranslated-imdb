Elfriede Jelinek, who is not yet a household name, is a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her novel created a film that won the second prize in Cannes and top prizes for male and female leaders. Am I a dinosaur in cases of aesthetic recognition or have art been so discouraged that something goes? <br /> <br /> 'Gobble, gobble' is the favored orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbly sound produced by a turkey. In the film world, a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by receipts from receipts or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. The scandalous horror of this widely recognized film cannot be overstated. It starts out very badly as if it was made to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt inconsistent scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed writer, a rocky professor of piano. She lives with her husky and dominant mother. Father is an institutionalized lunatic who dies invisibly under what passes for the action. <br /> <br /> The review of the piano teacher is difficult, in addition to recording his discomfort. What we see in the movie (and perhaps read in the book for everything I know) is a foggy, exploitative, inappropriate story of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is minimally used, is originally shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not quite because there are handbags in the two-step scene with her gruesome maman early on ending up with great excuses. If a reviewer is to (dig) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when one would simplify), Elrika's violently changing mood would be. A young hunk, Walter, studied to become a low-voltage engineer, no matter what, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure activities, is also a talented pianist. He meets Elrika on an old-fashioned view in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and begins to 'cherchez la femme'. Pre-eminently Erika has a taste for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds, while sniffing a tissue taken from the garbage bin in the private booth where she looks. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition and is courageously accepted as a private student by Erika, whose style of teaching is characterized by remote, hostility, discouragement, and humiliation. He soon declares his love and long pursues Erika into the ladies, where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika keeps control of her loving scams. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasant exchanges. Meanwhile chilling jealousy due to Walter's kindness to a nervous student who literally has shits before an exercise for a future concert, Erika fills the student's fur pocket with broken glass and causes serious lacerations to the delicate piano hands. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (by passing sexual self-degradation, etc.), Walter has turned up on the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied up, relaxed, etc. Reasonable Walter is currently being rejected and marching out into the night. At this point, there is still almost an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika runs down Walter to the ice rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands that move on the pants. His 'baby sauce' will soon be expelled with a different stomach content. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Represented but hooked, perhaps the desire of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what's happening now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes brutal while Erika becomes a victim. For a moment he puts his mother in her room and beats Erika, the next she kicks her face, has sex with her and renews her love declarations. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I don't advise you. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they have the right mood. I could show myself at the challenging portrayal of human relations performed by this film if I wanted to. But I do not prefer, because it is a cheap and scary movie that appeals to instincts and says nothing. I must say that the parents suppress Erika's longing for love, seeking it ineffectively in pornography, rejecting it incorrectly, when it literally appears pink and throbbing under the nose, realizes too late that she doesn't like being hurt, blah bla, bla. <br /> <br /> For reasons the world has not explained, disturbed her. She apparently makes a monster out of someone who seemed to be superficially loving - but surely we all know that someone is potentially a violent rape because it is his essential nature, but how much he is trying to tell himself and the world otherwise . <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a little twist. Before going to the final scene, where she will perform as a replacement for the underwear-spreading student with the lacerated hands, Erika wraps a knife in her handbag. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you're in front of me. She sticks in a no-threatening area and goes. Role of credits. <br /> <br /> If this earned another prize in Cannes, how much was the rest of the records?
