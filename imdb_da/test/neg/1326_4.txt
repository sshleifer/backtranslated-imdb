Do people have to judge this movie a lot because it is a foreign war film ??? <br /> <br /> For me, it's no more than a bad Hollywood war movie in German. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on so many levels. To mention it with the Platoon or the Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The fighting sequences are pathetic, the dialogue and acting shudder. <br /> <br /> This so-called group of "storm troopers" is fixed in Wermacht. Not SS troops. There is so much wrong with this movie it is sad. Bad editing, bad acting. It has it all. <br /> <br /> The movie continues and continues as if the audience has to be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that this movie had a $ 20 million budget. <br /> <br /> For real? Where was it used? In the false train sequences? In the pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. <br /> <br /> Like another World War II history buffer and World War II movie fan, I found this movie a serious disappointment. For an excellent alternative war movie, see "The Beast". (Not another world war movie, but still outstanding) <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this.
