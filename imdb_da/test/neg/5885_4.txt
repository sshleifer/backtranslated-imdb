This is an extremely competent film technically. The camera's work and direction is excellent and the play is also fine - especially the fine that appears by Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis. I really thought there were no problems with these aspects of the movie at all. Instead, I was a little annoyed by the way the awnings were portrayed, as it didn't seem to be all honest and seems to be a very revisionist view of history. In fact, in recent years, the awnings have undergone some transformation into the defenders of freedom with great insight, not the cool sado-masochistic rape he really was. In a sense, it reminds the highest of laundering given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men are elevated to heroic status. Although you do not believe that the marquis's perversions were not so bad (they included rape and extreme violence), his depiction in this movie as a "sexual social worker" in this prison looks pretty stupid. Instead of the violent and selfish Sade, he spends a lot of time carefully caring for a young virgin and slowly helps her explore her own sensuality. What a lovely and kind man. In fact, now that I think about it, this idea reminds me of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without the song) - a sweet older man who loves the ladies. I strongly doubt the real life Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character at all! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the film does not have much nudity, although it is extremely explicit. Only a madman would let their children see this, as this is a very adult drama. It is very well made and quite entertaining - just not all that truthful. The director admits that the film is largely fictitious in the interview among the special features of the DVD I saw. So go ahead and watch the movie, if you want - understand it's just not that good historically. During the 18th century, sexual freedoms were completely accepted in France when they were rather broad-minded, so despite what the film suggests, it was not SEX that was the issue, it was violence and rape that was (and still is ) the problem.
