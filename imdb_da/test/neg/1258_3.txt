For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster ?? ten minutes of charm and ninety securities. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often rising over Nora Ephron's numbingly banal script. But the film moves like a snail. And even within his fantasy context, the characters behave inappropriately regularly. (Reporters who routinely leave the story of a lifetime? An apparent angel living on Earth? Out of sight?) Someone forgot to tell the romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt, brilliant in so many other films, is not Tom Hanks. The movie's "climax" redefines the word. Ephron can shoot for the sky here, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long, long walk through the cinema heel.
