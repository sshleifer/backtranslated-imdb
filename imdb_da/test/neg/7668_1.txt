This movie is an absolute disgrace! I thoroughly enjoyed the original airport and I can't believe how the same people could produce this twaddle for nine years. First of all, the play is bad. The original had actors who had previously made quality film (non-disaster) movies, but this uses actors who have already made the disaster film (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). Also, George Kennedy's character Patroni seems to be promoted very quickly. He is now the leader in the movie, but his character is not strong enough to carry it off: he has lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970), and the character is now just boring. Did I mention the plot? Is it at all credible that someone would send a missile after Concorde ?? NONE!!! There are too many loose ends; scenes that have no relevance to the plot. The scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, theft in the German at Charles De Gaulle airport is two such scenes. Both would be interesting - if they had anything to do with the actual story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why does Patroni open the window and burn a flare in the other plane? Why does Robert Wagner's character kill himself? (He must have another stupid and costly way Why is there no query for the missile almost blowing up in Concorde? Why are the back projectors so bad? (It looks like a cartoon missile follows Concorde, even though it works well when the plane lands in Paris) Why does Patroni think he's in an airplane simulator? (When he turns over Concorde) Why does he get a complete welcome in the plane's cabin after fearing the passengers, and why is it ending so poorly if it can be called an end in it The whole blessing given to the young couple on the plane of the girl's trainer is shmaltzy, the man playing the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is simply stupid. When Susan Blakely is on her winter garden, and when she tells Wagner that she still loves him, it is quite terrible, this movie should have been climax of previ ous three airport movies: instead t it is a devilish, sub-moronic, complete and complete waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" !!!!!!! Remember when Patroni asks the French pilot if he has ever landed on his stomach? This movie surely makes the stomach flop and lands flat on its pointed nose ...
