I have recently seen a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about horrible! Any movie that Ed Wood has ever posted resembles Oscar's material to this ridiculous tosh. To be fair, a few lines from the script will live long in memory like "These people (cannibals) do not buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get fresh every day from people like you or me" Classic! The crazy 'Jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the movie he really looked like a nutter. I think he was the only actor not to be called in (badly) if these Italians are to have American characters in their films, why don't they make the Americans duplicate in the dialogue instead of English people trying their best to sound like Annie Oakley. I give this 3 out of 10, I give it three because it really is more fun than most comedies these days.
