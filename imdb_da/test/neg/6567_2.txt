While Star Trek, Motion Picture was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is simply poor. In this horrible sequel, the crew goes ashore when they get an emergency signal from the federation that ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon homeland) have been kidnapped by a dismissed Vulcan bent on his quest to venture a star ship into the big barrier. There he hopes to find God. Through mystery and bad writing, he persuades many of the company's top officers to betray Kirk and grab the ship. They enter the great barrier and find a planet where they meet a god-like alien. This is so bad, it's hard to figure out where to start. The core is a good idea that has never really been developed. The reason goes nowhere instead of where no one has gone before. It's almost like the authors had no idea how to end this failure. The action scenes do not have the excitement of Kahn's anger, the philosophy is boring, and humor is outdated. Now I want to focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. The majority of the focus is on him, Spock and McCoy, but do not give the others enough to do. In addition, Shatner is usually guilty of overcoming in previous movie and television spots, but he is simply poor in this. Now Kirk is rowdy, a practical jokers and stupid. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders who sing the song, "Row Row Row Your Boat" in a round of a bonfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.
