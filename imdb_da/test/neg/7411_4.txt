A big waste of time is all you get out of this bag. I rented this in hopes of an exciting movie with maybe some credible scenes, but boy was I ever disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101" or something like that. Well, get away from this movie. It numbers you to death. Don't be afraid of big foot, be afraid of this shit !!
