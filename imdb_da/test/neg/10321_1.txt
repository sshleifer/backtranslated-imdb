I checked this for free at the library and I still feel ripped off. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually in it, but only in five scenes totaling up to just under 5 minutes, and even those are quite painful to see. The rest of the movie is so bad that you will spend most of the hope that it will end soon, but only if you are one of those people who must complete a movie when they start it. Everyone else will just shut it down. Don't worry, you won't miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming you were fooled into seeing this because her name is plastered on the case) are basically parroting other characters lines like this dialogue: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny , please tell me what's going on. "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I don't know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" Whaddaya means you don't know? " <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - it's something to do with my dad." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means your father?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - he's ready for something or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa, I don't know." <br /> <br /> (moments later) Danny - "Some comrades of my dad ..." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya thinks army mates?" <br /> <br /> See what I mean? <br /> <br /> Bottom line - just say no.
