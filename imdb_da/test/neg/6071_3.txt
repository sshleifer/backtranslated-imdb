Terrible! <br /> <br /> Despite Ed Harris, Diane Krug's great performance and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the movie is by far the worst I saw about a composer and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictitious things to upgrade a biography that otherwise might not be so "charming". This was done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this B copy here is a mistake. Beethoven had a strong personality, but was a sensible artist. Here in this movie, however, he looks much more like Mike Tyson! I also wonder if, despite his deafness, he heard all those whispering in the last scenes (can be a cochlear implant?). I prefer to hear the ninth on a CD with some fine maestro. Today, most modern Viennese orchestras perform. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
