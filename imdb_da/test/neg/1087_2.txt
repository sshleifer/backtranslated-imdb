This hokey movie left me moaned after almost any exchange of dialogue or plot complication. Patricia Arquette, although gratifying to look at, gives a weird achievement from her usual mediocrity. My friends and I have coined the term "Beyond Rangoon" to mean something really bad. A low point for Boorman.
