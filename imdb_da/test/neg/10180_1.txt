This is the third movie in a month I've seen, didn't go as expected. The first two are The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, none of which gave any new ideas about who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I have always had a fascination with UFOs and were so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO study that was not a comedy. But after approx. 30 minutes it went awful. <br /> <br /> I could have stood for the actor, the camera angles, the stereotypes if there was only a good story about chasing UFOs, but no one here. I'm not saying there was anything wrong with the subject, but Netflix is ​​pushing this movie as a UFO skeptic and a UFO believer investigating several places. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking halfway through. Can't believe I wasted so much time with this one. Please make the same mistake I made.
