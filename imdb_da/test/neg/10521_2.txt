This stinker is in mystifyingly frequent rotation on a channel here, and I have found myself looking in horror over and over again. The script is like something you would get with friends over many too many drinks, and the production values ​​match admirably. It is supposed to be a children's movie, but has a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; the star's dog has a lack of star quality, which is only reflected by the other actors; and it generally seems to be filmed in someone else's backyard (the climatic football matches contain no more than three dozen extras that unfortunately hunt in the background). It's even all with a budget-run-out voice-over sequence, when the story, to its relief, simply stops. High Raters here must either be the producers - or most extras from the football match!
