Those born to Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers often found neither. The beautiful country is the story of such a child, Binh, rejected by his rural village and struggling to find his American father. The movie begins with green and wild land, but falls into ugly sweaty ugly and boredom. The significant talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in meaningless and ill-conceived roles aboard the rusty cargo vessel carrying Binh, and are dying brother over the sea with what appears to be bullets of stormy seas. New York City offers slave labor and clich√© grades. Although it is very uneven from the start, the great curiosity in this movie is the last segment. Nick Nolte gets top billing among cast. I told funny that he would probably be in the final scene and not far from the truth. When the journey brings Binh to Texas and his father, the film takes a calm and tight simplicity. A foolish cohabitation connects these two men to a family of father and son. The ninety-minute minutes of waste we've just seen are rewarded with a deep and subtle performance from Nolte as they slowly interact. The credits rolled and I was surprised to see the names of Badland's executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas native Terrence Malick.
