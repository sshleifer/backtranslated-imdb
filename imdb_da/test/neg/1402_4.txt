I just finished seeing this terribly depressing drama and realized that in view of the latest dramas like these, the only ones that could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing but tragic. I would suggest how uncomfortably defeatist and counterproductive this conclusion is, even though relationships and prospects like those presented in this film are basically based to some extent. But in reality, I realized that these movies have made the very decision of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out, they have only been over and over again in one or the other. another kind of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life (much of what existed in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations ever made so subtle), replacing it with the "reality" of how things actually are. What we see is no longer the dysfunctional, but actually a normal existence and set of circumstances that actually existed all the time but which we may have previously been unaware of and therefore have ignored or at least denied. <br /> <br /> Only problem is that too many movies have tried to make this point. And by doing so in almost identical form. When I read the synopsis for the movie, I immediately thought of 'Ice Storm.' While looking at the Travis family's depressing lifelessness, which seemed to endure repeated emotional bereavement, I immediately recognized 'American Beauty'. And in some respects, the interaction between the parents and the middle child, Tim, turned similarities to 'Igby Goes Down'. 'Imaginary Heroes' may be a novel experience, perhaps a refreshing one, which is considered an honest character that, as mentioned earlier, is often not allowed to exist in the family films (which is idiotic to think anyway, considering that we were already seeing these relationships shown in films like "Ordinary People" already in 1980 and going back even further than that). But for the well-known viewer, these movies cannot offer anything new. In fact, they have become a rather tired testimony to too many filmmakers who might try to explore the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into a family (and here it stretches to neighbors and friends). In fact, 'Imaginary Heroes', the latest in this genre (I think there have been enough movies to accurately declare it a 'genre'), smashes so many disasters and surprises in a family that they would win gains for a daytime talk show host. It's the story of a family tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion. The youngest son knew it, the father was in a drowsy and dazzled by the push for competitiveness in his all-star son. And it is not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man. <br /> <br /> The proof, it is no less entertaining (to some extent, for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while), and the performance is quite good, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But I certainly hope that future filmmakers who want to add to the commentary to fight for family relationships (who randomly or not always appear to be middle-class white suburbs) intend to offer something new through material and insight. I shouldn't see any difference (and therefore no purpose) otherwise.
