I'm a big fan of surreal art, but this movie from Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a lifelong wrath against the Catholic Church and was delighted to try to offend Catholics in rather stupid ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you would expect from a smart aleck 18 year old in movie class. The last few minutes of the movie, which has nothing to do with anything else, is a final nose-thumb on religion. <br /> <br /> If you read "scholars" about this slow, occasionally entertaining movie, it's about how the church and society blame sexual oppression. If it really is meant, then Bunuel expresses it in the most round fashion. The key male character is an eerie brutal who loves to kick dogs and knock blind men down the street and who mentally switches billboard ads to strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the fault of the church (to disturb its love), or is it just a dunk? I am voting for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had many personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones due. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments where you might cry: "Ah! Surrealism!": A cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out of a window (a bad model), a man shredding a feather pillow , a woman flushes a toilet while we see pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit ... hard to tell in B / W). The rest is forgettable complacency. Unfortunately, Bunuel still sought the same bogey men throughout the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm ...). If you are interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau's early work.
