This movie is amazingly bad. It was on television when I voted for an action scene and chuckled away at the cheesy macho dialogue and waited for Leslie Nielsen to be seen. It took me a few minutes to realize that it was not a comedy it was supposed to be taken seriously. What is to be remembered is that someone actually sat down and wrote this movie, and worse yet - other people financed it and gave it the green light. Rutger Hauer obviously does not read film scripts before signing up, whether it or he has some seriously bad claims to pay. <br /> <br /> Oddly, this movie is so poor that you find yourself staring at it and wondering how it was actually funded and how a TV Channel must have paid money for the rights to fly it. The dialogue between hero and baddie while trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful, with a dialogue that resembles that generated by a Texas Instruments "Speak & Spell". <br /> <br /> The Hollywood ATM at it's worst. Funny though.
