... when they are formed into another language. Let's face it: Neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And considering the campy lines they should pronounce this is a loose solution. Any kind of voiceover is certainly an improvement (and in fact - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor point. The action is bad. The accelerated battle sequences are pathetic. Nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious in relation to the flowing movement of the movement exhibited by the child (who has undoubtedly had some martial arts training) and to the athletics shown by Sandahl Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures are nice, I have to give it. The dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. But more often than not, the plaster is too clear. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not worth seeing. Even 'Conan the Destroyer' is better than this (although only marginally). I would have very much seen Bergman as Red Sonja as she was supposed to be, but I doubt it could have saved this movie - okay. <br /> <br /> 3/10
