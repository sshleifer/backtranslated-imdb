This movie really starts out. We know Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to correct Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Robert's fine acting convinces us here soon. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy that, regardless of what has happened to good character development, it is negated by cavities, inconsistencies, and precisely boring motion pictures. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm a sucker for bold and far out. Examples I like include "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye." Along with the fact that I must admit that this movie was well-acted, it even surprises me that I cannot recommend this movie. The complete collapse of this movie is about midway through the film. All comedy is instantly lost and the movie becomes dark. Afterwards, the film goes along. The film's attempt to make the comedy roll again does not succeed. More surprises are waiting for the viewer and they are darker still. <br /> <br /> To be sure, blending drama with comedy can be a formula for success. But with this movie, the result is about as successful as "new coke".
