I was very excited when I watched this movie in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Along with Elephant and a few others, I thought that the issue of US gun violence / culture would be treated intelligently and in a way convincingly for movie goers. The press release promised (in not so many words) a `` Red Violin '' for the mass of the arms, something to get us to consider our NRA-shoot-up thinking in this country. <br /> <br /> Having waited until 9:15 to be set for a 9:00 screening (what technical difficulties they would have encountered, I was out of town), we were finally hit the room for to watch the movie on DV (where did the announced 35MM print?). I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is a disgusting mess. We get the "gun" in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker" I've ever seen (and I know more than a few). The movie then lapses in irrelevant "character development" only because the characters are either a. Stereotypes, b. Losers, c. Stereotypical losers and / or d. It takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and when we are there, we want the in-house conversations between the couple and / or motorcyclists and farmers brokers. <br /> <br /> The movie finds the conclusion but not without leaving any clich√© untouched. I didn't care about the white trash cans that came in contact with the gun, and the depiction of minority characters should make the NAACP cry immediately. All of these people will hunt for a gun because they are at the bottom of the social trash pile, and would look for an option where it was found. Placing the action on a level would at least have given some soul searching on the side of the character. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is lifted unfulfilled. The floor plan was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt could have been a strong piece. But because of either a poor manuscript, direction or both, it is an unpleasant mess that must be ignored at all costs. My bigger question is who in the FFR thought this was competition material. Ask it better at Showtime at. 3:00. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
