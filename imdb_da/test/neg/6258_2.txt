This movie was one of those films where it completely fooled me into thinking it was a cheesy 80's slasher flick based on the cover, but it wasn't. It might have been one of the worst slasher movies I've ever seen. The picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie; In fact, it didn't involve a chainsaw. Not even the roofline fits the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads flying to a deserted cabin, in the cold forest, for a weekend holiday. But things get extra cool when they start being murdered by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is in search of a dangerous killer. I name the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The play. Boy was it cheap and terribly bad. It felt unnatural and it seemed like it was very scripted. None of the players seemed to be trying to do good intentions and therefore they seemed stupid and tired. There was bad performance of all the characters in the movie, so I don't want to point out certain people, but I would say that stoners did a terrible job, as well as the police and cheerleaders, who are not a surprise. br /> <br /> 2. The plot. This story had created a perfect story for good ol 'fashion slasher flick, but instead peppered it with plot holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and a general stupid back story to the killer's intentions. There were big plot holes, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and still there in the group of girls when it happened? The ex-con earned virtually no purpose in the movie except being an unusable plot unit. There was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled through it all, even for a b-movie or my taste it was a little too much. As for the killer's intentions, let's just say it was stupid, and it makes no sense why she / he kills young girls. Plus, there were also some very predictable killings that I saw about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was okay, it was certainly not the worse lighting I've seen in a movie, but there were points where it should be dark, but it looked more like the afternoon. The house seemed darker with the lights on, so with the lights off. The camera's work was average, it didn't have any good start-ups or amazing pans or zooms, thought it got the job done, building some excitement with its framing. Overall, this film in the Square's feeling, character development and performance was a huge disappointment and waste of my time. What I thought would have been a big slasher flick turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The action was really bad and wood, there was hardly any meaning in the plot and there was no feelings for this movie. But the technical aspect of this movie saved it to me, because if the camera worked or the lighting was bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and popped into something else. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy b-movies as well as those who follow cult classics because this movie is definitely. I would partially recommend this movie to those who enjoy the 80s slasher flicks. But for me, this movie was pitiful and utterly horrible.
