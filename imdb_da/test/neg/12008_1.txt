What a horrible movie. Full of clich√©s, confusing scenes, very bad plays and a scary script. It's hard to believe the same guys who wrote The People vs. Larry Flint, and Man on the Moon wrote this waste. Man, this makes my list of top 10 worst movies of all time. Didn't this guy, this instructor, if you could call him that, realize that the first problem child was bad enough? Don't make a successor for it !! ?? Fantastic the piece of trash movie like this can prove to children let alone be released! 1 out of 10 * s
