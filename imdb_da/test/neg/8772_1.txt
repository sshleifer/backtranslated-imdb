One of the reviewers here wrote: "Good acting, great special effects, great <br /> <br /> placement. Even better end." All I can say is, "Ugh." This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian-considered extremely conservative of many people I know. So what to say is not pre-stressed by <br /> <br /> the "Christian content" of the movie. I don't want to bash it because it's Christian. I will give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. Scripture is bad - over the top, way of preaching, and much of the "preaching" thing is simply irrelevant to history. It just does bad scriptwriting. Whether I agree with the screenwriter's belief, it is irrelevant - make a good script that flows well, stays on track and is credible. The action was at best amateurish. But hey, when you throw amateurs, you get <br /> <br /> amateur performances. Dirk Been may have been on "Survivor", but it shows <br /> <br /> requires ZERO functioning capability. Playing on his name and reputation selling units is in bad taste. Throw in unknown who can act and you get a much better movie. The effects were terrible. The scene with the shotgun and the subsequent fall in the stars was embarrassing to see. And what was so good at the end? It didn't make sense. Yes, I know what Tim Chey was about, but it missed the big-time mark. I bought this movie and expected so much more based on reviews and <br /> <br /> misinformation on their website. And even though I was hoping for more, I got what I always get when I see "Christian" movies - a sub-budget, poorly written, pathetic act, badly produced bit kaa. Maybe someday somebody will finally come up on the record with an end-time movie, so well-written, and as good as Gibson's "Passion ..." was. 2/10 stars.
