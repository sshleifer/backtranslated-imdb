Remember when Rick Mercer was fun? 22 minutes was a good show when Rick Mercer was on it, and Made In Canada was also a great show. Speaking to the Americans was also a fun special. But as my friend said, "Rick Mercer woke up one day and was not fun anymore" I think the day was when Rick Mercer Report aired. What is the purpose of this show? Rick Mercer reads wacky fake headlines, displays pictures of bad sheds that people mail in and then uses approx. 20 minutes of the 30 minute show somewhere and just talking to people who hope to say something witty or wise enough to come on TV and maybe even make some laughs. We should be interested to see that Rick Mercer visits a gym and then tries to make some of their moves and then gently sucks while trying desperately to be "funny". Rick Mercer got old or just lost interest or is just not fun anymore. Even his classic rant bits have lost all their bites and humor. You can say it about CBC comedies in general, but because for many years have they been Air Farce on TV to deliver the same kind of useless jokes?
