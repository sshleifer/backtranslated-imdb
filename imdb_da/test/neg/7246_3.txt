I happened to have seen this movie this morning on TCM. Very bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the movie. The only highlight of the movie was watching tender young Rita Moreno (23 years old), playing a teenage Indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50s. She reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), just an innocent Lolita. She jumps up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper, almost as if you'd expect her to be a chewing gum that falls over this old man, willing to give him something, as he pretends to be an obstacle to him. Any man in the fifties who had a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be crazy not to exploit her. It is too bad that the censorship board back when this film was released did not allow more of an extension of a character like Rita Moreno's. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is Rita Moreno's appearance in the movie.
