The Disney Studios remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic relates to a clever feline that leads an F.B.I. agent for a kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci gives an unclear, light-me-outta her performance as the cat's owner and feed is played by Doug E. Doug, embarrassingly over-the-top, as a human cartoon. A couple of rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and original "Cat" cast member Dean Jones) are funny and the formula plot still has some juice left in it, but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious, and the cat is so lifeless that it is strictly DOA <br /> <br /> * from ****
