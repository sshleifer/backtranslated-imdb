Okay, I agree with all Barney haters on this page. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and unpleasant, and the show is very obscure and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But what crossed me the most is how Barney presented gays, lesbians and bisexuals on his show when talking about same-sex parents and relatives. It wouldn't be that much of a problem if the creators of this show didn't use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink, and not all lesbians are ugly and male with a breast that fits their abdomen. As a bisexual woman, I just think it's terrible for a children's show. If this was South Park, I wouldn't mind it because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who look at Barney are young children or disabled people who usually cannot distinguish the imagination from reality. <br /> <br /> And now I'm thinking that Barney comes as a nasty homosexual stereotype. Let's see he doesn't have a girlfriend, he's pink and wears clothes with sequins (yes that's true) on it. If you claim to be for the rights of gay and bisexual individuals, stop making fun of them in front of people who know nothing better. If Barney was on the face and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the show would be pulled out of the air before you know it. <br /> <br /> I give this show a negative out of five. Do not show your children such hate crap. There are children's shows out there that are so less offensive.
