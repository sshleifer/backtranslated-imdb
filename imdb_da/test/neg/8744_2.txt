This joins the endless line of corny, predictable 50's sci-fi shlock out there. As usual, it's pretty bad. There is not much of a plot that I could detect, and the disturbance of the leaders only adds to the unintentional grin. The title is also misleading. Capturing this on MST3K is probably the only way to look it up and it is better back that way.
