How many English 101 students' versions of 1984 should America endure? "Yes, it's a great book, but a kind of downer. I know I'm writing one as everything works okay. I also want to replace Orwell's old, torn political insights from the thirties with my own obvious, informed statements of 1970" think, think, political insight ... Bad politicians, I'm a genius! And there will be clones that they do by themselves for some diabolical reason ... I want to work on it. No, Bob Sullivan, author of this story, will not. This is really all you are to blame. You could have stopped them early and said, "Guys, with our budget and ability to act, I thought more about romantic comedy, or we could move away from taking ourselves so seriously and making a campy spoof this tired, familiar genre of movie ." Have you done this though Bob? No, you didn't, and you've had 28 years to think about it. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to be so defiant. Sorry, I called you Bob. Of course, you have to live with this error much longer than I have. Some blame should really go to Ron Smith who helped you customize the script. He could have stopped you at any time. You were young and naive, and he took advantage of you. Now he ranks the charts for video games, and you, Bob, who knows what you're doing. I'm sorry if it sounds hard Bob, but that's it. You were sold upriver by Hollywood hotshots. As if Ron wasn't enough, Michael Bay also watched your movie, and without even asking for rights or anything, added some explosions to your concept and changed it to "The Island". What I think is the most obnoxious part of all that, with a little eye like that, your script could easily be good enough for a great Hollywood production that I hated just as much as this movie and didn't feel sorry for it at all. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that things worked this way for you. Ron and Michael walked over you and left you a showcase of a man who is the height of filmwriter greatness, will be a joke at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't focus on it even though Bob, because Karma works in mysterious ways and one day they pay for what they did to bad little Bob Sullivan.
