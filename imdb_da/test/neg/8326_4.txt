"Black Vengeance" is an alternative title for "Ying hung ho she" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I've just seen this on VHS along with the first part of the story "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also 1987. (The poster and 2 still images on the page is for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist) The fourth film is called "The Black Six". Strange, while the characters retain their original names in "Rich and Famous", "Black Vengeance" is Chow Yun-Fat character called Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry, and Andy Lau is called Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as copyright dates for both films. Maybe that was the year they were American-dubbed. According to the release dates given on IMDb "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous". Was there any reason to release the successor first? Despite some users' comments, I have had these movies, even though they are not among the best of CYF as "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled", which are truly amazing. But if one day I come across a 2-DVD set of "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero", I won't hesitate to buy it. Hopefully these comments are about "Black Vengeance", which was also for me, a mystery of where it belonged to Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.
