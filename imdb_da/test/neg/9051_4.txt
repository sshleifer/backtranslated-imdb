I love Umberto Lenzi's cops - ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS justified the Italian euro war phenomenon by actually managing to be a really good movie. Give him pistols, machines, some guys run around and talk hard and it's hard for him to miss. <br /> <br /> What a shame to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX? They could have been by anyone, really, and you see them with the feeling that he was under contract, was told what kind of movies were to be made, got a cast & crew and got a budget, deadline and script. Lenzi then went out and performed his films in the same way as a guy at McDonald's fixed a batch of French fries. Of the two, the EAT ALIVE is the more original - which is unique considering it has extensive footage copped from three other cannibal films - and easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, but not much. <br /> <br /> I want to let others outline the plot: What fascinated me about the movie is how staged it all looks and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this movie has as a kind of all-out attack on good taste . It is not, even if the film is an exercise in bad taste, complete with a title-earnings scene, where two of the beautiful supportive ladies are quite literally cut up and eaten alive by cannibals, which is the film's highlight. The problem is that Lenzi lets us have a good, long look at the cannibal party scene and it has the compelling ring of a 3rd season STAR DRAW episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots. And I don't know anything about anyone else, but if anyone splits off my person and eats them, I would not just lie there and see distress. <br /> <br /> My problem with the movie is perhaps that I have a great respect for Lenzi as the film maker, and again it could have been ruled by someone. All of your cannibal movie conventions are touched, but it never feels like they've been filmed with any real conviction, except trying to bully Ruggero Deodato out of the sandbox. The two directors must surely have knowledge of each other and either have some kind of juvenile rivalry or a real aversion to each other's work and a conscious need to raise them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN from DEIP RIVER, Deodato blew it away with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi fired back with the EAT ALIVE, Deodato blew him (and everyone else) away with the superior CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi fired a final dismissal salvo with CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi fired a final dismissive salvo with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is almost as realistic as the one Krazy Glu commercially, where the guy superglasts his hardness to a beam and hangs in midair. <br /> <br /> This movie is less desperate and a little more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss with everything sacred than FEROX, which remains as a kind of misguided attempt to arise CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. This is more of a mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a Jim Jones as a suicide cult - the cannibals seem to be added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the movie. I think fans of the genre will get a better impression of the movie than fans of Lenzi's movie looking for something new from the formidable director. It is not as entertaining as SLAVE OF THE CANNIBLE GOD, adventurous as its own MAN FROM THE DRIVER, and definitely lacks the wallop of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with the reused footage, belly-beating scenes of animal violence, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stagy wood methodology for film making and what you end up being an OK jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes and Umberto Lenzi was capable of much more . <br /> <br /> 4/10; Gore freaks will however go nuts.
