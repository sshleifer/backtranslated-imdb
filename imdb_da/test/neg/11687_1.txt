I've rented the movie because I'm very fond of war movies and on the cover image I've read "better than saving private ryan" .... mmmmm ... I was thinking cold! guys .... is just a ridiculous movie. Almost fun. Nothing to do with a proper war movie. I want my money back! Why do the folks lie ??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with the light .... but they didn't. Sorry about this ..... but the movie is horrible. Italians appear as "Mafia e mandolino" <br /> <br /> The American as stupid farmer the Germans as even more stupid farmer. <br /> <br /> The actor is ridiculous and unprofessional. <br /> <br /> please .... please ......
