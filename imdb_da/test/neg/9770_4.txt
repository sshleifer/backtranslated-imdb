I'm a big fight. As a story that is surreal, this movie could have been great (as large as it is rated by some here), but mixed with the actor (director and relatives plays great roles for economic reasons I reckon on) found here. .. even though it is called this act, not just a stretch of the word, it gives it a new meaning! A whole new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are into surreal movies (there are some that I really like, see for example the Japanese strange circus), you may overlook the errors (see above) and enjoy this more. After all, there are good ideas! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while you see this (along with a group of friends) almost all of us, you just couldn't stop laughing ... not the director's intention! Again, everyone has their own taste, as can be seen from the high rating of this movie, but I could only recommend the movie if you are aware of the work Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or is a fan of!
