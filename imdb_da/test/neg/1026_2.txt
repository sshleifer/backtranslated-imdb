Although there is very little plot and what is available, it is just improvisation. However, it was a good start from a new director without prior financial back-up and also a smart move from Andy Warhol to make his cimematic productions more negotiable and more friendly. In any case, this story of a street hawker relies too much on showing Joe Buck naked (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after a hundred times, and the interruption of the dialogue becomes very annoying halfway. This would have been a lot more entertaining or even dramatic if they made an everyday documentary of an actual male prostitute or hustler, instead of letting actors pose a nonsense plot and dialogue of their own.
