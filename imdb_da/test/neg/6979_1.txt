I endured this movie just to satisfy my curiosity. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever put through. I'm surprised this movie currently has a 7.5 star rating. The action is horrible, script is non existent, and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a fun movie, I can't remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you much more joy. Check out movies like the holidays or 27 dresses, these movies would provide a much more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope that more educated filmmakers are negative about this movie the way it really deserves it, goodbye makes it a more realistic assessment that other movie buffs could base their judgment on. Come on people, let's be fair to all concerned and give those involved in this movie a true reflection on what they've produced - an extremely mediocre image that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
