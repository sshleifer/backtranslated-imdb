Ridiculous thriller where a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent her action against them. Interesting premise could make a good movie, but one is just lame and far fetched. Drilling with one end conciliatory, just to say the least. Mrs. Mirren is trying to give some dignity to this misfire, but even she - a good actress, without a doubt - could save this waste. I give this a 4 (four).
