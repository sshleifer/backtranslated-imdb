Another entry in the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenre. You know the drill: young hotshot with hubristic flaws (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to jump on a fluttering career by unlocking Pacino's coattails - hi, it worked for Keanu and Colin, not that?) Is discovered by glamorous and lovely corrupt character (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot teaches from Father Figure all the in-and-out of a lucrative yet degrading career (this time it is football handicapping). Father Figure puts Young Hotshot with money and hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent situation is at a collision course with dissolution and despair. . . That is, until Young Hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the Father's figure and all or almost everything he stands for. (Clearly, Stone's * Wall Street * basically sets the ground rules for the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenre.) <br /> <br /> We must also take these ridiculous Pacino movies as a parallel to reality. Once again you know the drill: The Living-Legend Actor demonstrates its undisputed superiority over a subordinate young actor. The latter can carry and laugh through the process, but he must admit that he is not going to get any of the good lines, much less get a chance to chew big scenes before the execution. Now it should be said that there are actually two good films in the Pacino-As-Mentor cannon: * The scent of a woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, it was nevertheless a one-man show; In the latter case, Pacino had met his fight as a stage stealer in Johnny Depp's person. But the two films were serious, not just a showboating exercise for showboating. Pacino has made sure that his younger fellows in the movies since Brasco * are not as close as charismatic as Depp. That way none of this speaks very well about the Living-Legend Actor. Pacino, like his contemporary De Niro, has spent the last 10 or 15 years on his laurel. * Two for the money * is the worst example yet, worse than than * Devil's Advocate *, who at least had the virtues of presenting a nude Connie Nielsen and being chronologically ahead of this movie. Well, that's what happens when you're crowned King too desperately early - just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I have seen too many Al Pacino movies with the same plot - and the same overhang from the star - being charitable longer. Did I say "none of this speaks good"? In fact, it is humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying audience. No one will accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a shakespeare actor, but he himself does not deserve the role of secondfiddle to this unacceptable old show-off, with the added implication that he, McConaughey, will never measure up to the Greatness It's Al. <br /> <br /> I have not wasted space on the plot information. If you want a synopsis, IMDb gives a summary, but I think I've made a rather comprehensive summary in my introductory section. Basically you've seen this movie before. Often. The special environment of * Two for Money * is the seedy world (underworld, really) of sports handicapping. Pacino runs an office with "bet advisers" - that is, intermediaries between you and your bookie - and even has a cable TV handicapping show, co-hosted with several of his top guys. One thing that the movie got right was the veil of this type of show. . . but a detail they died was the constant use of the words "gamble" and "gambling". If you've ever seen ProLine or other shows of similar ilk, you'll NEVER ever hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word "gamble". They ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their choice. . . But if you were off, Mars says, you have no idea what to do with those who choose. "Gamble" is the F word on sports-disabled television shows - strictly prohibited. <br /> <br /> Gambling is against the law you know. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
