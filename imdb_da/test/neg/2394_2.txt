The prerequisite is interesting and the cast does the best, but the script and the direct action are so poor that it is not surprising that this film was buried - which fits the manuscript. When I saw this, I couldn't decide what was worse, the manuscript or the director. The actors are over the top, the art direction resembles a Disney movie, the music is constructed and the mood is so sweet that it gives viewers cavity. It's a bad attempt to imitate "FOur Weddings And A Funeral". If you want to see comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how bad direction can make a story for cavity sweetness, it's good to see.
