It is often difficult to decide what the best movie you have ever seen, as it may vary by genre, preference for actors / actresses or even the mood you are on a particular day! That said, this movie is, in my opinion, the WORST movie I have ever seen !! I thought the play was terrible (was there anyone?), The plot was just idiotic, and the props were completely fake. Could a lower budget production be created without being amateur production? I do not think. Even the friends I watched the movie agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented, and to this day we are still talking the night we watched this movie.
