I think this is a disappointing successor. I miss many of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like it because of the fact that not even half of the original voices are left to make the characters. A lot of personality was lost in Charlie, and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface was in the first. If you are a great ADGTH fan as I am, it is worth seeing just to see how the story continues, but don't expect to be 5 stars in your book.
