Avida is a word of words that blends life and zeal, but I personally think that this movie was overwhelmed by the ambition and not right to its title. It brings together a set of unpleasant characters united by incredible links. Moreover, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a little pathetic. The rest of it was a set of pictures ... an interesting, but not enough to make this a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should be a comedy, but I probably haven't noticed it! The film's nonsense and caricature character is actually the only good thing about it, but when it draws on an on and on, it is no longer tolerable. I have to say that I struggled hard to continue to see it to the end and I'm still not sure it was worth it ...
