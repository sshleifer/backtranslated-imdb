I start spraying the movie first. Remove Abbott and Costello from the casting and you have a hard-colored film, stiff cardboard from the casting department, poorly doubled sound (especially during song!) And annoying dialogue (eg listen to the line "Mr. Dinklepuss" ad infinitum). Of course, some studio hacks thought they could cash in on Disney's CLASSIC presentation of "Mickey and the Beanstalk", but perhaps the audience was either more happy again (unlikely) or stuck in a dual function (more likely). Even children should feel offended by showing this movie to them. A total waste of celluloid. Now about the performance of Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott always played the same man, and of all accounts the nicer person was out of the set. On radio his character was usually the smooth fast talker, and it was especially fun when his speed made him fobble his lines and smooth over the mistakes. In the films he still plays the right man, but is more of a con artist. Not that he is bad at it, but the sign has been played to perfection by Groucho Marx. The real travesty of the duo on film is Lou Costello. Again he was fun on the radio. He played a character that was a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slower! He was also slippery with the lines and made me laugh when he wanted to ad lib at Abbot's fault. On film I do not know if it was his decision or not, but in the film his character becomes a shady imitation of Stan Laurel, which again became even more eerie by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? He was fun on the radio when he was a smart guy, but here he becomes a child-like character that looks like he curls up for the cameras in every shot. This characterization appears in every movie they do and brings only one spot to the reputation they had on the radio. What is left for their movie career is a bad (very, very bad) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been much more fun if they had played their radio characters instead of articles of stock casting.
