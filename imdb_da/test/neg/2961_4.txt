I've seen Shallow Grave many years ago, and * it * was one of the movies I kept in mind for a very long time. It was intense from the beginning to the end and with lots of sudden turns. But all of these made sense. <br /> <br /> I can't tell the same about Dead Bodies. Above the title is a subtitle that claims it is "even better than Shallow Grave". This is a big lie. Dead bodies lose strength and become far less convincing during the film. <br /> <br /> For example, two supporting signs turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first seemed to be. It could work as a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. I could see it coming a few minutes before, and * it * is a big difference with the little tomb. <br /> <br /> Another thing I must mention is that characters in this movie often do not respond very realistically. They behave so often when the film comes to its end. <br /> <br /> I would have found it much more interesting if some of the characters would have been completely innocent without knowing what was going on. It would have been better for contrast with, for example, Tommy and his friend who have to carry a * big * secret with them. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reasons, the decision makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides. It doesn't work in a movie like this. The end felt very much like an open end. It left me with a dissatisfied feeling. I was expecting a lot more of it. <br /> <br /> First, I would have given this movie six stars because it's not quite a bad movie. I liked to see it. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> But sometimes I saw some really bad actors and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end, I stick to four stars this time. And because it turned out to be a mistake that I spent my time and money on it. Unlike Grave Tombs, I'll probably forget Dead Bodies very soon. It's just not such a special movie. The occupants could have done a much better job with this movie. It's a shame they didn't.
