I'm the kind of person who never ever sees animated movies, but I'm making an exception for Thumbelina and Swan Princess. Being completely in love with the first part of the series, I bought this and sat down to see it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I had spent money to buy it. I finished the movie and all I can think of is HORROREN !!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, very hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy another of this horrible movie. The songs made me want to tear my ears out of my head. The dialogue was so boring, I felt frustrated and annoyed every time someone opened his mouth. The villain was ridiculous, and I felt that Derek and Odette would eventually die ... and I was completely in love with them from the first movie. I have to try to suppress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is a song in the movie where there are a number of flashbacks for the first movie. The difference in the animation between the two is made very obvious, and I began to yearn for the first and wish I would never put my eyes on the third. Do yourself and favor yourself and don't play your time.
