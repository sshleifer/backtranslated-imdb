I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The reason is your average monster movie, where it kills a few people, the mayor / boss doesn't believe it, and they fight it in the end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, movie quality is very good and New York's setting is impressive for a budget movie - unlike a small coastal city. The action is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, mainstage in a monster movie are ridiculous, and the addition of a random bus load of children to the plot halfway just gets weird. The end is just bad. <br /> <br /> In summary, when you have a chance to see this, don't do it - there will be something better at it. <br /> <br /> RTC "Real horror movies don't have a PG rating"
