Robert Downey Jr. In a 17th century gem and dress was enough to make me shake, but I couldn't believe that a great actor like Sam Neill actually participated in this movie. The whole thing was incredible. I especially like Merivel's "cure" for the crazies. They dance ... and hi presto! everyone is happy and they are all better! I guess I just didn't like the character Merivel too much. Therefore, it was cool to see a whole movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon to a big doctor. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure either, but I didn't think the plague as well as the famous fire in London took place simultaneously.
