Single, interrupted, middle-class wife in the midst of a divorce seeks comfort to reflect on her immediate future. At some kind of bed and breakfast by (well literally in the sea) the sea, for some odd reason she goes under the owner. Enter lonely, arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest at the inn in the ocean. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You will never guess these two harvests immediately in love. A tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The subplotters in this melodrama give little or no meaning. The location, photography is fine. Gereer remains one of the most overrated actors in the cinema and does not disappoint. Mrs Lane needs the money, but phones in her part with grace.
