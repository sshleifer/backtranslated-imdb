I just caught this movie on TCM and can understand why George Murphy went into politics if this were the best MGM could earn for him. It is so slow that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come out. It featured two of my favorite players in Eve Arden (totally wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the movie), but what really hit me was that the leading lady Frances Gifford went through 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) Without change the expression on her face - her weak scene was comical. John Hodiak played his role OK, but the manuscript let him and the rest down very badly. I gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography. It would have been in the first half of the program when dual functions had passed.
