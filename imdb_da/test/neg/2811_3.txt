I have not seen other films by Antonioni, and the people who saw this with me agree that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works. Perhaps if I had seen other things from him, I would have enjoyed this one and know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep questions about social relations, emotions, reality in relation to fiction, but it is very often done in the most wisest ways in which the characters speak as if the speeches delivered, walk back and forth, compiling statements rather than to have dialogues. The screenwriters seem to be so worried that we don't get the point they prefer to tell instead of showing. <br /> <br /> Second, the film has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow movies are made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like) but for that to succeed, we need to find the characters so engaging or The story is so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond The Clouds, where the first episode seems to be infinite, and the relationship between John Malkovich's "reality" and the love stories "fiction" is sometimes fluid, others sudden and others confusing.
