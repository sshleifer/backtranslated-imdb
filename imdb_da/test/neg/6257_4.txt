"Based on a joke once told by Jim Wynorski" ... that's what I've read at the end of the final credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski must have a horrible sense of humor! This movie is horrible, really. I loved the first two chapters of The Slumber Party Massacre series; the third film was completely useless but quite visible to this piece of shit! There is not even a Driller Killer and the plot, the play, the characters, the rankings, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reason to see this turkey is the girls: if this movie was a porn, I think it would have worked really much better! The movie is also missing: The first scene (the one in the tent) could be bloody, and the scene with the headless guy knocking on the door lasted a second! Some moments of small voltage cannot store a non-existing plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only bearable character in this movie! Oh ... there's a bitch with Brinke Stevens, who performed "Linda" in the first Slummer Party Massacre: The police disturb her knowing more about the killer; But what we get is just some footage from the first movie! Not a dialogue, neither a monologue nor anything from this still-traumatized adult girl who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), and gives us no trace of the killer! <Br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
