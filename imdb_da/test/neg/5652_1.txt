Nickelodeon has gone down to the toilet. They have children who say things like "Oh my God!" and "we are screwed" <br /> <br /> This show promotes hatred for people who do not look good or are not in the crowd. It says that sexual promiscuity is okay by having girls beat over casual boys. Not to mention the obese boy taking off his shirt. The protagonists at least scare someone out of the ordinary. Carly's friend Sam, who may be a lesbian, knocks out someone crossing his path, saying it's okay to be a b ** ch. This show has so much negativity in it that no one should see it! I give it a 0 out of 10 !!!
