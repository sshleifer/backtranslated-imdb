A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret laboratory experimenting with animals. When they arrive, they discover they are too late. Apparently, the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo, and yes you guessed it, a cobra that made them grow very large. I'm not sure this movie really needed or deserved to explain, as it is almost identical to the Curse of Komodo, which also sucked. The computer effects are as comic-like as ever, that the comodo roars like a dinosaur that really came on my nerves. Like Boa vs Python, this movie is not worth watching and is about as much fun to watch as it is to spike your hand to a table. Avoid!
