Okay, I admit I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I just have one thing for 6 'tall women with swords. I said so. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost every mistake you can make was made. You take a successful movie series (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects and the worst of all ... you put a sweet child in there for comic relief. This kind of thing nearly killed the Indiana Jones series you know. Sweet kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. At least Neilsen took the film seriously, though it didn't seem like others did. The reason had Schwarzenegger repeatedly to pull Red Sonja's fat out of the fire, and it significantly undermined her character. A warrior woman doesn't need a guy to get her out of a mess, it's her job! Not reusing the Conan character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never made the right mood, and its pacing was quite heterogeneous and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian, who had several story lines gracefully floating. When it comes to fantasy films, it's okay to have cheesy costumes, it's okay to have harryhausen style animation, it's okay to have stupid exorbitant sets that don't make sense, but having a horrible script is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a classic, but the script felt it was written by a 12-year-old.
