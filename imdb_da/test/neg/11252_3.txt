This movie came as a huge disappointment. The Anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the hasty introduction of a rather lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie all the loose ends. Unfortunately, it did not. It added more plot holes than it loosely, and confused more than clarified it. The animation and voice action was great, but with an idiotic plot, boring attitude (most of the movie doesn't even take place in boring WWII Earth instead of the Alchemy world) and disappointing end (Ed is useless for the rest of his days in a the world without alchemy, and he ditches Winry?), it was quite soft. Do yourself a favor - disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga.
