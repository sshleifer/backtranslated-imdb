Like many movies from the early days of the day, Cimarron must be seen more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. The hammy that appears by lead Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent film school. But while there are benefits of doubt, Cimarron is a badly shaped drama - an inflated movie that moves from independent order to independent sequence with a little dramatic impact. Officially, the movie is two hours and four minutes; It feels like four hours when you see it. There is no need to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early days. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best picture in Academy history and the prize should have been to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is barely remembered today and would have been remembered at all, if not for his Oscar win.
