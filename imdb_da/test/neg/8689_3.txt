Uncle Fred Olen Ray gives us a little of his Retromedia "goodness" in the form of this soft core Cinemax non-classic. <br /> <br /> A numeral pair looks like stones when they come across a whirling swirl a "black hole" that the intelligent dolts put it. Almost an attractive hole girl from a million years ago is entering the timeline and she goes into the future. Almost soon the other half also goes into the future and blows a path through the beds of the future. <br /> <br /> Again, Ray delivers an acceptable (but scarce) gossip that has horrible plays but some decent skin. Yes it is hardly titling but heh! If worse gets worse, it will cure you insomnia. <br /> <br /> S10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
