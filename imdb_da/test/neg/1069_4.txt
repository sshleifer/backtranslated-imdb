I'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it strong or have some kind of personal connection with the characters and story, but from an impartial standpoint it's not so well done. The film is about atypical anxiety-ridden teenagers, each playing a different stereotype that makes us think that is how it is to be a teenager. We get to see a bit of every teen's lifestyle, but the whole project came out just as pretentious to me, whether it be the constant low angle images of the woods in the wind or the black and white "interviews" with the students that were nothing new or original. in this movie and nothing I needed to see. Yes, it's about some strong subject matter, and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems almost an exact copy of Van Sants' "Elephant" (the one dealing with suicide, the other with a school recording). As said, some people will probably enjoy this, and the director / writer obviously had some inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close death, so it is great that the film was made with some heart in it, but I feel it is incredibly inefficient, and when dealing with material that can be so easy to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
