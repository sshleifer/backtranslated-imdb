This movie makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List." Tarantino and Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green Lighting a P.O.S. Just like this, regardless of the friendships involved, it's just a bad business. Larry Bishop must be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer / Director / Producer / Actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of these jobs. A vanity project went south, "Hell Ride" usually allows good actors to chew nature ... at least when the camera is not centered on the bishop's weak attempt to steal every scene he is in. (Which is basically all SCENE!) My last three words on "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
