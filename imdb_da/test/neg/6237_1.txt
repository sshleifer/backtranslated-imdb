What the hell was the point of this boring movie? It looked pretty interesting at the beginning, but quickly became flat on the face. it should be based on a true story, but to cry aloud there are no more scriptwriters left in Hollywood? man have i seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made, defoe can play almost anything and when i see that he is in a movie, i have no problem renting it but i start to wonder.redford also a great actor also slides; Maybe their hard up or just losing their senses. The dialogue was long and terribly heavy, especially at home. I wonder if the actors thought they had a hit here? maybe ... uh .. an Oscar?
