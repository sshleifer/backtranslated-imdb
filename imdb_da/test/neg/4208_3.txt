For quality films, this is not one of them. In fact, it's the first Chuck Norris movie I've seen, and I was left pretty underwhelmed. The battle scenes are slow and do not have much variation. Norris uses just a lot of round kicks on all the bad guys who come after him, which makes the games quite boring. The movie is also quite short, but for some reason the film doesn't even finish when it ends. It is a beautiful anti-climatic end. Still, I've seen many bad movies, and this is not one of the worst I've seen. It's worth seeing, I guess especially for Norris fans. Nor is there anything like seeing a group of rigs that seep into the desert, which in my opinion was the highlight of the film.
