I got this for my birthday in a box under the name of Broke Skull. Well, after seeing one on the DVD and was pleasantly surprised, I hit this sucker in. It was worse than I expected and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a horrible story of a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob and other bull crap. There were some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up. Now everyone has said that there were a lot of things, can anyone tell me was? I saw a bad effect of a head being crushed, brain tissue (or something ...), and blood coming from the penis area twice. I have to say that the part was the guy, getting his man's hood bitten off, made me twig, it was the only good thing about this movie. And the gay scene was just thrown in there for no reason. The action in this was terrible, really, it was blowing. The Asian chick was annoying, so the annoying Mexican girlfriend coming in to be killed. I say if you get this in a box set, that's fine, but don't spend any money on it at all.
