It is a long time for me and my wife to not see a boring thriller. It's finally not a moving story, and it's so slow that we almost fell asleep. This could instead be a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where the mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red dress or another mafioso can't stop thinking about her and so on. Okay, it should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me, you really miss something. We gave 4/10.
