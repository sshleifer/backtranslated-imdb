For the reasons I cannot begin to understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting the wolf's blood into his bad craftsman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro is transformed into an ugly (as ugly as a person with a bad wig and pointed teeth can be) killing animals. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to avenge himself on those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they, Dr. Cameron's nuttier than a fruit cake). Mad Monster is a boring and poorly made Poverty Row thriller. There is really only one positive I can write about in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the crazy scientist as well as anyone. Hans Dr. Cameron is a regular loony. He has no trouble killing; He has whole conversations with people who are not there and, as with most crazy scientists, he shatters in "the domain of God" (in fact I am not sure anyone accuses him of this, but it fits). But beyond Zucco there is nothing here to recommend. Everything else from the monster effects to the supporting end to the music is usually old bad. There are far better examples of Poverty horror from the 1940s than The Mad Monster.
