A man builds a hotel with a partner. He finds out that the hotel is over-insured. Things just get worse. This movie has a large number of scenes. They must have been gathered in one's sleep. It jumps around from place to place. It doesn't stay focused on anything for a very long time. The end starts on the Christmas morning with a hotel fire. It then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to daytime. The DVD audio track is terrible. It takes a fair plot and becomes the worst movie I've ever been to.
