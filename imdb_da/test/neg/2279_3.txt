Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this lesser excursion: a comedy about adultery and a melodrama on loss and sabotage. It results in a wincingly unfunny movie. Christine Lahti plays a crass, cynical television news reporter who makes friends with aerobic instructor Mary Tyler Moore and soon has dinner with Moore and her family - only to discover Marie's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret affair! Burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm for his dialogue, which is neither realistic nor effective (just more and more annoying, because nothing important ever seems to be said). Rail-thin Moore, who looks alarmingly weak in her leotard, has a brilliant smile, but doesn't convince like Danson's wife, and Danson gets stuck with a rough, ungrateful role (he's just there to be a cad). The film tries to cover all bases in a classic case of overreaching (the woman's role in the workplace, the television news biz, the cheating family man, the working wife and the mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendships, et al.), But nothing really comes out of these ideas, as Burns only half-heartedly examines the issues. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but has no purpose, and the heavy plotting just gets fouled. * 1/2 from ****
