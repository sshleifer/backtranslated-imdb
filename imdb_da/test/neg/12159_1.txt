As a Genghis Khan "fan" I looked forward to this movie. After devouring the Conn Igguld's epic novels about Genghis and reading up on lots of historical records, I feel I know something about the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends through this movie ... <br/> <br /> It turned out a deception. This film is practically made from start to finish. There are a few things that seem to be correct, but for the most part it is purely to believe in the authors. It doesn't have to be a problem, I like good entertainment like everyone else is sadly mostly boring. None of the greatness comes out in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie if you know anything about the subject.
