SPOILER - This movie gives away plot points and discusses the end. I hated this movie - mostly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically glorified this movie war and military technology - blowing things really well. We are led to cheer as the music swells, and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Rusksies to pieces. And no American soldiers put their lives on the line - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there is no hint of true human feeling in the movie, just smug, privileged people are sarcastic, feel superior and do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences. And when it comes to consequences, the film makes only a few small hits on what the Afghans' arming actually led to. I had read a previous draft of this script and it ended on 9/11 - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone awful. But it wouldn't let the audience feel good. This is a good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick.
