One of my friends once rented it and thought when Peter Fonda was in it, it couldn't be bad. WRONG! It's bad as everything can be. There is so much to laugh at and it's not the jokes. For example, Hawken goes into the woods, and when he comes out, he suddenly wears a completely different clothes! Where was the "instructor's" brain when he shot that scene?!? Probably the same place Fonda was when he went in to make this flick. It's really a shame you have to see such a fine actor stupid in this poor excuse for a movie. No performance in this film can be called acting. Jack Elam is brought in just to get the star number here, but all he does is look in a very dark and terribly shot scene in a kind of bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so godly that I would shoot her right to finish her misery and mine too. If I could give this a 0, I would. Shame that brand does not exist here. This really reminds you of a bad joke or an amateur movie made just for fun. This should serve as proof of how bad B-movies can get.
