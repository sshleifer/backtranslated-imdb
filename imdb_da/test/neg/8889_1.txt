This flick is so bad that it is without faith. Even for an independent low budget movie ... it's just good sucks. I can't even believe that even Troma would put such a crap. But LLoyd, come on, this goes far beyond the limits of every taste. It has some of the worst deals imaginable. I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who might have been so good ... Oh, wait, that's what they did. I mean, these characters have negative charisma. With some luck, the producer and director of this movie will have a huge karmic debt because of this cruelty. Which will the special effects of humans. Besides the horrible plays and the terrible special effects, the dialogue is completely traumatic for the ears. The script is full of plot holes in the size of Alaska and there are serious continuity issues. The worst part, however, is that it is not entertaining even the smallest way. And that's the most unforgivable sin in film making. But don't take my word for it. Go out and save four bucks, rent it. Just don't let me say I didn't warn you.
