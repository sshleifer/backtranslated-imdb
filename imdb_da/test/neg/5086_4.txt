** Warning - this review may include spoilers ** The idea behind Danny's character (Jet Li) is a good one - a young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like an evil pit bull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or outside the neck. <br /> <br /> But the author did not know how to deliver this idea in the context of credibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny meets a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who is to be the most confident fool a man ever was - along with his stingy, infinitely boisterous, somewhat uninteresting, stud daughter, Victoria ). By the way, I was stunned when I learned that Victoria should be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 for me. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, there is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny turns up again, hurt what Sam does, but takes him home. Danny is out for 2 days, but does these nit-wits take him to a hospital? Nooooo. I don't know if they even called a doctor. Danny is of course not a mentally stable person, it is clearly seen from the get-go, but Sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously injured or even killed by this rather strange young man. Why Morgan Freeman Took This Outrageous Role In This Asian Movie I Can't Even Start Guessing. Certainly, Mr Freeman is not so desperate for a paycheck. Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who "owns" Danny - now you're talking about a son of a gun that's hard to kill. The car Bart is in being riddled with bullets that would have rival Bonnie and Clyde's death. We think he's dead, but no. Then we have another car accident - and once again, etc. Bart escapes unharmed. <br /> <br /> Besides that, we also have Danny fighting half a dozen hard guys at a time plus a scene where Danny has decided he won't fight anymore. I do not care how much a person does not want to fight when it is down to the lead of you or you die, I think someone would fight. As I said in the subject heading - this movie is about 40 miles out of the bounds of reality as we have come to know it. It is not just the case of suspending faith - it is completely out of it. In addition, I never understood why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a lovely lady, rather than the prostitute Bart claimed she was, was mixed up with Bart and his gang and was shot. Maybe it was my fault I was distracted right about the time the scene came - but it seemed very unlikely that she and Bart would ever cross paths. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10 - and it's generous.
