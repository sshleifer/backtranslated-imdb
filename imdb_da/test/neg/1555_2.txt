Let me first make it clear that I am a big fan of bad sci-fi, especially when it comes to giant, stupid monsters. But this is such a wonderful lamb that I don't even like it to be bad. They have apparently not shaved enough money from the budget by skimming on the props (the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized news pencil available at Spencer's Gifts for about fifteen dollars), they also decided not to resort to concept or plot. The monster looks okay, in my opinion, but it does not have enough interaction with backgrounds, that is, not enough destruction to fit most fans of the genre. The general rule with gigantic monster movies is: If you don't have many fake-looking buildings to smash, then you'd better have a fake-looking monster to fight with. This movie has neither. I can't make my final complaint about the movie without giving up the end, but enough to say the origins of the monsters, and just keep the method found to get rid of it. Not even as good as most of these movies. Skip it over.
