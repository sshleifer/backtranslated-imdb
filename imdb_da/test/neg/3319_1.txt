These are definitely the worst vampire flicks of all time. I started to see this just after Interview with the vampire, and I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only did this movie script craters as large as the grand canyon, the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another, leaving the viewers thoroughly confused. The Vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible - having a good body doesn't make you an actor! The Queen's end was too light and sudden, insulting viewers' intelligence. I want to give this one star because Aaliyah actually tried his best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Apart from that, I would advise Anne Rice to take ax and start hacking those who ruined her brilliant story.
