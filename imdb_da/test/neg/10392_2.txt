This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen for a very long time. One of my friends took it out of the shelf at the video rental store and forced me to see it, an act that we both regret. Ehh ... Where to start? The printer, the actor, the quality? All that sucked. <br /> <br /> Probably some of the worst writings ever appear in a movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialogue, like "how are you?" ... "not so big, doc" (directly after an attempt at the exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempt at suicide. Of course he is not that big.) Was on some points, kind of fun. If not horribly written, planned and obvious. The general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was as if the authors could make something better to do so write a bunch of madness dialogue and throw as many sex and nudity scenes as they could randomly. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed and peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked like a cheap porn than a feature film. Oh yes, and they never actually got the act done. <br /> <br /> The actor? Terrible. x100. I think the only good actor was the short Spanish guy who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written terribly. The worst deal? Probably Paul Kappellas, whose plays combined with shitty music, a gun and a half naked blue-white girl running around in the forest, made the film almost unbearable to sit through. He even screwed his own death scene, one that should have been easy to sew. Although most others' behavior was also horrible. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters was also added to the movie's overall sugar level. There were just enough signs, so almost half of the characters died, the same amount of people were occupied at one time, and the remaining characters could not be counted on one side. Like ... 50 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What about the climax of exorcism film that happens in a stable, yet?
