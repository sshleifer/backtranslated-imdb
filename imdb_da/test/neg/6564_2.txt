No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art, but the fans expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a confused, incredible plot that just left me stifling - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the known characters interact in another movie cannot save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is not worth renting and it is hardly worth looking at, but for the true fan to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way You can see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.
