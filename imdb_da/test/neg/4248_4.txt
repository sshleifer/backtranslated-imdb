Although my preference is usually not for romantic dramas, so this movie left me a little short. <br /> <br /> It had promises, signs and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they did, but the story didn't seem to understand the direction it wanted to take. <br /> <br /> Comparisons and parallels in history, especially the three generations of women in the family, had many opportunities, but somehow they did not fully expand. It could have made the movie much easier to relate to and attach to what purpose there are films about lost love and life regained. <br /> <br /> IMHO, I think the movie has a little lack of direction in Scripture, though Harry Connick Jr. and Sandra Bullock desperately tried to breathe a little life into otherwise flat character sketches. It's not that this is a bad movie, some parts leave you to understand the reasons for different plot developments, it's just that this movie is underdone and a small flat overall.
