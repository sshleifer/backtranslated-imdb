No, it's just a cheap 1940s series of Cap's good names. If you are a fan of the comic, you will be very disappointed. They have radically changed the character. Nothing wrong, no Bucky, no one is fighting the Nazis, no wings on the side of his mask, and most importantly: Captain America is now a district attorney and no longer a GI. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Don't look too close when he switches to his costume. It is quite obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial (can you say rude?). It is also very clear that a stunt man performs most of the action here. Almost every chapter has a mandatory fist fight that is shot and executed in exactly the same way. The villain is rather bland, and although he uses an alias (The Scarab), he does not carry any kind of disguise. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effects are ridiculous and the action is average. On the plus side, we have sexy Lorna Gray as D.A.'s assistant, and the good captain will ride on a cool motorcycle in an early chapter. Overall OK but nothing special.
