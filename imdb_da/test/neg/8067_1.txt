... ever! (I always wanted to write it :) Many years ago (in 1993 as I remember it), one of my former classmates persuaded me to see what he called "an epic masterpiece". So far, it is the worst movie I've ever seen. The action, the story, the effects - everything is bad. Unless you are one of those people who just love to waste, you should forward it. But the chances are that since you read this, you've already seen it. <br /> <br /> Of almost 500 movies, this is the only non-short I have given 1/10. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any other low budget Asian warriors, so I'm guessing even worse things out there! Scary ... <br /> <br />: P
