What's wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird continues to make films that have men acting as women and women acting as men. The idiotic male instructor and author of this movie needs to have their heads examined. The main problems with this movie are its obvious feminist portraits of the sexes. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of the screen Eva Mendez and her friend swing from the beer bottles as if you might find seamen on an oil tanker doing it at a bar in Iceland. Mendez constantly kisses any girl she looks for. She also dresses provocatively in every scene, but curses as a guy. She becomes very emotional as she struggles with Will Smith for a while while trying to "defend" all women from evil people everywhere. The men are no better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do everything they can to win a date. The males in this movie are concerned with either sexual favors or unable to speak clearly when faced with a woman. Men in real life do not behave like this. <br /> <br /> What we see in this movie is a cultural product gone wrong. Everything is flip-flopped. Boys work like girls, girls seem like guys. All this is done, while the extreme pre-sections of the gender aspect are very much a part of history. Men appear to be soft and stupid, but only interested in sex most of the time, while women appear as macho and indulgent, but only as a veneer for their emotional uncertainties. <br /> <br /> This movie would be good if it wasn't presented uncomfortably to the audience. The content is not the culprit. That is the way the content is presented.
