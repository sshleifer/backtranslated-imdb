I completely forgot that I had seen this within a few days, which is quite obvious in itself. The seventh edition of Gaston 'Phantom of the Opera' Leroux's locked door country mystery, I had heard it was an engaging and witty update. So it appeared from the equal title sequence and a couple of nice details in the opening scene, but the film was very quickly stopped and became vaguely dull and completely unsatisfactory. As a mystery, the biggest problem is that it is fundamentally insoluble by the audience: As the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on a sign that appears in the final act of a wealth of background information that we have not been allowed to. As a film, be it a comedy or a thriller, the crucial problem is that characterization is almost non-existent. With the exception of the killer, all are a facial version of the typical suspects in the typical housewife story - reporter, endangered heirs, suspicious fianc√©, scatterbrained scientist father (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. There is no depth and a bit of interest and they often Exaggerated or misjudged notions do not help. You honestly don't care about anyone in it, so there's no danger or excitement. Only Claude Rich and in the last roll get Pierre Arditi something to work with, and only in the last reel will the film be close to a sense of resonance that is too elusive to be really effective. <br /> <br /> Besides, we get endless exhibits and a couple of ineffective, wild comic pieces (a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather's clock is just too poorly thought out to pay off), with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving the Explains the last third of the image. I'm not thrilled with the country-house movie or the Agatha Christie style whodunits, so they might be cit that much more lax but I found it a bad show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed, "It's all a bit of a disappointment."
