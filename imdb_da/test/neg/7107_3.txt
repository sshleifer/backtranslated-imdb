The movie is very fast moving, bizarre and colorful, like Mad Max on speed whit tons of dyes and make-up. Also very cartoonish as it said; cartoon sequence shows up here and there. The reason is also very sour, but I think it's supposed to be. What really makes me crazy in this movie is the characters, they are painfully annoying, especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty, she's really annoying (I think she's the most annoying creature I've ever seen). The editing is also annoying, much MTV stylized. Another thing missing from Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. The humor is also not much fun. However, it has some good visuals. <br /> <br /> But many people love this movie, most are women, and it is no wonder this movie is about the power of the girls .. Tank Girl this is a real chick flick and the best example a hate / love movie.
