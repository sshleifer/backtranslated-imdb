When I looked at the stamp that some people had given this movie a score of 10, they assumed that they did not know that the score was out of 100. This is a disaster movie in the true sense of this term. Badly written and weakly directed at so-called actors who could not act but could be gripped when they were ordered. In the first 60 minutes, the story looks to go in one direction, changing that thank you and getting involved in a power struggle, with extremely bad special effects. Could not elaborate an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to cheat the villain with superpowers, the "author". It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story line, because it was easier than preparing an acceptable breakdown. Not that the writing would even know the word "denouement". Some movies go directly to DVD. This should have gone directly to the trash can.
