First, let me begin with the obvious: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing millions of Jews. That said, the problem with this movie is that it sees the United States - probably the most inviting society ever to Jews outside Israel - as a very different place from Nazi Germany. Seen in 1943, the movie is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after using glasses! There are a number of very nasty things behind him (he loses his job and he cannot find a new one, his neighbors scolding him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self-pity, patronizing novels, the kind that gave liberalism a bad name.
