This is the story of a news researcher who hates his job - proving why actors - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not! <br /> <br /> I have to say it - the better moments show some foundation for being really fun (not just wacky), to continue trying, maybe take some classes and spend the time continuing Learn how to make a good movie. ("Dude, where's my car" and the "scary movie" sequence has it all over this ... college trial.) <br /> <br /> The lighting was not; Production was not; and the script had moments (conversation from space - very nice experiment without conviction). (This reminded me of "Dark Star" - which is about being "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.) The talent was the bartender (he said "dog" so annoying that I knew he had to act ... wasn't he? Now, it's acting!) Mark Hammond the guy and Marty. I guess I gave the movie a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .angelfire.com / ny5 / jbc33 /
