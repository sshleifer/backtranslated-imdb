The plot in Petites Coupures surely left this viewer dumbfounded. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** <br /> <br /> Within 48 hours, Auteuil's character has had an affair with a teenager, losing his wife's love, trying to seduce Scott Thomas, being rejected by her continues to capture another female character behind a car and then finally shot for his problems. <br /> <br /> *** end of spoiler *** <br /> <br /> what ??? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this flick is Kristin Scott Thomas. Like Charlotte Rampling, she seems to be a * natural * star in French cinema. I hope someday, Fran√ßois Ozon can throw her in a part where she can show her true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some fine French films like the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert, begging for a DVD release, yet this is the tripe that will be chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. <br /> <br /> Zzzz ..
