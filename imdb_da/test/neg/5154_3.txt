My mother took me to this movie on the driveway when I was about seven years old, which is thirty years ago. She had no idea that a family movie would be so fierce. My clearest memory was of the boy's father's face with pain when he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. This picture haunted me for weeks. I had learned that I lived in a world where a person could stab my father at any time. How could I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You must realize that this stabbing is not a fantasy for a seven year old. It is just as true as witnessing a concrete event and has no place in a child's innocent mind. It is boring that we still do not understand the impact of bringing violence into our children's lives both on our children and in our society. If only parents would protect their children from images of violence of equal strength, they protect them from images of nudity and sex.
