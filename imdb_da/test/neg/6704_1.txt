First of all, I am a gay man, although I do not live my life within the so-called "community" and it is because of movies like this that Gay-themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them is bad. As this. f I could give this a zero I wanted. (I do not understand all the positive comments unless they were all made by people who made this movie) In fact, I stopped this in a 24-minute field when the so-called "Anthony" kissed Adam outside the restaurant for no reason whatsoever. And how does his son steal from dinner if he doesn't even live in the city? Thread transfers? The action was HORRENDOUS! Sound editing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they sit on the fence and eat their lunch. Whenever the camera switches between the two so-called actors, the sound changes as if there was no filter on the microphone) Seriously do not rent or God forbid, buy this movie.Horrible Horrible Horrible act and just a stupid story.
