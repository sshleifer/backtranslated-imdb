Ocean's 12 starts at annoying and gets worse from there. As a celebrity prize presentation, each major actor / actress is introduced in short 60 scenarios that seem to stop just short with a flashing "applause now" sign. The first 60 minutes of the movie are incredibly diverse, poorly edited and sometimes completely independent of the story and confusing. Talking about the story, there is one, quite ... but it's hardly visible to anyone "look at me" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon actually seemed to "act" under this movie ... the rest of the cast only seemed to be there to attend a steering wheel-to-be session. With regard to the hoist, the action, the drama .... it was put in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and was pathetic and anti-clematic. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!
