The New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television that almost destroys David Nivens marriage with Mitzi Gaynor. Bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom (and nothing sexy happens anyway). Gaynor as an actress has about the same range as an oven - she turns on, she turns off. The film's only compensation is a supporting performance of perky Patty Duke, the pre-"Miracle Worker", as the Level's daughter. She is lovely; "Happy Anniversary" is not. * from ****
