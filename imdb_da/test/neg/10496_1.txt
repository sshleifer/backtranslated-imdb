I saw this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent, otherwise there is no way I would have seen it all the way through. The first scene in which a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seem to be electrocuted by various slowly moving weapons worn by an even slower moving Van Helsing wannabe ... in black and white ... with a voice over sets the pace for the whole rest of the movie. The battle scenes look ridiculous, the dialouder would be fun if the play wasn't so bad, what passes for the plot doesn't make sense, and the production values ​​bite (from the pleather beats Spike's coat worn by the hero to cheesy cheap magician's robe, their lead vamp swooshes round). I've seen some bad movies (check out The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone or Ravn with a very young Jack N.), but this one gets my vote for the worst of all times.
