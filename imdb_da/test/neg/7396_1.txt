The movie becomes TV as I write. I simply forgot how horrible an experience I had seen in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the movie is flawless. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans stranded in the desert forgets all the concept of morality and civilization within a few days, is ridiculous. The avarice's insanity was going on longer. <br /> <br /> Details that irritate are plenty. One is the single African godlike character that mysteriously survives the terrible climate and has done so for years without losing its mind, nor does it seem to have supply problems. Ridiculous. Thus, the rescue guide of the tour guide, an Indiana Jones look alike, whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death is a 5 minute walk from the cottage. Then there is the choice of Lear imposed on the group by a guru-like joke of an artist. He reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher. <br /> <br /> The worst is, however, Lear's choice. It is of course an intellectual brain-speed. How it should ever be a break is never clear to me. <br /> <br /> Positives are few and far between. It's a beautiful movie, but it's never important. <br /> <br /> High school intellectualism. Nice for the sake of strange. It is a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art films.
