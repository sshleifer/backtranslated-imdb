Okay ... she's on the boat with this guy, realizes he's out to kill her, knocks him out, and then finds the reason he's out for her, this disk that got his colleague killed. So what would a rational person do? Maybe conk him over his head again to make sure he really is out ?? Tie him up ?? Look, Sandra treasure, you have the chance to escape while the guy is out for so long. Until you know how long it takes to take you to escape, make sure he is not able to come after you. I HATE these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the movie was just a series of phrases that were completely coincidental and too incredible to remain interesting.
