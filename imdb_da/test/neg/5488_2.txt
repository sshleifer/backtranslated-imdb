The story is: A century of acting by actors, along with producers and theaters, has very complicated relationships. A resident dramatist has written a psychological drama. He wants to get a good production on stage, but cannot, unless he convinces a political reviewer to revise the production and give a positive review. If his production does not continue, the squad will put on The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships between the protagonists are explored; none of them interesting. But the inclusion of the characters with each other leads to giving the legend of the resident dramatist another shot. <br /> <br /> This movie is just an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put a movie on. The story lines are incoherent for anyone who is not a mate to one of the stars. The only reason I did not leave the theater after about half an hour is that a fat woman rested a full meal at the top of the stomach at the end of my row.
