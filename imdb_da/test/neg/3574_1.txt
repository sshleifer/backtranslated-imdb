I recently rented this movie on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice to watch as I am from both England (Bradford) and also interested in film making. However, it soon became clear that this movie seemed to lack a decent level of development script-wise. The signs were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. The subject could be an interesting basis for a movie. However, the delivery of this proved naive and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The ending felt as if it were crucial to the characters - punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary. It felt a little awkward and silly and, unlike the 'realism', it seemed to be used in shooting form. For me, the film dealt with the characters and the subject in a rather heavy hand and clumsy way. It felt as if the author had already decided how he wanted to end the story and strive to fight everything else to fit it. <br /> <br /> Another point I feel strongly about is the watery Ken Loach feel the movie had. I am quite worried that British film financiers cannot see that there is more to British movies than "gritty realism". It has become almost a safe option. Movies are an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and are not exploited by British feature film producers. There is a lot of talent here in England. It is unfortunate that most of these individuals end up making music videos and advertising 100% of the time, or they go to America. <br /> <br /> Love + hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-time television drama.
