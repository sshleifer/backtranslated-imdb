Wow, this movie was horrible. It's as simple as that. It's actually the first time I went out early, as far as I can remember. It turned out okay, though: I had a very nice conversation with two most charming girls, while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on the lap they called a "movie". <br /> <br /> Where to start. Bad plays, bad jokes. Faecal humor, which I simply cannot stand. Sorry, but snot, piss and scat are * not * fun. Have you seen the title picture? In fact, that scene draws for approx. 5 minutes, where the two "heroes" frames and mutilate each other, which must be humorous all in itself. It is not. <br /> <br /> Apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, I can't remember much about this. At least not very good. I was really really disappointed with this piece of waste. Or let's be honest here: since I'm actually a big fan of "British" (ie black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So do I want my advice? Three words: don't look.
