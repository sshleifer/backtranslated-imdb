Amando DeOssorio was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started well but had some really ridiculous moments, such as the shot of a small model boat in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent" he hits the rock bottom and takes some notable actors with him and tells the story of a silly sock monster that brings Google Eyed Terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening sequence sets the scene and demonstrates an interrupted military mission, where for some unknown reason, American pilots release a brazenly cartooned in the film somewhere in the sea off Spain's coast. The military commander gives this order from an office that has a prominent US flag and a portrait of a shaken look Ronald Reagan, one of only a few things that make this movie really look like in the eighties. The other two are the hilarious subtitles that declare the year to be "1,985" and Tyria Power's dated Sheena Easton hairdresser who would have looked really cool for some ripped neon sweat. <br /> <br /> One of the coolest monsters you'll ever see rising from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the errant nuclear bomb has killed much of the local fish. Unfortunately, for our throw, it has no effect on the garden hose, which quickly comes down to Spain's coast to some miniature-seen chaos. <br /> <br /> Now that I say the monster is unrealistic, I'm not exaggerating. It's not just "kind of" false look. I'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars they seem to have been awarded, but most of it looks like it was made of Crayola markers, a ping pong ball and an old sock. Not only that, it has this monstrous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that resembles as much as the "Jaws" theme, that it is a marvel, no one was sued. <br /> <br /> Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland are getting dormant and the dialogue couldn't have been more gloomy. Through a series of plot contrivances, our leading players are thrown together in a quest for ... I'm not sure what the purpose is. The bottom line must prove that the worm is genuine to save their mouth (he is blamed for a snake-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after an observation). None of this matters, because at the end of the movie nothing has been solved. No one admits that the worm is genuine and it is not even dead. In addition, Power and Bottoms are still on the lamb from the law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it seems, no one but our heroes know that the snake exists (despite many disappearances, a garbage lighthouse and a broken railway bridge) and they embark on an expanded non-adventure for to track down and chase the monster away ... do not kill it as they know they do not match it. Your big plan is to use flares to scare it. Although their scheme is bleached, the hose causes a huge explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea hose is so scared that it swims away. The critical viewer wondered why the worm was not afraid of earlier in the movie, as it caused a couple of major explosions after crashing into a dock. But don't take it away. It swims away, and our heroes are sure it is gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror the stars felt when they saw the finished movie they just worked on. A Lamebrain script and a pair of dim response images could never have prepared them for embarrassment to share screen time with an indented jumper / stop motion beastie. At least, the supporting characters must have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant snake head. I'm not sure what was going on when making this movie; The monster is inexpensive, but there are some well-crafted miniature sets, so someone spent some time doing them, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved. It is apparently the game even though perhaps this movie sense of humor went over my head. In the end, the film is nothing but an easy target for a drunk comment. Watch it at a party for the best results.
