Cast and crew in this cheap horror pot boiler is more interesting than anything that happens in the movie itself; We have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, filmmaker Charles Van Enger, editor-in-chief Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The fake Payton gets her head on almost every man she gets in touch with deep in the African jungle, where she lives on man Cavanaugh's plantation: Doctor Conway secretly praises her, while the narrow foreman Burr's approach is quite literally more handy. On the other hand, Chaney (surprisingly) is the backward but familiar authoritarian figure and Strode is a native police officer. The reason is very simple, but frankly it doesn't make much sense: After a particularly excited dinner complete with thunderstorms, Burr and Cavanaugh (art imitates life more on it later) to blow in the garden over their love for Payton and, conveniently for Burr, a big snake happens to crawl nearby, where Cavanaugh hits the ground! Witnessing the event behind the bushes, Payton's enigmatic girl (a native witch no less) pays for an inexplicable reason a curse on Burr (who in the meantime has married Payton), who regularly makes him a gorilla ... from his lot wedding day (when his hand short gets hirsute)! So why does Burr lose weight in the jungle for several days? even though the monkey creature hardly gleams throughout the film. It must be said, however, that the version I watched ran for just 56 minutes when the 'official' length is elsewhere given as either 66, 70 or 76 !! Therefore, the film understandably feels rushed and uneven if it is never less than leisurely enjoyable as it culminates in the gorilla's oppressive hunt of Payton in the jungle, where the former are themselves pursued by the pistol ship Chaney and Conway. To get back to the movie's tragic blonde leading lady in a moment: after a promising start in movies next to such Hollywood legends as James Cagney and Gary Cooper ?? in KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950) ?? Her career was soon narrowed to B (and smaller) class territory thanks to her own 'colorful' offscreen antics: her most notorious misdemeanor was the cause of a much-publicized bar-jumble between suave husband Franchot Tone and brutish former lover Tom Neal who ended up with the former in coma and Payton actually left him for the latter shortly thereafter !! But it wasn't all: Nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was among her conquests (a controversial issue at that time); short-lived man Tone, who has caught Payton's infidelity on camera, spread the amazing photographic evidence around Hollywood, and this earned almost all his days as a starlet ?? Her last movie appearance is Edgar G. Ulmer MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955), which I happen to have in my "Unexpected movie" pile. The last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on Skid Row in explosives, drugs, prostitution, strokes, arrests and even a stabbing ?? until late 1967 in her parents' home at age 39!
