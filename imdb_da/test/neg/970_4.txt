Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that results in a fantastic comedy. Great expectationa often leads to dissapointment and it turns out to be the case. When Eddy, as a police officer, destroys a drug trafficking by Detective Robert, they do so much to end up doing a live action reality television show. Logic is not a big part of this movie. The super gun, which they use the other half of the film, hunts down confirms it. A twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in one minute (without reloading) is just as imaginative as science fiction. A five-pound gun that fires hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil is certainly the future weapon using the past technology. Obviously, this movie is designed for neither adults nor children, so if you are somewhere, this is the movie for you.
