Wow, this is anti-Christian bias big time! This is based on a novel by Stephen King, and he wrote this kind of bias before and then Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this movie we see a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest, both acting as fools and becoming profane at the same time. Of course, the devil has taken over the city, so perhaps his influence is in these guys, but they are typical Hollywood portraits. They never show a minister talking and acting like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest. And - another "given" - they make satan character the most interesting of the movie. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the devil and makes him a sweet guy. Ironically, Von Sydow has played a number of these roles after reproducing Jesus in the 1964 movie "The Greatest Story Ever Customs." You wonder why the actors are so turned up? They do not know if they are God, Satan or anyone in between. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who played a lot of excruciating roles until the last couple of years, is appropriately thrown into this story. He and the rest of the medieval characters in this movie don't make it fun to see. <br /> <br /> From what I've heard, the King's book is even darker and more sick than this hated movie but better constructed. Frankly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
