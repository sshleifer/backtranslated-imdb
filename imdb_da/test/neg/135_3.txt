The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it should be one of Truffaut's best movies. I loved the plot where a penis marry a man from halfway around the world - the sight invisible. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen-girl so she could take her place! She then cleaned her huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and wanted to see more ... <br /> <br /> And then the movie fell apart and was simply stupid! Despite her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific Ocean) and he from Reunion (an Indian Ocean island) when taking a trip to the South of France, he almost stumbled upon her. Hmm, .... odds are 187,000,000 to 1, but he finds her. So instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her - even when she recognizes what she has done. Okay - it's hard to believe, but okay ... but then he helps hide her from a private detective by killing him !!!! No one is so stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is pretty pretty, but come on people - it's just stupid. And if he only wanted her as a sex object, why should he make it a woman who is often full and completely selfish and evil. This movie is due to the very ridiculous plot does not deserve such high ratings! Unless you're a die-hard Truffaut fan, try another movie - even a Truffaut's - just NOT this one.
