Aliens lose a giant monster called Zarkorr, then send a hologram that sees your average stupid teenage girl telling the postman Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh in the only movie you ever see him) that has been chosen to fight. Also, if he loses the plant, it goes stupid, then he goes out to fight Zarkorr Invader! This movie is bad, very bad. So bad, you need negative numbers just to give it a rattan. Wrongly written, poor conducting, far below the Power Rangers over-the-top wood spectacle that you just whiting for a horde of Lumberjacks to get out of no where and cut them down! And let me not get started on the theme song at the end. The people who made this stamped pallet of S $ @ # shouldn't be loud near a camera or something to do with movies. Zarkorr is a cold-looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one. Do yourself a favor and not see this movie, it's 80 or so minute of life. The actors who are in this have never worked again immediately. <br /> <br /> 3/10
