Honestly, I have to admit that I go and see certain silly movies based on the hype they have generated or are currently generating. This stupid Salman Khan & Govinda feature is one of those stupid movies. Okay, now we've all seen 'Hitch' with Will Smith as a date doctor trying to help out that odd people find true. So why should we see Salman Khan re-enact this? Here is the question of $ 64,000. In case you are wondering, Govinda plays the odds ball in search of his life's love (an unattainable socialite) played by Katrina Kaif. <br /> <br /> Lara Dutta is playing with Sallu's Eva Mendes and Sallu's Real Life Love Kaif playing pretty much her character as any role you have seen her so far, no stretch, no action needed. And for almost three and a half hours, we are tortured with spoofs from other Bollywood movies and characters or better, but we are treated with low performances by previous hit films. Rajpal Yadav co-stars. F
