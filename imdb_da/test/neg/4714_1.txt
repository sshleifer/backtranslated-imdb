Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so wildly filmed, the focus isn't even on this supposed "real half-cast", it's more on the crew coming from Hollywood to make the movie. No cinematic meaning at all, and if I could take back the nearly 1 1/2 hours I used to watch this movie, I would feel much better. <br /> <br /> Initially, giving you the impression will be filmed somewhat generically, as an actual Hollywood production. But then they go into the story of the story and it's filmed so it's terrible. It really has to be a "Blair Witch Project" tag as they mostly use what you think is "real camera shooting", it's not, don't be fooled. Worst movie I've ever seen. . . on the positive side, it has a half-frightening scene in it, and the half-shots pictures were not so bad to look at. DO NOT RENT
