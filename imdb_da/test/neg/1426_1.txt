Just seen Which way to the front? at TCM (UK) it is a really horrible movie. If I had paid for the pictures, I would have gone out. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess on a movie. Byers (Lewis) and his companions span cast uniforms from an Italian 1960's scifi movie. Was the CND / Peace symbol badges on the uniforms supposed to be ionic? The sets were clean in 1970, I'm sure a Hollywood TV back lot could have given a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The movie is furious with racism. The movie takes mickey out of veterans. <br /> <br /> Not funny how Lewis each make another movie is beyond me.
