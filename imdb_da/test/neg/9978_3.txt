I rated this movie a 3 and it was generous. The landscape is mouth-watering and flashy, it is mostly awful. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job of performing (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the film's last movie. John Gielgud, any time short of his appearance in the movie, still seemed to play a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornographic parts were neither erotic nor did they much to promote history. Okay, Malcolm McDowell had a nice ass and the guy who played Macro was nice. The guy who played Claudius looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was quite contrary to Robert Graves' picture of Claudius. The climatic (?) Murder of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate because it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area when he was actually murdered in the underground passage on the palatine hill running along the front of Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this movie where almost everything drew my attention away from it - merciful distractions. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus if you want pornography and sadism, see Passolini's "Salo," but remained completely away from this movie.
