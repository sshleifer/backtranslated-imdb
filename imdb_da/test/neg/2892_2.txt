This movie is honestly one of the best movies all the time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It is a reliable way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the film slowly evolves, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any plot that the film can actually contain. This effect is probably created because of the lack of sweet action / sweet babes. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr Eisenstein was not able to master the assembly art either. An excellent example of this is the stage of the Odessa steps. No apparent cause, an event that would actually have taken a matter of seconds, has been transformed into a seven-minute nightmare for any sane seer. This editing error eliminates any kind of realism throughout the movie. Honestly, I've seen more realistic editing to see cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some individuals who have commented on this title have greeted the Battleship Potemkin as: "One of the greatest movies of all time" and "Really a masterpiece". Now I write this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Certainly what to say was: "One of the biggest snooze party sites" and "Really an epic bug". In conclusion, do not waste your time. If you are interested in watching a much better quality movie, go to www.youtube.com and see a Halo 3 montage. If I played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a game of slayer on guard, I would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then bag his dead body. PEACE!
