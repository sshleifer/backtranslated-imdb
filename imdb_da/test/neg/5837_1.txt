I like science-fiction movies and even low-rated, made for TV, negotiating box, movies I can still find interesting. Well, I found this in a trading box and brought it as a choice for a movie night with a group of friends. I was literally * emabrrassed * as I brought this movie. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning, the play is bad, the story is bland, and the plot is almost non-existent. All this leads to what the film really was: A graphic film with soft core film. <br /> <br /> The movie started with a women's prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in a kind of mine. First of all, this movie is not serious: attractive women in a prison are forced to do physical work. Yeah right! No matter what. : P When the "plot" continued, it was overshadowed by meaningless scenes that people had sex. Halfway through the movie my friends and I stopped to see it was so stupid. The next day I thought I'd give the movie another chance and see the rest. I looked about 15 minutes and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent, science-fiction or even a sci-fi monster movie, DO NOT see Lethal Target! If you want to see a low-budget, soft-core, easy-to-plot, then see Lethal Target.
