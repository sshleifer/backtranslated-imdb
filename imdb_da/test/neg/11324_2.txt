Wow, I swear it never happened to me before. I have only seen "Golden Temple Amazon" yesterday, and I have no remembrance of anything that happened in this movie. It's so brilliant this movie is, I guess! Now I just remember being enticed to see it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art showing a dry drawing of a mighty Amazon who prepares her bow to fire in an unspecified goal. I am often fooled by appealing DVD covers ?? especially jess franco them ?? And I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. Oh good ?? After reading the other user comments, some parts of my memory came back, although I still suspect to confuse this movie with another jes Franco masterpiece I saw the day before, namely "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" (and yes, the one had a great DVD cover too). "Golden Temple Amazon" opens with a bag of warm white African amazons ?? I'm aware of the contradiction but don't blame me ?? slaughtered the parents of a fragile young girl because they violated the grass for the purpose of stealing the golden treasures of the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. She is accompanied by a bunch of seedy adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge, but did not want any gold home. The rudimentary premise is, of course, secondary to all the showcase of adorable female nudity and free sliding. Analía Ivars, Eva Léon and the other nameless Amazons are all common Franco choices and would like to walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. You like to look at all these perfect female baskets, as the rest of the "Golden Temple Amazon" is a dull and incompetent mess. There is hardly any violence or action, and no less than half of the film is pure filler, pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited in history and such things. The amazing DVD cover will definitely be a good addition to your collection, but opening the box is completely meaningless.
