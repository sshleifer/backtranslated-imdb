I have mistakenly believed that this neo-noir effort from the Buffalo - Niagara Falls area may be somewhat different. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There are many issues with "The Falls" that really have nothing to do with low budget video production. Immediately one has to question why all the constant story? My feeling is that if you have a proper script, the audience will keep up without being offended by voice over storytelling. The action is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but merely adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is annoyingly shot like an MTV music video, which I found totally unacceptable. The story, bad plays and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided. - NOTE
