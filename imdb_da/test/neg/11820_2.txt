Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of B movie, where the genre's limitations actually act as a kind of liberating influence on the authors and directors ?? Such classic recording films as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat" originate from this environment. Unfortunately, his former confederates run on American International Pictures out of steam in the 1970s, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often produced second-rate imitations of Corman's film, sometimes with his self-made stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those films. It is basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House with some of the same stars doing many of the same things. Yes, this is a John Ashley co-production (yes, the same John Ashley who was the salutary Elvis who would be in "How to make a monster" and paired with Debbie Walley in "Beach Blanket Bingo") with all the signature marks of his productions women's prisons where all but maybe 2 or 3 protagonists, including the inmates and guards, are Filipino actors in mostly non-speaking roles, where we see supermodel-type women taking the role of revolutionary militants and where the film's primary joy is derived from rudimentary S&M exploitation. <br /> <br /> The print I saw recently was terribly easily damaged (good ole Will Viharo described it as "Yellow Mama, Yellow Mama"), but I believe that even under the best conditions, photography and management are extremely routine, and there is also very little visual value here ? Corman must not have had much to do with the movie itself, because he was always pushy to at least give his films an extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the movie look more impressive. This movie does not look impressive, it does not have an impressive soundtrack, and you just feel embarrassed by anyone showing a sharp talent. The only extremely interesting performances come from Pam Grier as a celebratory whore to escape life, Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as her grotesque self-indulgent pimp and Sid Haig as a cowboy-styled mercenary. The story places Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low-budget female version of "The Defiant Ones", but does little with the melodramatic possibilities that this premise provides. It's basically just an excuse to make sure that the two main characters can still stop for a good mud breach while trying to escape the prison together. This is all in good fun, but the film eventually fails as exploitation because there is a certain edge and rawness that should be present in such scenes, which are replaced instead under this instructor's hand with some kind of yawning predictability. <Br /> <br /> So the movie will have little value for fans of hard-core utilization ?? At least in the version I saw, it's no more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" from over a decade earlier and far less interesting visually and thematically. For those who just enjoy laughing at "so bad is the good" movie, this can provide something fun, but it's not at the top level. People will be more advisable to find out "Caged Heat" or some of the others who enjoy in their own brutality to the point of becoming camp; this looks more like less ambitious bets like Cirio Santiago's "The Muthers". Unfortunately, the best thing about this movie is the title and presence of Pam Grier, which was better in other movies around the same time (especially Jack Hills "Coffy"). This movie may illustrate a mid-point in Miss Grier's journey from Corman's B-movie Queen-For-A-Day secretary, but apart from its historical "meaning" as such, it will have little value even to Grier's big fans because she's given much a little to work with here. Worth skipping unless of course you can see it in a movie theater with many friends and a lot of beer I did. And even then its value is questionable.
