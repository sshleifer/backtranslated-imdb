After reading this story a while ago, I was very excited to watch the movie. I read the book again. It's one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. What I think what makes history is the relationship. It was the bottom point for me in the movie, because I think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. I have no idea what is supposed to change the main character roles (Tim's and Alan's characters). The movie did not capture John and Savannah's relationship at all. Maybe if you haven't read the book, you like this movie, but I thought it was so boring with the book. I thought Channing was a good choice for John, but I had the feeling that he should bring out all the young adults to see it, so I think it was more geared towards them. The end cut out the whole point of the book, so I was also dissatisfied with it. I hoped the movie was more like the laptop or a trip to remember and the way they caught the books. I feel like I wasted a Friday night and 10 bucks on a juicy love story, not at all the story I was expecting to see.
