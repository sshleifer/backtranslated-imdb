Kristy Swanson plays an elite hitwoman who should have beaten a TV rep for a group of bad guys. But when she sees this poor guy at home with her children, she decides to scare the whole project and the TV reporter's life is spared. Hitwoman's life breaks when the people who wanted this reporter to kill now want her death not to keep up with her task. It is also the basis of a movie called Supreme Sanction. <br /> <br /> Supreme waste of time is more like it. We see Swanson's character look up, grumble and kill men much larger than her. And she's always a fifty step ahead of the group of murders that for some reason can't do away with this super hitwoman. Having a woman away and beating all those men, making the movie seem so gay. It's too predictable when you expect Swanson's character to win anyway, which makes the movie boring and unlucky. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson is a decent actress who in her younger days was always sexy and easy on th e eyes.Supreme Sanction is not one of her better efforts.
