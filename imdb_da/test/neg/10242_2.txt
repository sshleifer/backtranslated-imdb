The oddity of Galaxina is not that it is extremely bad, even if it is. The odd thing is that, despite being extremely bad, it's not fun. Extremely bad movies have their own special brand of accidental humor - the secret to their success, you can say. But Galaxina is completely different - it is MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie where the intended * and * accidental humor both falls. <br /> <br /> It is easy to find out why the intentional jokes fail - and the reasons are quite varied. Sometimes it is a timing question; sometimes it is a good idea that is poorly prepared (the human restaurant * could have been fun but it was not); sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room where the piston ended up on the floor; And sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies get their laugh from such unintentional snafus. It is harder to find out why Galaxia doesn't have a laugh at counting. Something is strangely wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, as something is wrong (not at all subtle) with the intentional humor. It is a very bad movie, whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is. It is completely unique in my experience.
