Amanda Bynes is a tremendously talented actress and I have really enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the amazing "She's the Man." For that reason alone, "Sydney White" was a huge disappointment to me. The real reason for my aversion to this movie is the bad use of characters. In a good fun teenage comedy, it's quite okay to have a cast of all pretty reality-based teenagers. In "Sydney White" this idea is thrown out of the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes a great Sydney, but she really lacks much of what usually makes her glow as an actress. I blame this on the script, making her character too gentle and detained, and on the hair / makeup department, giving her a disgusting plastic and an annoying hair style. The seven "dorks" that Sydney eventually turns to are far worse. They are so heavy that it is impossible to like them or even respect them as signs. They are essentially repellent gag food. Just like the story is "Prince Charming", which is incredible as a character and is as cheesy as possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie's biggest star is (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is actually very good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn. It's just a shame that the screenwriters didn't make her a little grayer than black. <br /> <br /> The reason is pretty much the "Snow White." What kills it is that it is too silly and obvious a re-imagination. The connections to "Snow White" are thrown so much in us throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overwhelmed. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is far too despicable, the seven "dorks" are too dunky, and Sydney is just too pure of heart. Now it should not say that the film is bad. Although Bynes is forced down by the script, she still has her moments. Like Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to the maximum in her scenes. Sydney's chambermate, "Dinky", is also fun as a character. It's a fun movie on parts that are just too cheesy and clich√©d to recommend.
