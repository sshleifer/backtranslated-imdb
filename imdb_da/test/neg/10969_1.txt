I have no idea how exactly Flynn's depiction is seen in this movie, but even as a work of fiction, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The scripture is everywhere and you go wondering how he came from one scene to the next - you just get the least information needed to keep continuity and understand his current situation and it's hard to understand Flyn's and other people's motives behind some of their behavior. Add a number of stupid and incredible situations, and you have movies that come across as one of your dreams that seem to make sense while you sleep, but when you wake up and you try to remember it, it's just odd , uneven and completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There are many long, boring musical parts of the movie that for me are either bad direction or a bad instructor trying and failing to be artistic. /> <br /> None of the characters are as sympathetic, and the Flynn character comes across as a self-serving liar, chew, thief, robber, killer, bear fighter, gigolo, and cheater who will do anything and step on To promote his own dreams, and somehow despite great opportunities, it just seems to miraculously fall into his lap. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entertaining or satisfying in any way and by any account, not even historically accurate, so why see it for yourself? To rub salt in the wound, the DVD had one of the worst transmissions I've ever seen, it wasn't even in wide screen or Dolby 5.1, it had horrible telecine wobble and many many items from what looked like a movie reel that had assembled dust and scratches somewhere.
