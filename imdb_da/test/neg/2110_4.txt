So I was energized during my snakes on a flight weekend, after the movie we wanted a little more. Why don't you snake on a train? How bad it can be, its snakes probably kill people on trains. The hoses should be rattles. First of all, me and my friends thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy rattling sound clips. We actually put all the things ready to turn it off (we are too lazy to go over and knock out). Next thing we knew, we do not know what darkening was going on, but something incredibly fun happens at the end. It is one of those ends that you will rewind a few times just to squeeze out the laughs because you suffered so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 mins an "8", the rest of the movie a 2.
