(Caution: more spoilers) <br /> <br /> One day there will be a post-apocalyptic movie that doesn't stink. Unfortunately, POSTMAN is not the movie, although I have to give it the credit for trying. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays only one person like "Postman". In fact, he is not a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in western America, destroyed by an unspecified disaster. He deals with isolated villages by performing Shakespeare. Suddenly a pack of bandits called the Holocaust, the self-declared warlords of the West, descended on a village visited by Costner and their evil leader Gen. Bethlehem (Will Patton) prepares Costner. After much misery and many efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, ending a long section of the movie, which could have been better told in a three-minute flashback. <br /> <br /> Finally, we come to the big prerequisite: The escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail car and delivers letters to the nearest city and hopes to get some food pretext of being a postman. A number of the village's people, led by young Ford (Larenz Tate), want to address this postman act, which doesn't fit well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself the involuntary and unwilling leader of a band of postmen in war with the Holnists. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. The Holnists are dependent on their livelihoods on the fact that the villages they offer are isolated from each other; The Holnists can destroy a village, but could not resist all their victims united. To unite, the villages must communicate with each other, and a work post system would thus be a major step towards putting the Holocaust out of service. So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic post carriers. Unfortunately, any defeat of Bethlehem is not a result of the villages that unite him, but rather your old standby cliché, one to one shot between him and Costner. There is also no real attempt in the societies to use the post to work together to solve their problems; All the entry seems to be the standard "Hi, Aunt Debbie" thing played for maximum sentimental value. The POSTMAN is one of the most predictable films shot at shots I've ever seen. Now I'm not deliberately trying to destroy movies for myself by trying to find out what will happen next time. But here we are talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I just knew what was going to happen next time if I wanted to know. After a lion is prominently exhibited to eat people, a holistic bandit seeking the escaped Costner ventures into bushes for a noise, and we are so "shocked" when the lion eats him. A bunch of unofficial villagers are rounded off and shot by a lighthouse fight, and one of the villagers sings some famous last words just before they are shot, to my huge lack of surprise. A covered statue is revealed to show exactly what everyone knew would be there: Costner bent to retrieve a letter from a dull child we saw earlier in the movie. A man tells Bethlehem that no lord, you can't just take my wife; Bethlehem runs the unsuspecting mind, though he is the only one in the theater that is unsuspecting. <br /> <br /> But it's rank, cloying sentimentality that really challenges POSTMAN. Olivia Williams, who plays Costner's love Abby, is best served. She pours her heart into the material and gives her a lot of effort to make it sound natural and sincere. She tries so hard, it's heartbreaking. But no one could ever have made the lines "I have a gift for you, Postman ... You give hope as it is in your pocket" sounds like anything other than the syrupy cardboard they are. Another example is the scene where a Costner thunders mounted past a little boy, ignoring his presented letter, only to turn around, stare at him for what looks like five minutes, and then thunder back to retrieve the letter. Why hasn't Costner picked it up for the first time? No real reason; It's just a work of art that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dribbling the child's hope and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability unite at the end when the postman's statue is revealed. I sat and thought, "Please tell me to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with cutesy kid. It's probably also for saccharin, too obvious for even this movie." Then the music swelled and we actually sliced ​​back to the dreaded little boy who smiled as his letter to his virgin aunt was whisked away, and I held my head in my hands and thought, "Someone shoots me." It felt like having thirty pound apple pie hit the throat. <br /> <br /> Gen. Bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal. Your default problem post apocalyptic villain is the best possible hardest S.O.B. in the valley. Bethlehem is apparently a little of a man inside who tries to make himself feel important by turning on others. Although some threats are killed, Bethlehem is credible in a way that most villains are not. Unfortunately, Patton overrides. And even though we told it early, Bethlehem completely destroyed his last challenger for five seconds with hand-to-hand combat, Bethlehem's current fighting skills appearing at the end of the movie are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The deal is otherwise pretty good. Costner has done better, but his raid was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and trustworthy job. James Newton Howard's score is competent, although it is not the epic standards that the movie was on. But saving this movie is not enough. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of ****.
