A not so good action thriller because it mistakenly develops the same water as early Steven Seagal movies because there is not a very good set piece. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character he has played since the law. In my opinion, Keenen Ivory Wayan's practice is wasted in such an average movie and belongs to a much better movie. Bob Gunton is okay as the main tongue. The best play throughout the film belongs to Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of the killer. My favorite scenes are the battle scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the film's reasons for watching The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the short look of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox. It's too bad that there were no more scenes with her in them.
