This movie is not worth getting a downturn review, it just made me decide that I won't watch the next Tarantino movie. And I used to love Tarantino's movie. <br /> <br /> Not artistic, not entertaining, not witty, not fun, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this movie were Tarantino's first, it would also have been his last. Tarantino should address himself, otherwise his next movie will be 3 hours of meaningless, boring and uncool dialogue. It looks like he is in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> When you finish your popcorn, there's no need to sit in a theater anymore.
