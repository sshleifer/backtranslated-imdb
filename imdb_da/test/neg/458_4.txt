After the turning point for NIGHT CASE, Robert Montgomery (for most time) came into his finest movie and performances: HERE GET MEETING. EARTH, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE, THE LITTLE IN THE COUNTRY, RIDE THE RED HORSE, SAXON CHARM, JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the errors he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and manage work. In 1949 he made what would be his last film performance - he played Collier Lang, a selfish movie star drawn to help the authorities investigate a young girl's boyfriend. Apparently, my perception of this movie is a minority image. Most of the given views are favorable to it. I thought it was a dull, unclear script, with Ann Blyth's group organizer not very appealing as a sign. She admires Montgomery as a star, and this "helps" when summoned to assist the authorities, but after a while I found that there was no chemistry between them. The script was also devoid of fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing I recall about this day as a joke was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth and he is admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses up like Churchill, and we see him wearing a floppy wide brimmed hat, smoked a big cigar and painting (Holmes's bald head helps in disguise). It was the most memorable joke of this movie - not much of a real memory. Montgomery entered the early television and eventually won the attention and respect he had always earned in films. His last contact with the films was his GALLANT HOURS direction on Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, starred with his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a far better movie than this. For his overall film and television career, I will give this mediocre movie a "4". It looks to me as generous.
