I rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. We were actually laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our dubious movie taste. Unfortunately, I don't remember the first half of the movie because everything I did stood on the huge metal braces Jane wore. And I didn't hear anything either because of the incomprehensible lash. The other thing that was able to understand my attention beyond her metal mouth was her dubious fashion sense. This film was made in 2005, but it seems that the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high waist jeans, ankle socks and knee-length skirts, then this little downhill memory walk is perfect for you.
