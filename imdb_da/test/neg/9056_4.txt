Personally, I haven't really got a great deal from the ACT to look at EKS 'OWN ISSUES. I noticed a lot of highly rated reviews on here for the movie and I'm a little surprised. Maybe I missed something that other reviewers felt "moved" off, but I found the movie pretty boring and basically meaningless. <br /> <br /> The "action" of the movie is a bunch of autopsy films recorded in an "art-house" style - lots of extreme close-ups, strange editing, etc. ... and without sound or dialogue. I think the effect of seeing with one's own eyes could be considered as an examination of human anatomy, or perhaps (if you really want to dig a little) some kind of comment on human frailty or anything - but I found it personally being a bunch of semi-interesting but ultimately dull autopsy. If that is your thing, it will be a winner for you. What concerns me - I have seen more interesting ER recordings. Not a "bad" movie, as it is not really a "movie" in the traditional sense - I just found something really remarkable about it - 4/10.
