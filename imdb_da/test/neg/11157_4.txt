Throughout the "End of Days" I saw that the filmmakers might try to make this unique to the average Hollywood action movie. Of course, they failed, but you have to give them credit to try. In fact, Peter Hyams tried to control this time, instead of just throwing out another flat action movie. He tried to inject the atmosphere into the film by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used properly (see "Se7"), but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director and offers nothing more than basic shoot outs and giant scenes, except the noisy, sub par f / x end "battle". As a photographer, Hyams shows the real ability to show good frame work and movement, but it is nothing about solid work. Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the movie's greatest enemy. At parts, the script really shows a good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the Temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these little pluses are being pulled out of a negative river. Generic dialogue / signs, gapping plot holes and practical plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard Hollywood black holes Marlowes manuscript falls into. The shadow of the good movie it could have faded very quickly. The movie surprisingly has a good cast. Arnold, who still holds the bigger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on-edge battle with no more than average results. Stick to being the invincible hero Arnie, that's what you're good at. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble and brings a good cynicism to Satan's role. In a scruffy role ripening to assault, Byrne limits himself and it gives a bit more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he has done better. Also look for a starry little role from Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of Hollywood action movies. He was heading in the right direction, but had neither the script nor the originality to take it there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
