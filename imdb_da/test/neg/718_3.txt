This film was recommended to me by some academics. From their comments I had some pretty high expectations. But this movie was nothing but disappointing. The purpose of the director is obvious - to use a mix of speeches / poems as a way of arguing for the Bush doctrine. But the director fails in this regard. I also question the director's choice of main character. It is a bum that is definitely not worth hearing. The rise of the company's power, so what? Most importantly, this film is a failing score in its convincing power; It is clearly intended for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the film's aesthetics are quite satisfactory. But pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks.
