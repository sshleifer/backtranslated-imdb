I just can't imagine possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper would be in this movie after reading the script. Maybe they were extorted? Or are they so much out of money? The main problem with the movie is that it is boring. The talks between Madsens and Hopper's character are meaningless, as are the bored chats between two friends while drinking beer on a Saturday night. You never feel for any of the characters (although Madsen's psychic killer is very sympathetic, compares to the other characters). Hopper was always a good actor, and Madsen does a good job as a serial killer, otherwise the play is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes throughout the film, where something actually happens, each lasting about three minutes. Although "talking and thinking of murder and character of murderers" scenes would have been interesting if they were scenes in a book. The whole concept would have been interesting for a novel, but a movie just can't endure with a story with so much inner thinking and so little action.
