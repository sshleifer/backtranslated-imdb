To see how to destroy a movie, study it very closely. In fact, it's so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone. Pay particular attention to how most scenes appear to be turned up for about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this film at all levels. The overall impression is that someone got a below average script, wannabe actors, an average instructor, and absolutely no budget at all. With a formula like that, it should just be doomed. <br /> <br /> I rented this once, and I swear I got stupid to see it. If you are humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie and burn it - UNWATCHED - as a service to the world. It has no distinguishing plot, bad acting, and then throws in something about evil ugly women, just to really throw it all out. I would suggest seeing paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape! Seriously. The paint would be better. I wish I could give this negative 10 stars.
