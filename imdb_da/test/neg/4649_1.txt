Legendary Cameron Mitchell turkey about an actor / makeup man who is burned by a studio's head when a drink is thrown in the face as he turns on a cigarette. Reduced to a pea and wearing an eyelash Mitchell working at Movieland Wax Museum. He also kidnaps and kills people using a solution that paralyzes them so that he can turn them into screenshots. Really bizarre bad movie that can withstand description. See, as the different wax figures try not to move, see when the whole tobacco is set to several southern states, consumed? Look, as things just get breathing and breathing. It's a terrible train wreck of a movie, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad movie that will amaze yourself, as it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
