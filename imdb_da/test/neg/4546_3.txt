I am all about the walking dead, but my mind is still uncertain about the wandering, frozen dead. Unfortunately, CHILLING didn't help me do anything for me. This is really slow, as nothing happens in the first 45 minutes, which makes me press the "movie enhancement" button several times. At that time, the well-designed zombies appear too late, and the director (two are rumored to have filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all look tired / embarrassed / in any way. I want to give the movie credit as it is going on T2, ending with villains frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extended promo reel from back on the day that runs 8 minutes long, and I would actually recommend it to watch the girl in its entirety.
