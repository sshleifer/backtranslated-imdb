There are so few movies where just the title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. One such movie is I was communist for the FBI. Another example would be getting married to a monster from outer space. The really interesting thing about this movie is how in the name of heaven was it nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category? It is not a documentary in any kind of word, it is not even in the hybrid category of docudrama. It's just a rather widespread film about the work of an FBI undercover agent named Matt Cvetic, who infiltrated the Communist Party of Pittsburgh and became active in trying to take over the Steelworkers Union for the Communists and report on the said activities to his handlers in FBI. <br /> <br /> A documentary for that work could have been interesting, but what we got was a movie that suits the paranoid times. I found it fascinating that, when Cvetic finally broke its cover, it was for the House Un-American Activities Committee instead of the attempt in New York by the Communist Party leaders. There was a moment in the film, where main communist James Millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the House Un American Activities Committee was composed of a bunch of right-wing yahoos who wanted to get their names in front of the camera. Now what could have given him that idea? Anyway just connecting the dots and no doubt their word came from J. Edgar Hoover trying to give some credence to HUAC by having an effective undercover coming out there rather than by a concrete trial. Little thing called cross-examination. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers, who produced me as a Communist for the FBI, later produced Big Jim McLain, who starred John Wayne on a HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC started to credit for the work done by Honolulu PD by breaking up a communist spy there among the dockers. But at least in John Wayne's movie, no one claimed that it was a documentary. Frank Lovejoy is in the title role of Cvetic, and his FBI handlers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a schoolteacher in Pittsburgh who says there are 30 or so in the school system that indoctrinates the youths among those who are Ron Hagerthy, the son of Lovejy's. She has a change of heart about the Communists and Lovejoy must save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors. Ironically, the Hart left the movies and went to work for anywhere, the United Nations, which we, as we know, have often accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br/> <br /> Over half a century later, we have really very few objective works on film or in print on the Communist Party of the United States. They were actually a very active bunch in the labor movement. The real heroes of stopping them were laborers like Walter Reuther of the UAW or David Dubinsky of ILGWU. But since they were people on the left, they just didn't have the following right to be suitable propaganda material. In any case, I was communist for the FBI's widespread work based on a real life character and a will to the paranoid times.
