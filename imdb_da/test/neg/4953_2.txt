Jack Brooks' quirks are initially somewhat charming and lend to the deliberate struggle-feeling of the beginning of this movie. I found myself angry and angry when I wanted to see this through to the end, hoping that the payout would be worth the very boring wait. <br /> <br /> The Climaxet can't begin to make up for the entire setup. <br /> <br /> Usually one can expect small figures from this genre. But the fact that the wait-before-action index is so high should mean that in the meantime it would be devoted to an interesting character development. <br /> <br /> Not so. <br /> <br /> Although not without its original charm, this film ultimately infuses and draws. <br /> <br /> I want to be able to get all that setup time back in order to reinvest it into something that pays off.
