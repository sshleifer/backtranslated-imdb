The protagonist of this sex-filled drive, Mel (Ethan Hunt), notes on several occasions: "She deserves better than this!" The "she" he refers to is Ginger, played by beautiful Brandy Davis who actually deserves better than this. Brandy deserves better than this movie, its lame script and perverted Mel. A guy who is about to see her dream girl, has sex with another man, even in the virtual world, she NEVER deserves. An A for the simulated sex scenes, an F for the script.
