I am an animator myself and a whole buff of the medium, so when I watched this movie in a $ 5 bin, I figured it was worth taking a shot in my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library, this movie was absolutely disappointing. The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect stone to give the girl he loves as the penguin corresponds to an engagement ring, but before he can give it to her, he is thrown out of an evil rival and lost to sea. He then turns to another penguin who helps him find his way home. Creating is not great, but it is enough to create what could be a fun adventure. Unfortunately, the exploits of the duo are never really great and it all becomes rather repetitive. Most of the situations they find themselves in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity ... and the bonding of the two in the hallway is cheeses and forced. <br /> <br /> The animation is good but not up to Don Bluth's usual standards. This is the guy who gave us The Secret of Nimh, Land Before Time and an American Speech, all of which had an attention to detail that often surpassed Disney, the granddaddy of feature animation. This is not so far beyond the high end TV show. <br /> <br /> The music is okay but pretty forgettable, and the voice actors are all wasted talent ... Martin Short is especially wasted here as the protagonist who, despite being counted as a bumbler, is practically a straight man through the entire movie. In short, the film will probably appeal to very young children, but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it does not have what is required.
