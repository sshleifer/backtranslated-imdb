Tru Calling was good, but it could have been good. The concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that could have been explored in the future. Unfortunately, the script and an actor make the show. <br /> <br /> The writing wasn't that bad, but there were holes. In episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison was apparently used to kill the victim. This was so poisonous and killed so quickly that the victim did not have time to run or even scream for help. Yet there was no likely explanation for how the killer achieved such a strong poison. In episode 15, "The Getaway", the off-duty policeman reacted unrealistically. In the second dining room, he (suddenly) tells the robber to drop the gun, and when she doesn't follow the order and in fact turns the gun in its direction, he allows it to become a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation? The situation he had been warned about. His answer should (would) have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow her order and by turning the gun on him. There are other errors in the stories, but I will leave it with these two examples. Despite the typos, I seemed like the show. <br /> <br /> The other problem I had was that I just couldn't accept Eliza Dushku in this roll. In my opinion, she is inexperienced and easy to carry this part. She never went anywhere, she marched; and all too often she came to a sudden stop on her brand. <br /> <br /> She also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation. She has either a pensive look or a sweet smile; other emotions are rarely seen. As she tries to seem dramatic, she begins to look away and "turn" her eyes to her fellow. Or alternatively, she begins to look at her opposite and then looks away. Both are annoying when made as a substitute for true emotions. An example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two Weddings and Funeral", during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotions (eg, hearts in our hearts). I liked all the other actors in their respective parts and they were all trustworthy. With improved writing and a lead change, Tru Calling may have done so.
