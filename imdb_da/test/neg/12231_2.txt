To the post, I hate spoofing movies. Except for Mel Brooks and the flight plan! because they are classics and make fun of clich√©s, not the movies themselves. I think the spoof film is the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "geniuses" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and MEET SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I decided to give COMEBACKS a look. When Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of their movies. It was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame nursery jokes and disturbing images of body damage that would make me laugh and failed. Only someone loud would laugh at these jokes. Toilet bowl? Who wrote this? an 11 year old? I was surprised to see that this was the creation of WEDDING CRASHERS, which was actually quite decent. But there were attempts at the spoof genre just as fun as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (as it clearly deserved one) was because Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with this.
