While the movie has a redemption function, namely some striking images, e.g. the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree, the funeral process of the fleet or the boats of the villages that left the village (which seemed to be affected by the scene when warships approaching the amazing "Fellini Satyricon"), these were more photographic than filmographic and would have been better Appreciated hanging on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in a painfully slow movie that comes into a huge 162 minutes and suffers from horrible dialogue, extremely poor character development, action, uninspired symbolism and heavy stylization. This is the first movie I've seen of Angelopoulos, and his reputation has predicted him, I expected much better, but can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I won't go out of my way to see some of the director's other work in the future. The four friends I went to see it agreed.
