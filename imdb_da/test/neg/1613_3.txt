This movie takes the plunge behind the sci-fi girl "Doppelganger" (an astronaut from our earth, colliding on a "ground" on the opposite side of the Sun and the total war vibes on that world of the Cold War) and trying to turn it into a pilot for a television series. However, it all sank without trace, and television is probably better at it. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is perfectly suited in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. It also does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the robust individualist whose own existence poses a threat to the foundation of the world order against the earth. <br /> <br /> But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and movie history keeps this sci-fi adventure close to scratch. <br /> <br /> I will give an example: In the original template for this pilot ("Doppleranger"), astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle during thunderstorms and crash their ship in a truly horrible order (it was obvious that their ship would never fly again). Then, the two astronauts helplessly stumble from the smoking residue of their vehicle in the middle of howling rain and wind, only to be knocked down and overcome by faceless men shouting through loudspeakers. In "Stranded in Space", the astronauts sit in their seats when the buzzers sound, things start to shake and the camera blurs in a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was quite obvious that the actors just shook their seats, the director was Don't shake the camera or set). I have seen episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that took more effort to create mood and attitude than this television mean. <br /> <br /> And that's essentially what's wrong with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just to make symbolic movements and hope that the sci-fi Fan Boys imagination and enthusiasm will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone here just finished their work on this and went away and never thought about it again, except as a listing on their C.V. And that's what you, the viewer, will do. You will remember if you press once you saw a television movie called "Stranded In Space", but it made no lasting impression on you and you can't remember too much about it.
