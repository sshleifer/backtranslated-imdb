Although not really terrible, this movie is still a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionistic picture of Beach Boys history. In principle, this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters have evolved beyond a one-dimensional parody, but it's a TV movie, so what do you expect? Mike Love's faint stench is everywhere this turkey as he tries to rewrite history with himself in the role of band character and resident genius. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the music is excellent. Unlike the former Beach Boys made-for-TV bio-pic "Summer Dreams", this movie actually contains real Beach Boys music, rather than anemic cover versions ... It also has a surprising number of Beach Boys related rarer and rarely-whole track - The sunbeams "I live for the sun" is just one example. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally shown in two parts on American network TV. The first part is the top of the two and documents Boys's early days and rises to the top. When the time rolls around, the Brian Wilson character has become a pure cartoon and the actor seems to be laughing - but how can anyone take this shed seriously? If you're not a Beach Boys fan, you probably won't get much out of this movie except for an extremely combed and one-sided display of band history. But then again, why would you see this if you weren't a fan?
