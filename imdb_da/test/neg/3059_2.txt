When this film came out in 1996, director Mark Lester had made tight, sharp, small B-action pictures for more than 20 years. He was responsible for the big "Truck Stop Women" from the 70's and several other little beads; Unfortunately, he is also responsible for this dud. It's a shame to see the talented - and still smoking hot - Theresa Russell once again wasted, but she's still the best actor in this picture. Eric Roberts shows up for a while, goes his Eric Roberts thing, then goes away, an unwelcome event on a photo with Eric Roberts in it. Frank Stallone is actually not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how truly pathetic this image is. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes - which are the reason for an image like this - are created in the first place - almost completely illogical and unrealistic, in addition to being somewhat incomplete. Apart from some "vintage" clothes and a few old cars, there is no feeling for the 1930s, the era in which this movie is set. A by-the-numbers script with annoying expiration in logic and little historical accuracy - this is not a documentary, of course, but the filmmakers could at least have tried some authenticity - and notions ranging from class B to class school relegate this cheap little quickie to 4:00 sunday castle on HBO which is just where i saw it.
