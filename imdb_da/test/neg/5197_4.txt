I feel in conflict with this movie - it is one of the most beautiful films I've seen and gives an insight into a lost culture. There was an early scene of men in caps and mustache sitting around a table with a woman serving and an accordion game that brought tears to her eyes just because of the way it caught a lifestyle that must be incomprehensible for many today. It presents the characters' lives as inextricably linked to the village's life, another lost concept in today's world. Symbolism is always fun, but it seemed a bit dated. The film's fatal error in the film was the lack of a compelling dramatic drive and a complete lack of humor. I never felt that I knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving for the loss of a loved one, etc. The people were spelling figures in the director's taboos with natural disasters, war, etc. The movie was just a beautiful tragic scene after another, without involving narrative threads and no humanity. As a result, it appeared very abstract, irrelevant to the life of real people. In the end, I was sorry to see it.
