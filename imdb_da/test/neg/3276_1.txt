I saw this on sale - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and said "hey! An action movie with that guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, directed by the guy who went into the Dragon - and it's cheap!" So I bought it. Oops! This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some doozies. <br /> <br /> Do you know how films that are intentionally campy like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive are AWESOME? You know how to make movies that were serious, but turned out so horrible that you have to laugh aloud and see them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's Vampires, is it pretty cool? This movie, Ironheart, manages to be some of them. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking, but it looks like this movie was made without time shooting, no budget for anything, and no script to talk about. (While standing on the manuscript, I must point out that Bolo Yeung has no lines in this movie - the only reason he gets the first billing on the box is that he is the only actor in the movie you will ever recognize ( Unless you are a Jackie Chan fan, in which case you will recognize the bad guy - and you want to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What's also sad is that this movie is from '92. At that time, T2: Doomsday came out, so you know that the 80's fight is gone ... but not quite.After this you will think of the 80s Chuck Norris movies, high school comedies and Jason / Freddy sequels were works of pure genius. <br /> <br /> Knowing: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can shop for prayers. The closest you get is Richard Norton looking appropriately rich and cocky, and Bolo Yeung looks appropriate means ... and the cockroach. Everything else is terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) Martial arts scenes are forgettable - just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking their shirts, shouting, running on Britton Lee, being kicked by Britton Lee, being beaten by Britton Lee and then fall down. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short and just as creative as the design of my running socks (and just as smelly). 3) The rest of the action is also pathetic: the guns look just like they came from the toy department at K-Mart, and they actually burn with the sound of a capgun. When someone gets shot, they jump around in a little while, then they have brown-red liquids on their clothes. Britton Lee apparently gets shot in the side, but you can't see it at all, so later in the day you'll see the wound ... I've had paper cuts that were worse than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course dress the girl hurt, then they kiss, then the next thing you know they are lying in bed and talking after sex. Huh? What? Trustworthy development of love's interest, as well as any kind of character development at all, is completely ignored in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters didn't have to have sex with someone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) The car trip is by far the worst I have ever seen. It seems that the instructor was sitting on the edge with a handheld camera when the two cars woven down the road and I don't know about 30 miles an hour? Don't try this home, kids, these people are professional! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Really bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but her car is too slow. So when she catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a fight going on. Lee has killed two bad, but the third shooter at Lee when the girl almost runs Lee over so the bad guy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car can bode and she can't start it. She tells Lee that she is involved now and she comes with him. He points out to her that they cannot leave their car there, because the evil ones will trace it to her. She somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem - then he shoots the thought and blows her car. (And remember later that same evening, do they have sex.) Huh?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look closely, the dancers for more than half of the nightclub cushion are very synchronized with the music. The dancers are also too co-ordinated with each other (apparently in the 80s all people took dance clubs dance classes). There is a girl in the DJ cabin with a microphone, but she never does anything but dance. Bouncers tell people who are struggling to "take it outside" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only bouncers Lee and Stevo pass right inside the entrance, but with their backs to it! Also, if you are a big character in the movie, you can also go straight to the line's head. <br /> <br /> Lee notices the first time he is being followed, but he doesn't 'Not the second time - even if it's the same guy in the same car. The girl notes however. Bad guys are followed twice, but they never feel. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that the evil ones will trace the girl's car back to her, even though they have already seen him appear where she works twice. The girl continues to leave her child at work, in the care of a friend while she is out of having sex with Lee. DO NOT read parents from this movie! <br /> <br /> Don't think of more grips right now ... you get the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not even fun, it's SAD.
