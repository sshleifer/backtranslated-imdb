Back in 2002, when Matthew Lawrence made The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If Comebcaks were released in March (as planned) when TMNT was released, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Granted, Matthew Lawrence did a fine job that made up a quarterback. He had to resort to pronouncing dirty words, which is a plus. But when he started playing with his private parts as well as another soccer player and touching a girl's boob, it was the minus. <br /> <br /> But the biggest minus that crossed me is that every soccer player participated in the mock music video, except Matthew Lawrence (the insert price is right loser horn)! Another blown musical opportunity for him just because he is shy to make music. <br /> <br /> Previously, Matt has disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad), where he came so close to having a musical moment, but ended up failing. Joey had a singing career with two albums for his belt, and Andrew started his own music career. But it is very rare to find a Matt musical moment. The two who stand out would be on Brotherly Love, where he played the guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote by the way, and the romantic boy Meets World moment where he sang "This Lady "(As time goes by.) Matt, you've been playing jocks for too long. Why not make a musical comeback. You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
