I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old bored me. The chips are cute ... but the story is all too obvious. Not recommended for young people with the least sophisticated taste. <br /> <br /> We heard a couple of laughs from the audience while we were present; but I wondered why. <br /> <br /> I never admit to being a "chipmunks" fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy-handed display of 'success for young spoils'. We've seen more than enough of it with Britney Spears, et al, haven't we? <br /> <br /> Don't bother.
