I was surprised by the director Antal's Check back in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive, but a decent start. Armor is his second function, and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the key premise has all the ingredients for twists and ensemble cast with many quality actors should be able to deliver. Number could have made a big hoist movie, but instead go to an action girl. Then again he could have shot a cold action girl, but it doesn't live in that department either. <br /> <br /> What you are left with is an unhappy situation after another. A group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp filmography, cast and the tight music score, you're back with what could have been a below average direct-to-video with Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This was probably the most disappointing movie for me for some time.
