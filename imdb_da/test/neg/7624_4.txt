After his success with a nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided for some reason that his next project would be this television movie. I'm not a big fan of this instructor at all; Early exploitation of the flick The last house on the left as well as his modern scare Scream sits well with me, but the rest of his work is very hit and miss, and I would hesitate to call him the master who others have labeled him as. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it is more a stepping stone to the plot rather than an important part of the movie. The main influence here is of course the excellent 1974 zombie movie Deathdream, and we focus on Miles Creighton; a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident, which means he must be thawed immediately. Miles is part of a project for people who are sick; They pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can be cured. Miles are resurrected successfully, and it is seen as a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not the person who was frozen as Miles returns without a soul. <br /> <br /> This movie could actually have been pretty decent judging by the idea behind it, but instead we get a plot that doesn't really have much to it and it must be said that Craven doesn't make the best of it of the film's potential. The soul is the most important focal point, but it seems that one does not have a soul and simply has a murderous intention / no compassion is the same thing that feels a little unimaginative. The film was made for television so it's not very ugly, and it is obvious that not much money was spent on it, as the whole production feels very cheap. Michael Beck never became a very popular actor and it is not surprising to judge by his performance here; While acceptable, he lacks basically charisma and is not formidable in the central role. The plot does not flow too badly, but there is a real lack of tension and / or tension, and things are slowly going too much, resulting in the film becoming rather boring at times. It all boils down to a predictable ending as well. Overall, I must admit that I was not at all impressed with this movie, and as far as Craven's filmography goes, Chiller would go down with Shocker, Scream sequels and The Hills Have Eyes II as a miss.
