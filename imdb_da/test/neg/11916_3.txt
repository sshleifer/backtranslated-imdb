I just spent the last half hour reading through the other reviews and I don't know if I will laugh or cry. There is no way that ADJL is like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fair OddParents, other than a secret magic world that has been close to overdone. Also, no way is ADJL anime. Anime is very a drawing style (and some will say more like plot and Japanese origin), whether ADJL is not anime, so stop saying it is and if you are looking for something like anime, see where , like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all other Disney shows. An arrogant protagonist who thinks he knows everything and doesn't bother listening to people older than him and continues to make the same mistakes. Best friend sidekicks. Repeative plot with a touch of a twist. And sibling rivalry. Can't they even make a character that has brains and isn't full of itself? Can't they get children to respect their elders? Can't they think of something else with the plot? Can't they get the siblings to come together and not hate each other? ADJL is just too generic because you also have evil that is defeated and returned, and are also complete idiots who have no background for their hatred. You will think that a person who is at least 30 will be able to cope with a 13 year old. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost anything else on TV today, same thing over and over again. Nothing special, just new design characters and a little idea that has been used again and again.
