For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation may be fine. But only for them. This is an inconsistent "Cliff Notes" version of Mansfield Park, and if you haven't seen another version or read the books, parts of it will be the main scraps. Why has it been so difficult to make a good adaptation to this book? The one in the 1990s took such freedoms that it hardly seemed to be the same book - the mindset was quite modern and wise. <br /> <br /> Here we have Billie Piper, which looks like a beautiful landscape. She has a charming personality that develops nicely - but she has flagrantly dead blonde hair, with black eyebrows and - through much of the image - dark brown roots. So much for unspoiled cousin. It is incredibly distracting, and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair, space-rich clothing genre, which shows a real respect for the accuracy of the period. One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. She is a perfect note, flirtatious without being modern or suggestive, flippant and complete without a moral or ethical compass. Henry here is actually good enough to be a little temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in history and actually makes her boring to her last scene - too much sense. This is just a production that really lacked the brand, a really low for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only usable version is one with odd duck (perfect for the role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very very gay Henry Crawford - he's just ridiculous).
