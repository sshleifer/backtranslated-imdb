What we have here, the Disney standard direct to the DVD sequel, where I expect cots, is cut in all areas, resulting in an okay animated movie that falls very little of the original. This is not to say that this is a horrible movie. It's just that it is a very mediocre film full of sermons that will show the children the virtues of friendship and be cozy with each other, and unless it is done subtly (which it is not here) can quickly become the grid for adults. The film has a very thin plot line with Kronk who tries to win his father's approval and ends up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. This has it's comedy moments, but is real or not enough to carry a full-length movie.
