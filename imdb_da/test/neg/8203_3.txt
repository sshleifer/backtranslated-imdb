A group of seven people fear that they are the only survivors in a near world ending H-bomb blast. Not only do they fear the radiation but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. One of the groups is already polluted, but strictly constitutes no real threat to the others. Just surviving the friction of different personalities up close is the subplot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge and plays a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl who is destined to start filling a brave new world. Not one of Director Roger Corman's best. This is predictable black and white sci-fi.
