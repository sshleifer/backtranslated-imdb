Hmmm! is the worst movie ever? Good for some of the thrown it is a shame to see them in such a movie, but hey, if it pays the bills, why not, as for the movie well. OK cg effects not too bad for such a cheap movie, music is just about OK again for a cheap movie, than credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> BAD to many to list but cast, play, set, script , ending .. what the hell drac .......... worst drac ever!, many more but can't be bothered to put them all down. The idea was OK, but it was necessary ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and changing all the bad points, however, I say to watch this movie so you can say "What FU% $ was all about" as The credits run.Also its kind one just need to look to see how bad it is.
