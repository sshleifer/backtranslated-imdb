Well, some people can go to see this to see a rough rubber and pvc dressed bisexual vampire kills some ass. If that's what you want and you wear a cap, put your teeth on points and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, then you'll see a nice movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most, an assassin dressed in shiny, creaking rubber with great cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you want to see. I laughed so hard I almost cried. Ridiculous action, dialogue, and planning help make this a better spoof than Dracula, Dead and Loving. It could be. It's trying to be cool and goth, and all the success in doing every scene is fun. Even the sticky lesbian scene is fun (how * did she get the boots of it fast? They were twisted up to * here * ...) <br /> <br /> Don't watch it if you like good movies. See it if you like horrible movies and will laugh until you fall over .... It's not good, it's just bad.
