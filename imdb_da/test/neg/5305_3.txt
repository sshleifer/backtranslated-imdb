Chili Palmer is tired of making movies and knowing that he wants success in music. Being a half mafioso half expert dealer, he wants to rise in the music market. But know that everyone is like him and makes the good singer Linda Moon record a hit, it becomes harder as expected. The first part is fun and filled with irony, it falls into the small jokes and has many less good moments. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their part. Most of the film is made with histrionic character, exaggeratedly exaggerated (a little is ok, too much is disgusting), and the only one you can save is gay bodyguard, who is at least coherent, the rest is too much idiot. The most surprising thing is that the movie is not boring, everything happens so fast, and so many things happen that you don't have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie. It can offend your intelligence (much!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But it's not boring.
