I saw the start of this on a Friday, mid-day, while working at home at the computer, relaxing a little after a hectic week and clearing up some files and responding to some messages. Was interrupted a couple of times, so it had trouble getting all the details straight (although there are no Hitchcock proportions, where missing details can go through the whole story off-kilter) and moreover, it was not exactly an "exciting" piece of work . <br /> <br /> So under a commercial, read the only previous comment here (by "mgconlan-1") and pretty much agree with its details. <br /> <br /> Not quite in the category of a movie so horrible it is fascinating "good", but I would like to catch on tape when running again (instead of seeing it as aired), so I can fast forward as needed and see the parts that I missed this first time. Give it a "3 *" because of the attraction of the four primary people.
