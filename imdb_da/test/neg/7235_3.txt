I have to say I've seen worse Sci Fi Channel originals, but this Nu Image shonker from Yossi Wein was still right. The big problem with it is that it is simply not convincing, not just its creation, but acts, writes and attempts at drama. The direction lacks any kind of flair, and the manuscript from Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never seems real, predictable, often ridiculous, while delivering less howlers than a real pair of these kinds of movies, never giving anything to engage or increase the pulse. The actors do their best, but with such material their work effort has little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is a softly observable hero, Meredith Morton, who resembles a dull attentive love interest. In fact, she was a little less convincing, but at least she was easily in the eyes. The movie has at least the dignity to bowl at a reasonable pace, but the biggest plus is that the octopus is not completely CGI reproduced. So even though it doesn't look good, there are at least a couple of legit scenes of characters who suddenly struggle with rubbery tentacles in a rather entertaining way. I also chuckled on the differences between different representations of squid, because shots of the creature as a whole vary throughout the film, they are also different not only in size but look to the practical images of it, and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests the decision makers were left as if they were making a squid film and only imagined their creations as a lot of different tentacles. The scenes in the creature are attacking people getting old pretty fast, but there are some fun scenes where it takes on other things like a boat and a crane. Yes, these scenes are poor, but they made me laugh. Undeniable highlight, however, is a hilarious order, where the octopus takes a New York landmark, the scene may not be much more than a minute, but it is truly inspired and worth looking at youtube. Apart from the fact that things are uninspired all the way around (a PG level lack of gore or nastiness stops this from even pulling much into the garbage good times) the movie takes a trip to the semi gripping disaster movie area at the end, but I can't really give it credit because the best pictures in the last few scenes were deleted from the Stallone Flick Daylight (which, in my memory, is pretty good). All in all, it was pretty rubbing stuff and not something I would really recommend to anyone except creatures that die hard. Better than a dot in the eye with a wet stick, but not too much.
