I was willing to love "Where's Poppa", it has the nexus of Normal Lear sitcom character actors who, when I grew up, felt like extended members of my raisenette-big broken nuclear family. How fun it would be to see censorship-free Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and a pre-SNL Garret Morris. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the "Where's Poppa" dragons are. It is claustrophobic and plodding, and breaks the cardinal rules of the farce, the mood of the voice and a fast pace. The plot involves a lawyer's efforts (George Segal) to get rid of his indulgent Jewish mother living in his gigantic New York apartment. Along the way we are exposed to ridiculous characters and situations: a comic group of pitchers who repeatedly wage the protagonist's brother, rape a policeman involving a gorilla dress and subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden pulls down Segal's pants and bites ass as he serves his dinner Why doesn't this work? Part of the explanation is the sense of judgment created by narrow, dark interiors and antique decorations. I eat absolute movie in New York this age, but watching the movie felt like I was flipping through the police in a dark bus station. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, is the slow pace. Modern MTV style fast cuts have changed what movie guests feel is a pleasant editing pace, but even taking this into account, camera images are kept for too long. Plot development is also very slow. There is a situation where this works: A strange love song George Segal sings to Trish Van Devere, gentle, very close to her face and for an eerie long period. It reminded me of the cringeworthy extended shots in the British version of "The Office" where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away and at the same time you can't stop looking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the movie is more "hurry up" than "can't see away". It made me wonder if it is possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that gravity of the subject in a black comedian tends to weigh the father's ease. Movies like Robert Altman's "M * A * S * H" and Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" show that it can be achieved. They do it not only through speed, but also through entertaining subplots, something "Where's Poppa" neglects. <br /> <br /> Although the movie features several stereotypically fun characters, almost everyone is directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the conflicting mother. The scenes with Garret Morris and Central Park muggers are as close as the viewer gets a mental break. The muggers almost seemed to Shakespearean, following the tradition of comic ne'er-d0 wells. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" had stuck a little closer to the stage tradition, it would have been a better movie. Edgier is not always better. It is as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner took a short time before the 70s creative flour flow. <br /> <br /> Random Notes: After taming Ron Liebman's clothing, the pitcher Cornel Wilde mentions "The Naked Prey" (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to the 1968 "Apes Plane". As politically incorrect as he was, it is troubling to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as Charleton Heston. Linda Harrison, who played "Nova", Taylor's brave friend, said that James Fransicus in the sequel seemed to be sweet and small compared to Heston.
