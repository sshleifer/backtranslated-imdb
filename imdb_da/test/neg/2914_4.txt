I would have a little to add to the bowlofsoul23's thief-eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and resident in Rio de Janeiro, in a neighborhood just a few miles away from Favela Vigário Geral, depicted in the film) to comment on US-funded "Favela Rising" here at IMDb, I get mixed feelings : On the one hand, it is good that the British situation for Brazilian favelas is becoming more aware of filmmakers and the media, both from Brazil and abroad, as local governments have apparently given up long ago. On the other hand, it is incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" turns out to be such a missed opportunity for enlightening non-Brazilian audiences on the problem, for first time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the United States and understandably, neophytes on the matter) makes the biography of AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sá a glamorous canonization in this superficial, one-sided, researched and misleading documentary. Good intentions, confused results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV ad, is low as a first-rate television interview and biased as an advertising video. "Favela Rising" feels uncomfortably fake for a Brazilian viewer and not just because of its hype visual treatment of a gloomy reality, and its misplaced emotional good succeeded. "The City of God" is an obvious reference here, where the COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen came without any apparent reason other than "hype". "Favela Rising" is supposedly a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sa, but beware: When you see the scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio Shore Line, you may as well be warned that Vigário Geral of AfroReggae and Anderson are located in an area of ​​Rio far away from any beach. Strange choice of location, at least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably confusing to non-Brazilians who do not know many of the interviewers (and the movie will not tell them) and will have to wait for the final credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are NOT of the AfroReggae Band (although you become suspicious when you start hearing Pink Martini, of all people!). They also do not want to know that important issues were simply not founded: Why does the film push the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners that provide it with significant financial and logistical support, such as Rio's City Council, private Brazilian companies, multinational registration companies, and international NGOs, without which AfroReggae may not even live? Why not clearly state that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent war wars and that its residents are still in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and the police? Why not clearly state that many of the archive movie clips showing police violence and corruption did not take place in Vigário Geral? WHERE and why did the child Richard Murilo finally register for AfroReggae? WHY was it on a freaking ground not interviewed again at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> As for Anderson, the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer: What is the story of Anderson having "two" mothers? Is the child he holds in his arms, his son? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé woman appear on the beach when the films mention Donald's "miraculous" recovery from the accident? Is he a Candomblé supporter? Why not let him explain the contradiction about starting a group fighting drugs and at the same time praising Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a pride movement for black people from the favelas, why are the girls in the AfroReggae band limited to booty-jumping routines? No, you will not get answers to these questions either. <br /> <br /> Instead, the filmmakers are interested in making Anderson Saw a complex mix of pop stars, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (check out the last picture of Christ's statue, the Redeemers at the top of the Corcovado hill , immediately after Anderson has "miraculously" gone after her surgery). And that's the WORST thing the filmmakers could do for Anderson and his cause: turn him to a special CHOSEN (with the time they show the scars of the operation, you're ready to believe it's a sign from God). <br /> <br /> Because what's remarkable about Anderson - who's the most common guy you could ever meet - is that he helped change his environment NOT by being "special" but by copying and customizing winning projects (such as Olodum movement in Bahia) to its own community with strong support from friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. If you are not fluent in Portuguese, you will probably not notice that Anderson is not particularly bright or articulate (as opposed to his sharp witty partner José Junior), as much as he is not particularly talented as a singer, poet or musician. Nevertheless, his "ordinariness" may have been the true "inspirational" core of the movie: to show that anyone with idealism, endurance, and stable support can actually contribute significantly to his society, not having to be incarnate of Jesus. Because what really matters is the movement - AfroReggae - not the guy, see? Haven't we had enough of personality cultures? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising" you probably won't know much more about Rio's favelas than you did when you walked in - you just saw the SEEN how some of them look.
