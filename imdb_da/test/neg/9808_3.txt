During filming, Vanessa Redgrave was taking mogadon? It was as if she was reading from an autocue. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe it was all part of the character? Regardless, it was very very annoying, I stopped shaking the screen to hurry up. I read the book a long time ago and didn't like much about it, except that Septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed this well, his acting was all on the surface. The connection between his life and Clarissas is also not well done, but I suppose the attempt is to show the victim's soldiers made to allow people like Clarissa to continue their daring life. The movie is very bitty and has no real unit for it. Hated it
