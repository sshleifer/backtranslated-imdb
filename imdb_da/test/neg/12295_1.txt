Oh, that scared, the indescribable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a first year art school project that is quickly paved together. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here will undermine a painful mix of under-overacting and almost all the scenes were terribly constructed and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film does not reflect Malaysian culture or social conventions - no one even speaks here. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to get a prize in the foreign movie category of a western film festival. And unfortunately this bit seems to have worked. Some reviewers will undoubtedly describe it as "exotic", but a more precise word would be "horrible". <br /> <br />
