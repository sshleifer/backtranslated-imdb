I wasn't sure where this was going to finish. as it turned out, this was all a liberal conspiracy to transfer the world to European wimps and the UN. What a load of right wing! By the way, a little bit about Canada that joined the United States didn't have much to do with the plot at all, and the idea was never developed. The only point in it seems that it made the protagonist entitled to run for president (but they might just have made him American and dispensed with it). In any case, it was a lot of bull and not worth your time. If you want to see this kind of thing go well, check out the amazing BBC political thriller "Play of Play".
