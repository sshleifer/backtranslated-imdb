This movie should be the worst movie from 2007, it was just really bad, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that is as bad, I think they don't do really bad Hollywood movies, do they? ? Hamish should really stick to singing instead of acting because he just can't act at all, God he was just as bad, I think he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Sherawat look like a better actress than him, as for her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it is just so boring to see her, i mean what men see in this woman? yes, she has a god body but where is that talent ??? ? I haven't seen it yet, and at this rate I don't think I will ever. <br /> <br /> Anyway Hamish falls in love with Ria now, this 15 year old girl can act, my God she was the best actor in the movie, and she does not look at all 15, for me she sees at 21, but her performance was brilliant in the movie. bless her, she was really good, i hope to see more of her in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical bollywood movie is still a hiccup (can only happen in a bollywood movie) and both eventually married. <br /> Well, I'd give th music 10/10 it was amazing, it made the movie a hit, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. anyway, the only thing I can say is to go buy the music and not watch the movie.
