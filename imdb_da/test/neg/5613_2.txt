This film was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors. That is, the premise is interesting and sold. I mean, I rented it out from synopsis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the original concept. There is no coherent plot, no fully developed characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises and no good performances (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It is as if the people who illuminated this thing never read the script, but only synopsis. And if there were enough people like me, it could even have made money. <br /> <br /> For the potential viewer: Don't waste your time there is nothing fun or interesting to see here. For the film's creators: Hey, you've got your movie made, so what if it's not that big. Most people never see themselves or their work on the screen.
