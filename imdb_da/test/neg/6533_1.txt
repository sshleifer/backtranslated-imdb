This movie is ridiculous. It is trying to be a comedy, but the manuscript is terrible. The whole movie is made in low light and you cannot understand that it is a comedy. Really is poor filmography. You really have to sit there and see it to realize that there are a few jokes here and there, but somehow they are all within jokes among themselves. This is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. It's really a very meaningless movie. Their expression reveals nothing but horror and disaster, which nevertheless appears. Unless you want to get bored with your ass, I suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.
