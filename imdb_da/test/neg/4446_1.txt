Wow. I thought Eskimo Limon was the most horrible and embarrassing first sex movie ever. But I had forgotten that Germany is always trying to compete. In the present case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. The heart of Jung's is stupid, not credible and predictable, and above all: not fun. It is almost a tragedy that so many children went to see this in Germany (and I am also afraid of Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and to mature to be 15, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke tries really hard to make us believe he doesn't know anything about sex, but it doesn't help. Harte Jungs seems to be made by one who saw Al Bundy and took him too seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who play Schenke's semi-liberal parents. Pearls and Jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in film-making. Yet their performances are the "best" and "funniest" in comparison. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
