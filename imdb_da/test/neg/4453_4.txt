It's strange, this movie; You get the impression that the creators of this snooze party spent more time in the local bars than on the set. In fact, it's a surprise not to see Harry Alan Towers' name on the credits; It certainly has the taste of one of its tax-protected productions, but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for everyone involved to enjoy a long-term stay in Provence. Despite the fact that the film must take place all over the region, Les Baux and the area around it are in almost everything. <br /> <br /> David Birney provides a spectacularly colorless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at a time "you're a walking clich√©". What Lonsdale does in this is anyone's guess. For some reason, the most interesting character played by Rampling is the sidelines, while regardless of the book she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the ability to carry the film (which would have been boring anyway, but that in it at least we had got more of something beautiful to look at). All in all, a pointless affair worth seeing just to see how action-less an action movie can be.
