I don't want to lie, I rented this movie because it was an "arty" movie with some explicit sex. I got that scene and Catherine Deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the movie is just the usual, long pretentious European art films with lines like "Do I have a mother or father, I don't know" (paraphrased). Usually delivered in long soliloquier. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the transition to "art" for porn, it may be an interesting look using the fast-paced button (I was still too slow!)
