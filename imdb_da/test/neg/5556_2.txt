OK, I've seen Hershall Gordon Lewis movie before, but this one really takes the cake, it's really gory and rough, not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in, I'm talking badly, making plan 9 from outer space to resemble hamlet, the only save grace is the late big Henny Youngman as the strip club owner, yes take my wife ... please.the stripteasers are really sexy in 1972, i think they used the same plot again in Roger Corman movie; stripped to kill in 1987. I enjoy the former HGLewis flick 100 maniacs, which was a mini masterpiece of kind but poorly functioning, no prizes here, but be aware that this is a splatter movie that paved the way for Friday The 13th and saw.in a disturbing scene, a half naked stripper has her ass spanked with a meat tenderizer.ugh! morbid stuff here.HG Lewis beats again. 2 out of 10
