Crash is overwhelmed, over-thought and over-baked. A good example of how to make a pompous and self-meaning film with a message. Haggis is trying too hard to make his point and overreaches in almost every category of the movie. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtleties of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure race conditions affect everyone and there is great ambiguity in the issue, but the universe of 'Crash' works to assume that we are all victims of our own perceptions of race. It is a tiring thread that repeats itself to nauseum and rejoices in the first 30 minutes. I found the outcome of the characters surprising and forced, and the film took forever to spit out and die. The fact that the movie is in the top 50 films on IMDb is a testament to the public's willingness to be suckered by Hollywood malarkey. In fact, if you want the right "Crash", check it out one by David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This film plays as preaching, tiring and masochistic.
