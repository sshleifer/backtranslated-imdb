Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But does it really matter? We all know the basics of history, and it has nothing new. But I love low budget horror & science camp classics ... so I forgive this one. About the only thing that anyone remembers from this movie is the little Leonardo DiCaprio who made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did OK. The party didn't ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him any chance to give one anyway ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very sweet ... and it was also the girl. The movie is fun if you like horror & sci fic camp classics and are experienced in seeing them.
