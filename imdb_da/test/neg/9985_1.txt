I found the movie on my local video store and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard of the explicit sex scenes, cruel violence and the infamous debauchery. I sat watching and I started laughing! Set decorations and art direction were cheap and false; nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; The story was badly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his serenity beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) cannot be taken seriously ... it's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were apparently hostage during the film's production, fortunately they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. The kinematics was a joke, and I became even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! The field book no less. If you're looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for camp cult value, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was. I've seen shocking and it's two hours in your life you will never have left.
