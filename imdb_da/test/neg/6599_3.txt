This movie is like so many biopic TV movies I've seen: formal, exaggerated, poorly acted, and most importantly, too little. <br /> <br /> What I mean by that is the movie was filmed and for that matter, sent before Michael Jackson acquitted himself of his child's molestate taxes, which I think was one of the most significant periods in Jackson's life and career so far . It would probably have made a great end to this documentary. However, this film already bites more than it can chew and confuses too much detail in this overly ambitious project. There is no doubt that Michael Jackson might have led the most interesting life so far from any musical, let alone contemporary pop star, to date, and his story would probably take six behind-the-scenes specials to tell accurately. This movie tried to tell too much in three hours and it was unnecessary to say it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did what he could to play Jackson, but he came out more like a SNL caricature by suffering from Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would be rather difficult to find anyone who accurately portrays Jackson without meeting with Pop of Pop himself and studying his methods of madness. On a shoestring budget, however, one can only depend on what they see in tabloids, and they do not necessarily provide a precise representation. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely foolish. The Caucasian make-up on Alexander's face makes him look like a reverse minstrel show, and anyone who has been in a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander. It is also astonishing to me that the movie documents Jackson goes under the knife to get cosmetic surgery, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same size nose. This kind of suspension of disbelief, which the director expects, cannot endure television viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting when the recordings of the real Michael Jackson (ie the time he hung his babies over a balcony in Germany) was blown up in the movie in real time. It was a good attempt, but it just didn't work. <br /> <br /> If this movie as it was released into theaters, it would only win because of its stickiness. It even pales in relation to "Mommie Dearest", and it says a lot. Above all, it was a movie that was probably rushed to make, like many non-HBO television films. It could have been much better if it had just told about one aspect of Jackson's life. Although it just covered the allegations of child morality, it would probably have been done much better and would even have been more exciting.
