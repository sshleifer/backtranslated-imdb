This movie is painful. That is probably the best way to describe it. It is 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to come back. Well, in fact, it's more than 86 minutes because no one wants to sit through the credits in this smelly pile of dog sledding. Immediately you can see that the movie is from the producer of "Mortal Kombat", due to the pounding and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains the few ridiculously fun moments that this movie can give you. The rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters, "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" acting abilities of all involved (including miscast Christopher Lambert) and the non-existent management. Did I leave anything? Of course I did. Let's not forget the suicidal script, with it being an independent (??) fun dialogue. Oh yes, and let's also talk about how they were ashamed of the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. Costumes and weapons (were the giant pizza cutters I kept watching?!?!) Are just stupid, it's the best way I can describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always terrible CGI. When will the filmmakers learn about CGI sugar? When will we see the wonderful effects that were used in the 80s? Probably never, but movies like this and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" make us want them to bring them back. Finally, avoid this movie as the latest Freddie Prinze, Jr. movie. Then again, if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr. movie, you deserve to sit through this horrible excuse for film making.
