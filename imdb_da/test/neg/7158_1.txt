The theaters and drama in the film are fantastic, but the facts and research are far from solid. When Dr. Bovon quotes, where the documentary film tries to establish a connection with Maria Magdalena from Mariamene, clarifies Dr. Bovon later that it should be used for literary purposes (ie, fables of that time), not for a historical figure. In fact, he says he does not believe that the Mariamene Viariot in Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He also commented on his letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information about Philips actions (a literary work in the 4th century). So what we have here is a director who took a clip for a 4th century Acts of Philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century oslo inscription. A very sad stretch and Dr. Bovon calls Jesus / Mary Magdalene the connection as "science fiction" - as this documentary must be rightly labeled.
