As one who loves baseball history, especially the early 20th century, when Cobb was the protagonist, along with a ton of colorful characters, I was delighted to see this baseball movie. Well, it wasn't a baseball movie that was disappointing. No, it was just a sports author's statement to be with Cobb in the ballplayer's later years, while the two were collaborating on a book. Even then, this could have been a more appealing movie than they did. <br /> <br /> Given Cobb was anything but a good guy, an extremely talented player, but brutal because he would do anything to beat you. ... and he was viscous, scary and had many demons to fight. He was so hated his own teammates attempting to prevent his chances of winning a batting title one year. Nevertheless, this is an over-the-top depiction of the man. It makes him something almost cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to an old man rant, rave and profane for two hours is entertainment? No it's not someday I would love to see a real biopic of Cobb showing him in his ballplay days, and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, then it is, but how they did it with just one bitter, blasphemous old The man makes an ass by himself in front of a reporter is not fun to see.
