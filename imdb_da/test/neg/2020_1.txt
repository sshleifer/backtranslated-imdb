My Goodness. And here I thought there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine the number of decisions needed to make a movie. Conceptual approval. Screenplay Writing. Dialog Editor. Casting. Set and plug design. Location choice. Acting. Timing. Photography. Lighting. Music. Audio and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that each of these decisions was made wrong. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> For a movie supposedly put into the 2900s, this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta flick from the 1970s. The set is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is terrible. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. The action is beyond abysmal. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Let's just take props, for example. If you have a movie set on a space freight built in 2900, how likely is it to have the exposed pipelines and hydraulic doors in a 1960-era oil tanker? What has the technology not changed in 900 years? "Professor" uses a standard tandy keyboard and Radio-Shack flipswitches for "reprogramming" the computer. What have they not counted on voice control yet? The Prophet is, of course, bound to a wheelchair. With wheels. Although you know they have intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, much less a floating or bionic leg or something. And apparently, this cargo ship transported an intergalactic shipment of rosewood capsules. How practical. Then there is the weapon - the crew carries standard 19th century weapons. In a ship. In the vacuum in the room, where a bullethole would kill them all. Nice planning there, prop section. <br /> <br /> Oh, why continue.
