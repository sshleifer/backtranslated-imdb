Considering the subject, I thought that this movie would at least be comfortable if you stopped something short of a masterpiece. I was mistaken. I was still waiting for something to happen, and it was finished - I thought the final was the bit that happened before it was exciting. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects boys deserve some recognition.
