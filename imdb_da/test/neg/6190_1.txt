Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and with a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience Casbah and the characters in Algiers, I recommend you not even see this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead, because it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clich√©dic and the characters hold much more reality. Furthermore, the end is so dramatic and the key to Pepes character that you will find the Algiers version unacceptable. Although Alger makes an almost excellent job mimic every scene, the play falls short of the character's credibility. Plus, the wardrobe is really breathable in all scenes, especially Pepe in the last scene and Gaby (at any time), but also when she is on the boat. Frankly, Algiers are cheap as far as imitations go.
