But even caricatures need a plausible plot line. In 1934 I assume that part of the audience long ago would enjoy this weak father. It does not age well. It gives Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles. Pendelton, prominent in the Thin Man series, tries its best, but is over matched by unclear plot. With the background is a stage game with mobsters, it is not exactly original material. The film's saving grace is the always outstanding Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But don't waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would urge anyone to see him in his holiday work with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Same era 1936, but much better script and history. Better gags and needless to say star force too.
