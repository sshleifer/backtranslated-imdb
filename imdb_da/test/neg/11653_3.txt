Based on the previous comments, everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. I think it would be reasonable to point out that although this is not a big movie, it has its interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on the spot in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even for me, who lived in Colorado for several years. Next, it has Disney's penchant for great character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better shape than when playing a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Remember the wonderful Mary Wickes too? Although she has a "bit" in this movie, she is great as always. If you do not know who she is, think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame (she was one of the gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun in the "Sister Act", as well as the best non in "The Problem with Angels". She has always been a great character actress, and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to character actors and all-star casts, Disney in the 1960s and 1970s may not have had "best" movies, but if you really see some of them from the beginning to the end, You should be aware that each movie has a really fun or hysterical moment in it. The whole movie may not be fun, but there is always a cartoon (at least 1 or 2) in every "live action" movie Disney ever made. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his rolling tones, or Tim Conway fluttering, or Joe Flynn gives one of his priceless looks of horror, it's good. The whole movie may not be good, but there are always hysterical moments in every Disney movie from this period that I have ever seen. Disney during this period always managed to make a person smile, despite the film's stupidity. <br /> <br /> Asking for these comments, I disagree with the viewers saying that each Disney movie during this time period is horrible. This statement is not quite correct. Rather, it's easier for me to give credit to the fun moments and overlook the weaknesses of the charters. <br /> <br /> Some live action Disney movies are true classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those who are not, I can appreciate them for what they were - good pure family fun at a time when movies became vulgar, raw and offensive.
