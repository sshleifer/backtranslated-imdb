I can come across the political parody; although it was SUPPOSE for being a "Masters of Horror" girl. But what I can't get over is the blatant use of our warlords (and their victims) as a farmer in some washed up horror maker's political statement. <br /> <br /> To me, it was insulting to deter Arlington and our heroes. I have family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray the Arlingtong tomb is disturbed, just makes me throw. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante and finished with MOH.
