All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of "Laaaaaa-sie!" from little Timmy, or whatever the child is called, laughs his little veil to his border collie friend. These same Americans may not be aware of the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to film (or was it the other way around? I'm ready to do some research here), and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to make a "this movie has gone to the dogs!" sayings, so I do not want (even though I technically only did). But somehow it has. Lassie (playing Shep, man's best friend) gets top billing. DOG MAKES TOP PICTURE. Now I am not aware of how actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how it plays out in my heart: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, in the credits it gets, and with Lassie as Shep ! "LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL: Have, have, kid, calm down, calm! LASSIE: Rrroo rrroro roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, I think I see. Co-lead billing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL: Oh God! Relax my arm! Top Billing! Top billing for you now drop my arm !!! <br /> <br /> Then the dog gets top billing, and with the rest of this shell-shocked throw, I assume it's understandable. We get lovable old grumpus Jonathan prospector, his young, whiny and seemingly orphan friend Tommy, sketchy loser Lin Taylor and loved old religious grumpus Pilot Pete. The flesh of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences so I will save you the actual pain by watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep, and his partner dies while he is on his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin who gets obsessed with the gold, and Jonathan for some reason gives Shep to whiny little crybaby Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees it, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy empties, it gets cold, and Shep performs a detailed plan to avenge Lin, as he (or she) does. The end. Unless you have a deep and unpleasant need to watch a Lassie movie (even then there must be a better Lassie movie than this), just avoid The Painted Hills. When not pulling on, you are amazed at Lassie's limited ability to "act" (similar in style, perhaps to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves), create the obvious with several minutes of film or insulting Native Americans everywhere with his white-actor-in-face paint "Ugh! How! I run bears!" stereotypes, The Painted Hills are only suitable for Lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection to prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin 'that preserves the vein of glittering gold!
