Adela is a rebellious teenager with the belief that she is right and everyone else is wrong. She must be the center of attention and she will act stupidly to do so. With her attitude she is sent to charm school. There she meets the typical characters of today's cinema; the geek, the clumsy, the stepford wife and the sexual minority. Things happen, and eventually Adela learns as little as possible. The reason is trying to carry a deeper meaning for the state of Adela, but completely failing to deliver (at least I didn't buy it). So what's left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. Plus the director seems to have a breast fixation, Adela flashes her breasts sometimes for many, at least I can't see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the movie is ok, but if you are like me and don't like to watch a teen piss out and make a behavioral U-turn in a moment that I found very incredible, think twice before looking at.
