Even as a big fan of the low to no budget horror genre, I couldn't find this disaster mildly fun. With horrible plays, a painful generic "plot" and non-dimensional characters, no matter how boring and drunk you are, this is not worth your 81 minutes. Don't make the same mistake I made. Rent something else. Anything else!!!
