This movie is horrible. If you're considering watching this movie ... two words, don't. It is tasteless, the story is really paralyzed, and the jokes are even worse. The action is really pathetic. I can't believe this movie was made. Rather see American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you're in the mood for a teenage comedy. It's about two girls leading to Malibu on their Spring Break. As usual, they didn't care much about planning and calling (I think she names Michelle) uncle to collide on his Malibu mansion. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them to have any kind of party, and as you would guess, they go ahead and do it. Please, I urge you not to watch this movie.
