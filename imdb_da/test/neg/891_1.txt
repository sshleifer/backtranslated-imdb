I am also a House Party Fan ... House Party I am my favorite movie all the time. House Party 4 is a disgrace to all HP's and Kid n Play ... This was supposed to be part of a series really .. There was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans .. kid n play was probably too old to throw a House Party movie b / c its kind focused on teens .. but kid n play could at least have made a cameo look ... you can tell how good it was b / c it did Not even that for the theaters. Older were in party 3, so it was sensible for them to continue the legacy ... but they should have represented right ... they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have seen House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990 (16 years ago) and I have been the fan since. When I first saw House Party 4, I was like what they really think about. There was nothing familiar with this movie that would compare to the previous 3 films. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller holiday.
