I'm always interested in watching neglected movies that seem to have good credentials, but in this case, the film's neglect seems justified. Apparently, based on some actual World War II events, the movie just isn't connected to the viewer for some reason that it's not quite clear to me. A very likely reason is that - in the print I saw on TCM, anyway - none of the scenes where the Germans spoke to each other got titles. This interesting direct concept - to let the non-German-speaking viewer just guess from "context" what the Germans say to each other - is in my book a whole flop and helps to unlock the viewer. Also the way the film begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" reputation are not challenged by this flick.
