The word honor must be deleted from the vocabulary of all nations. It exacerbates male stupidity and is responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people. Anyone who does not agree should not like to continue reading this comment. <br /> <br /> As can be expected from these screenwriters, Yakuza is an exciting detective with a great respect for the ethnic background on which he was acting. Friends of gore and violence are also not disappointed, but especially at the end the violence becomes meaningless, superfluous and rather stupid. Unlike other reviewers, I found Robert Mitchum's performance not very good. This is an actor who definitely did not improve with age. He looks like a tired guardian (it doesn't go too well with that part), and his air of secession that made him such an impressive screen presence in previous years comes as confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as honorary and young, intelligent and numb. <br /> <br /> The best way to stand on this movie is to see it as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by the Mitchum sign, which asks the Takakura character a service based on incorrect assumptions. The error quickly becomes apparent, but the sense of honor requires them not to come back. Then they begin to sneak around, shoot in all directions, swing swords and destroy their friend's artistic occasion (though the guy cares for them, stop it, please "through the corresponding match.) The bodies begin to dart and the story ends with Mitchum character makes his point: If you give him your finger finger, I'll give you mine. Well, that's the least he can do, can't he? (Outside the box fortunately). It was a moment that probably should have been solemn, it just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of places is very good in this movie. liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto Protocol was signed there). For me, the presentation of architecture seems better here than in Sydney Pollack's newer documentary sketches by Frank O. Gehry who is about architecture and nothing else.
