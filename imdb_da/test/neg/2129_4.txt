I really wanted to like this movie, as I admire Italian rip-off cinema (especially Jaw's rip-offs!), But the simple fact is that Monster Shark is not very good. All signs of this are a large piece of waste there; We have one of the king of trashy cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors Michael Sopkiw, who takes the lead and a central being stupid enough to give the best that this kind of film has to offer a race for it's money, but somehow the movie still manages to be quite obsolete. The fact that "monster shark" is not too often is probably a good thing given the creature design, but there is never enough anywhere else to pull the film through without it. The plot focuses on a resort off Florida's south coast (or rather, a place in Italy) where several local people have come up in the water with arms and legs missing. It is not long before the local authorities decide that this creation has never been seen before and it is up to a modley crew member of various gardening experts to capture the living! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that it always feels very pointless, and since there is little in the way of signs or plot development, even the least demanding viewers are likely to start boring long before. This kind of movie is hardly famous for being brilliant, although the fun element of movies like "The Last Shark" and "Killer Fish" is unfortunately not present for most of the time. What I love about lead actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to take him seriously regardless of the movie he is in (even though he only made four). This is certainly the case here, although Bava never really allows him to dive in, and often he feels as much as a spare wheel as the rest of the movie. Much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup American stock, and it's not that fascinating; even though Bava is doing well in the end with an entertaining action fight as the central monster finally gets to destroy his wild hunters. Overall, there really isn't much to recommend this movie to. As mentioned, I really like this kind of thing and even me I was sad several times. For hardcore Italian horror fans only!
