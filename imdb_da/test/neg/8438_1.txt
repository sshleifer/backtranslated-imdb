The sound is horrible, the picture is worse than worse, the play is terrible, the female leading actress is silly, and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ...! The reason is really bad, and the film's title is misleading. If you expect to see Piranhas, you may be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha films of 1978 and 1981. In fact, I can only think of a scene involving Piranhas. The only thing I liked about this movie, besides the fact that it only runs for about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It's written and sung by Jim Stein and it's called "Love All Things That Love The Sun". <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It's so bad, it's not even fun to see. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I'm the kind of person who sees something.
