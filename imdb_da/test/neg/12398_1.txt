Imagine the most clich√© rides b-movie horror plot you can. Add more plot holes than plot. Written by a 10 year old. Have the play by A-Level drama students fail really bad American accents (on the Isle of Man!) Add monster special effects, which the lovers of B & W Dr Who Shows will appreciate. Result: duff movie. Throw in Samantha Janus take off clothes (make a point on this on the cover) and you will probably sell enough copies to win anyway!
