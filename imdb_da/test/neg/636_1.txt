It is far beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed. The dialogue was so bad that it was sick. Train and helicopter scenes seemed to have been done on flashcards of high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips should have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown by a private screening, after which he probably left the back door. The only feeling it aroused in me was pity about the throw, they had to "bite the ball" to get through it. I couldn't stand to see it all, it was so predictable that it was fun. Who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.
