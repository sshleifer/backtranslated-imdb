Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Should I continue? There is one I repeat * a * fun scene in the whole, drawn-out, anti-funny amateur-hours special of a movie: Fares father's fat father knocks anyone over with his beer fighter. That is it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark, bored Swedish "actors", who provide dialogue that goes into one ear and secondly, a banal story, dull direction and good, a little different worth mentioning. Nepotistically cast Fares Fares is as charismatic as a chartered accountant and his nose rivals even Adrien Brody with regard to sheer ridiculous hardness. Torkel Petersson was only to work with Lasse Spang Olsen. The rest of the casting is fortunately easy to forget, while Fares' humongous, titanic nose will always haunt me in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares helps destroy Swedish films. Do not support him and his nonsense. Jalla Jalla is comedies what Arnold Schwarzenegger is about to trade with, Kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a non-budget Youtube video, and Zozo was simply the most pretentious, pseudo-touching waste ever released by a Swedish director. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish movies can be so much better than this, so stop letting Color Play be worth watching just because they are "good at being Swedish". Please.
