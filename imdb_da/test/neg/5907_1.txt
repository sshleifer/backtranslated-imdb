This movie I am not quite funny and I can imagine being quite offensive to Jewish people. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First, the entire film depicts the protagonist Zucker as a lier / cheat who runs shady shops and offers while his son is gay, his daughter is lesbian, and his niece is a slam. Then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family, first his daughter with his Joshua and Jana, and saw his son with his niece. Two incestuous conditions run in the family. I am surprised that they did not add the act of having a mentally handicapped in the family ... Now it really would complete the Nazi ideal sub-human! (gay, lesbian, Jewish ...) <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting movie. I'm surprised this movie doesn't get a response from any Jewish community.
