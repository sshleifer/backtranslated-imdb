Occasionally I remove the television after "South Park" and I end up catching some of the train wrecks of middle school humor that is "Mind of Mencia". This is the only time I wish my room was cleaner because I could find the remote so much faster. The truth is, Comedy Central needed a replacement "Chappelle's Show" and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots who either miss Dave so much they want to cling to any minority show show or are happy with the delete " Mexicans love tacos' jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels every week. However, I understand that there are some people out there who actually find Mencia * shudder * fun. I stand by my words when I say that I think these people only exist in myth. But if you're really out there, I just ask that you never get into my neighborhood and read these big differences between Carlos and "Chappelle's Show": <br /> 1) Dave was funny. You may want to highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was five times as exciting as Mencia could ever hope to be. But every time a promo for his little show flows, it's about him, tooting his own horn about how he's something we've ever seen before. You got it right, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle didn't have to tell people he was edgy and fun. We are all just talking about to see the show to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had race jokes that dive into the depths of the different cultures - things that some people didn't know about. Like his "I know black people" game segment. The big prize was some hair cream that black people use. It is deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive. So how dare he call himself edgy? If Mencia wrote this sketch, the big prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid. And my accusations have some profit. I saw a promo for his show (which I have affectionately come to call "My TV screen with fifty minutes") a few days ago, and it was some stereotypical Olympic sketches that I admitted to myself were a beautiful fun concept. Then I saw that the Mexican who won got a green card as a big prize. That is it?! It's as close to the fire as you want? Who couldn't think of it - back in 7th grade? For your fans of the show, if you ever watch, and you miss one of his punchlines - perhaps because you and your friends discussed how "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and in no way is that part of the joke where any fun would have something wise to say - just remember there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway: green card, tacos, border jumpers, mowers, and of course duh-de-major. Just remember - whatever it was, it was screaming. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4) Kind of related to second. Whenever he says something that is laughing, he will pause to tell people (while laughing in his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with the last". Don't look it for God's sake. Or let the people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central continue to push this triptone down in my throat that he is this narrative-the-like-it-show that is more controversial than the "Da Vinci Code". You are not. You will never be. <br /> <br /> I've never been offended by the show's content. I would never give it that much credit. I'm offended that Carlos Mencia gets 30 minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yes ... I'm literally offended by that fact.
