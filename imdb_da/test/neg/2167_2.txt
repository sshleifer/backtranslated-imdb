"Tales from the Crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. But it's okay, I was prepared for all that from my previous Troma experiences. What I was not prepared for is that it is indecent, unfunny and boring. Very little of the true anarchic spirit of films such as "Class of Nuke'em High" has remained intact; instead, we get FINAL speeding (to the point where you start wondering if Lloyd Kaufman goes senile and thinks that adults find high speed so fun fun!) and a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, as in Essentially investing time and money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. Oh yes, there are lots of female nudity in the display, but let's look it out: the average porn movie probably offers a better story, higher production values, more humorous humor and above all more RESPECT for the intended viewer than this cruelty. <br /> <br /> PS: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "How to make your own movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
