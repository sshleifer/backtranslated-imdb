The film tells you to be attentive and conscientious. It also destroys all things the Bible claims to be true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the other was disastrous. It has been called "blasphemy" and that is if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people think of it as a good successor to the Bible. However, the film shows a lot of things and topics that can be interpreted as a cinematic version of "Revelation". Some of us believe that such things should not be abused. A good thing about the movie is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice. The director just seems to forget that some people are already acting solely based on the fact that they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible ... Why try to change it unless you are the devil yourself?
