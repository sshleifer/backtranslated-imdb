A group of cavers with a sad story takes a writer on a "hair" adventure through an unknown cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and successors and film companies trying to make money from a winning combination of movie components, The Cavern has only a relatively different twist on the previous eight hollow films over the last few years and that twist seems to have been taken from an X file. I like to give each movie the benefits of the doubt, but there were too many small annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you headaches, as they seem to constantly confuse which path is up. It is not really for me whether the film was realistic. There are far too much unnecessary PANNICK from presumably experienced cavers, in the last half you say aloud one of two things ?? Oh just stop and concentrate on saving yourself or I hope you all die in the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this movie. A moderate amount of doing and nothing special in the dialog or characters. While you are pretty sure, you know what is happening at the end, explaining all the details for the last five minutes. But I would have had a better sense of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor. It was just not necessary. I suggest you strike out immediately after your suspicions have been confirmed and save yourself the setup for the successor. I have long believed that the film industry should share a changing restaurant industry cash register. You pay for the materials to make the movie before entering, but any profit for the movie comes from the tips you give when you leave the movie. I can't blame what I don't like about this movie on its low budget.
