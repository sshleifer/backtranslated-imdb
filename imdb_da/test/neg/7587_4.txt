I generally do not appreciate easy attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita no horse el Tren" cannot score very high for me. The story is good: a middle-aged but still beautiful woman finds a new love. But the attempt to make this movie a romantic comedy only managed to be somewhat comical at times. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has well demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv), "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra von kant "(qv) and" el embrujo de shanghai "(qv). But the powers that have been over the years gave her a lot of trivial things, for the cinema and for television. Something that could be said about José Coronado: perfectly capable of producing serious performances. María Barranco belongs safely to this grouping. <br/> <br /> In the end, I became convinced that I would be delighted to see a new presentation of this film in a serious tone that would allow actors to truly show off their executive skills. And the curious thing is that it has to be done with exactly the same leading players. Wasted talent on a pretty stupid movie that could have been very promising indeed.
