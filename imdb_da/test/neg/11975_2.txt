Normally, I love to find old (and some not-so-old) westerns I haven't seen to be entertainment for the evening. It's such a good way to sit back, relax and escape politics and the world's problems for a few hours. But that was not the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. Casting and storyline of this series closely follows the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old, fair, revisionist history, where the 'evil' must all be white, male, confederate (in this case) and preferably christian (if it can somehow work into the script). It's sad, really. The best movies out there are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen - not about forwarding a person's political ideology.
