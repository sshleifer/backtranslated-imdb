The writers and creators of this movie should actually be sued ... To pollute the world with this crap! "Man in the Mirror" is actually beyond terrible! Way, way, far beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and I don't just say people because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or because of the fact that this really is one of the most retarded depictions of his life I have ever encountered! <br /> <br /> I'm saying it's a waste of time, money and celluloid! I am ashamed to have only seen it all! It's 1 hour and 26 mins of my life, I never come back! I tell you; watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider being warned!
