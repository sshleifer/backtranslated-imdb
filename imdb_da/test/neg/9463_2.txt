I know this movie is a low budget horror movie intended for them for the sake of shock and "cheap" doing, but even considering that this movie is just too boring, filled with a disjointed plot along with horrible music and clear signs that this movie was never finished. <br /> <br /> Without giving any spoilers, I just want to say it at the final coil, things are wrapped with no explant at all, either by movie or narrative. The girl Anitra is really attractive, yet it is not a good reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of these gore movies from the 60s and 70s, then watch it, but be warned that it won't even reach the usual plateau of these kind of movies .
