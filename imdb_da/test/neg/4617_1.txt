One of the scariest movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first!). Now, as with other movies, they have completely destroyed the Carrie franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the movie coincides as geriatics in a beat-van van. There is hardly any scare, and this movie is filled with all the different high school steroids (ie, the football jockey, the bitchy cheer leader, the followers and of course the black nail polish wearing misfits). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what to do the moment you see the opening credits. Well, of course, the girl is humiliated thourghly and then becomes a crazy mental killer ... gab ... <br /> <br /> Been there. Finished it. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem to be forced to make this movie. Emily Bergl is as scary as a cabbage patch doll while Jack London ... let's just say I didn't pay to see the tree act. Apart from the actors, flasbacks earn more to annoy than to connect with the first movie. Bottom line If you can beam objects around like Carrie, then for God's love radiate you out of that theater ......
