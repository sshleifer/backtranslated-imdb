Primarily. I've seen better plays and more realistic makeup in porn flip. Where did "Chris Moltisante" call Stewie Ungar? On the soprano, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief. And then throw "Bobby Baccala" as one of his Vegas cronies. It's just too much to take a dramatic movie. Neither actor can play a serious role and is better suited to another banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who made makeup for this disaster? I want the person to be my make-up person over the next 25 years, so I will never anyway one day. So that's all I want to write on this movie, as it's not worth wasting too much of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
