I am offended and angry at the idea that a successor to 'Gone with the Wind' should ever have been completed. Having expressed it, I have no problem with the quality of the actor or actors in this movie. The performing artists are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of waste. Hype around this book and movie just happens to be an exercise in futility. I think it will go down like one of the wrong movies in Hollywood. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been soiled by another writer's ideas and interpretations. The film and the book must be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and filmmaking. The sad thing is that people actually made money out of this tripe.
