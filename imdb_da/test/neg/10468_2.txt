Except for the fine rack on Clara Evans ... this was pretty bad ... so why did I see it? Too much coffee and had to relax before you hit the bag. Seeing BB change in his loudest Big Chief outfit was, at best, entertaining, quite ridiculous at worst. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better Skeltor and special effects on my Dell. <br /> <br /> Boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and he looks more and more like Scarecrow from his television series days back in the early 1980s .... the women's Eyes must go back to acting, though Evans size 40 and playing a 17 year old (she is in her early 20s was a stretch) .... The Sci-Fi Channel has done better that this ... but for us people, that doesn't come out to the pillars much more, i think we have to take what we can get ... after all that gets you away form CNN, MSNBC and Fox coverage of Elections 2008 this day is a good thing.
