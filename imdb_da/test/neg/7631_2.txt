With so many good films released in 1995 (especially "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately there had to be some bombs, and this film actually falls into the latter category with a dull, predictable plot and a miserable ending. It seems that Antonio Banderas has not been able to find a proper script since "Desperado", the only remarkable movie he has finished. Anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who DeMornay's stalker was from the beginning. Her flashbacks of her mother's death did nothing but confusing an already paper-thin story. Too bad Dennis Miller was wasted in this movie; This part resembles his honestly similar role in "The Net." <br /> <br /> The intricate end had me shaking my head, which I pretty much did throughout the movie. Plus, any movie depicting animal cruelty in any form or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets my thumb away. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid this at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2.10
