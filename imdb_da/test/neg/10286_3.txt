If you find the portrayal of violent murders and lack of police brutality expressed in a plot smaller movie with glacial pacing entertaining, then you need to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both mind and spirit. The notion that this is a "thriller" is comical; It would involve some kind of tension and twist. You continued to wait for the story to actually finish the "start". It never rises over a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all the violence of "No country for old men" without any kind of hunting or sympathetic characters. Thrill-killers run amok. The action is good, for the most part, but the script is a pile. Don't disturb and tell your friends not to bother.
