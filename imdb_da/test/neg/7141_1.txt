Okay, first the good thing: If you saw the trailer, you know about 100% of the movie's "scary / jumped" moment. And yes it is a good thing because you just have to stick to the trailer and not watch the movie. I now understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar didn't live much in that movie for a very long time, she didn't want to associate her name with this production. I wish her the best for "The Return". You must follow 3 different stories in this movie and they are all interrupted (in time and meaning) until the end. And even then it is a very bad climax. And God forbid to open the door to another successor. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, "The Rage and Fury" is on the move. You don't have to visit the house anymore, just be close to someone, when inside and you're done. It's no longer a curse, it's a bit like a virus. Enter the house, be frightened, return to the United States and spread the joy of your apartment complex. <br /> <br /> It's not that hard to follow, but you just don't care about anyone. The baseline is slim to none and you have many scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk anyone ?? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia Film Festival last summer, another story quite, but much better than this dud. It's not a remake, but this time, maybe they should just have remake. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, wait for the DVD.
