I was sick one day and dusk channels and I came upon this horrible ranks. The reason and even the subplots (if you can find one) have been carried out for extinction. BUT, just as bad as the story was, I make a special comment on Liza Minelli. Her character was definitely one of the most annoying characters I've ever had the unfortunate view of movies. Her only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in everything she's done (or half-finished). Maybe she did exactly what the script suggested or maybe (groan!), That is the limit she has for her acting. Somehow they should have rewritten and killed her in the first 30 seconds of the movie (eg, as the girl who fell from the balcony into lethal weapons (I) (but at least she had fine breasts)) <br /> <br /> Most mood Posted ...
