First, this movie leaves you in a limbo mood. You don't know what to feel. So much so that you don't feel bad for Caines character when his son is murdered (which was actually due to poor editing). The script was too boring. None of the situations matter when you see them. The soundtrack, or lack thereof (if it was not good enough to even remember) does not help it a bit. Only good surprise for this movie was Andy Serkis' performance. It was on par, if not better than Caine's. The story would probably have been better if Serkis would have killed him. To be honest, you do not feel any kind of redemption in climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling if you feel like it. Basically, this film lacks massive drag. Leaves the audience alienated throughout the case.
