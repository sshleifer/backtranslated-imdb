How is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? Were they forced into it? The reason has nothing to do with an idea of ​​how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president. They don't even try to give an impression. Just as you thought you saw a comment from the famous liberals on DC politics (the first five minutes), the film runs from the road and into the B-movie drama of 1) a computer voicemail, 2) the regular evil corporate suits who want to cover it with the most unoriginal lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely beautiful female programmer trying to tell the upcoming president about this. She will soon be the victim of the evil X-files masters of the computer company, who - instead of killing her - her to make her seem untrustworthy. But when she comes to DC, she doesn't tell him. In fact, the movie from B-movie changes drama to idiotic B-movie love drama. So far we are so far away from the movie's original starting point that most people turn it off. I almost did. If it could just have been INTELLIGENT love drama, but no! It is not! That's the kind of "oops I'm so nervous, I'm always stupid all the time, so please love me for that" child of love drama. All with a slow, slow pace that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie, the movie's X files plot or the movie's comedy plot. All plots fail at all levels, as any annoying little pointless dialogue reminds you. The love part must be the result of deciding during a drinking "hi, there must be a dynamic of love between the presidential candidate and the extremely beautiful female programmer, yes it will work! Stick it in there!" In the meantime, Lewis Black is castrated and put in a role where he doesn't come up with a single Lewis Black line. Lewis Black's remorse is replaced by a hope that it will surface once in the movie as it never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart problems, to duplicate the dramatic effect of heart attack by the president's closest aid in Westwing. Watching Christopher Walken become neutered as Lewis Black in roles who are constantly struggling uphill to sound casual and Westwing-ish, but fail like the Titanic every time, is like watching a big blue whale die on a beach. Heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And then enter the low point of the entire movie: It raises the extremely difficult, difficult ethical issues: Should Robin Williams continue to be president, knowing he was elected because of a computer error? The American dream and everything is good when he beats the presidency on live TV, just as Lassie the dog would. With the usual patriotic glamor of the presidency and the so clever-to-we-do history atmosphere that Westwing cultivated in disease abundance for the next million years. <br /> <br /> Director and screenwriter Barry Levinson is now on my personal list of writers and directors, I stay away from forever. This film should be seen as a symptom of a defective production process, where people (including Barry Levinson) should use production money because of their personal circumstances and not their skills. This is a project made to satisfy poorly-qualified people's desire for career success, and the aforementioned great actors were deceived to participate in it. That's the only explanation that can be. <br /> <br /> PS: The voting error in the computer was due to the double letters of Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course, that was what it might be when you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dishwasher.
