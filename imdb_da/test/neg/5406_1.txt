When I write this, there are no user reviews yet, but there are 17 votes with an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I didn't notice anything, and although I did, I don't think I could have stopped scrolling my eyes long enough to appreciate them. A common debate among the movie buffs is whether there are major errors in science, police tactics and the like, so common in B-movies, should significantly degrade from one's enjoyment. I tend to fall into the camp "Yes, it's a fair response" - especially when the errors are central to the plot. With this movie, I look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. They completely clean all aspects of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense and human behavior (outside of B movies, that is.) In short, I cannot think of any non-trivial things they got right. <br /> <br /> Any movie would have its work cut off when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to any weapon capable of disappearing into another dimension on will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a major explosion. (They don't make ghosts as they used to.) Combine this premise with every detail that's wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.
