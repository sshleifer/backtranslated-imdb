The army's private Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapezoidal antenna, comes under fire to make bold stunts without a net and alienate his high heights cohorts; Meanwhile, there is a comprehensive "camp show" to be used for army soldiers and staff, and the entire study of M-G-M has been shown to be fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (unctuously) that introduces actions like Kay Kyser and his orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and M-G-M Dancing Girls (who seem to be dressed as vegetables). Red Skelton makes a sweet piece with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the artists and the alleged live audience (they are very quiet until the editor cuts them to excessive reaction images). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a spring night at Carnegie Hall (unlikely to be accompanied by the classic pianist Jos√© Iturbi, whom Judy calls 'hep'). Production is blank, but manic energy feels fake, fabricated. ** from ****
