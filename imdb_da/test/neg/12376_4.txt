I watched this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember the scariest scene was the big bird that ate men hanging helplessly from parachutes just out of the air. Fear. Fear. As a young child who goes to these cheesy B movies on Saturday afternoons, I was still tired of the formula for these monster-type movies, which usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who could be the daughter of a professor and a happy solution, when the monster eventually died. I didn't care about the romantic angle of a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor. But about a year later I saw Psycho when it came out, and I loved that star Janet Leigh was bumped out early in the movie. I sat and noticed that time. As writers tell the story, it makes it as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.
