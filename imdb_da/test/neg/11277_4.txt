A former IMDb reviewer has stated that 'Rafter Romance' is a "rip-off" (that is, the second reviewer's expression) of a German musical called 'Me For Day, You By Night'. Apparently, the reviewer is unaware that * both * of these films have borrowed their premise from 'Box and Cox', an English game written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This game deals with two craftsmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous hostess. every man believes himself as the only tenant. Because the two men have different work plans, the ruse is not found immediately. This game was once so popular in the UK that "for Box and Cox it" became a common concept for an event where two people willingly shared accommodation intended for only one person. <br /> <br /> The innovation of 'Rafter Romance' (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance. As is common in these cornball films, the guy and the madman strike each other until they fall into each other's arms. Hoo boy. <br /> <br /> The homeowner of this movie is played by George Sidney, a character actor who specializes in playing Jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic. George Sidney was never as annoying as the evil Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but Sidy's portrayal of Jewish characters is still exaggerated and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> For me, the most remarkable thing about 'Rafter Romance' is that this is the earliest Hollywood movie that refers to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At some point in this film, the landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenage son Julius, who is involved in whitening swastikas on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly believed to be Jewish. Certainly no one in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of ​​what Hitler was planning for the Jews in Europe ... it is still surprising to see a movie showing a Jewish teenager who believes swastikas are a joke. His father is indeed angry with this view of the Nazi symbol. A very shameful aspect of the Hollywood story is the proven fact that all major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich as late as 1939. Hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as "Aryan" so their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood's leading men were documented as "Aryan and uncircumcised". Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all of the Hollywood study leaders who collided with this policy were Jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I am surprised that 'Rafter Romance' contains a scene that depicts swastikas unfavorable as this order would have reproduced the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Perhaps the scene was carved into German publishing: it is not essential for the movie's plot.) Apart from this, the film contains nothing remarkable. Robert Benchley makes his usual unfunny befuddled characterization: I never understood this apple's appeal. I rate 'Rafter Romance' 4 out of 10.
