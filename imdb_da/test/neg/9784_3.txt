My jaw fell so many times and looked at this flick, I have bruises. Okay, well, I really don't expect the quality of the others, even the thirteen ghosts (the new one, who was just horrible and still head and shoulders above this insanity). Someone noticed the thin characters ... I wouldn't call them "thin". "Thin" means there may be something for them. What about almost non-existent? In no particular order do we have: The Girl Who Will Scream; The American who wants to see everything out; Macho Guy Who Will Just Bull Through All Until He Gets Killed: The Wise Black Man Who Will Die Early; The extra guy who is there to die first; The extra woman who is there to play hard. That is it. It's your character list, and that's what they are and what they remain from start to finish. If they were "thin," they could at least change a little from the beginning to the end. But they don't. Well, okay, the American guy decides he'll stay with the field work at the end and the Screaming Girl goes back to where she came from. That is the change. Apart from that, they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely reject any real emotions when they finally face the threat. Now the producers get props for an original threat, I would say. I had understood that the story was to be "tremor" but with ants instead of giant worms. I give the author credit: these are very cool, very scary ants, and what they do with bones is excellent. (The first time, "bone snatcher" appears, I admit that I jumped a few feet.) Unfortunately, the very cool concept of Alien in the desert becomes very fast. We get a lot of comments on ants that may or may not be true, but we do not get much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we get all the monster movie clichés ever made. People go into places they know they should not and when they have no compelling reason for it. Moronic signs try to prevent our heroes and die for it. A sign forces itself as "a scientist who does not want to kill the monster but study it". A very nice gadget is introduced only so that Americans can tell everyone something about ants that I give hope that everyone knows it anyway. So the gadget is broken. Our heroes run out of one thing that can threaten the bay. And then there is the last, annoying moment when we know that the threat is still with us - and wonder exactly what and how the hero hero or heroine came to it. It does everything that went before, as useless and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for the cold use of ants and bones. Nothing for clichés, clunky dialogue and dim bulb characters.
