This movie looked like it was shot with a videophone, it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The film never really came together or made much sense, and for a movie like this, of course, there were some unnecessary boots. Of course, the director tried to make the film subjective and different, but it never gave enough information about what was really happening, even in the end, I was left with a mix of anger and confusion. Confusion from the lack of plot and anger because I wanted my two dollars back from the blockbuster and a 1.5 hours of my life back. They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
