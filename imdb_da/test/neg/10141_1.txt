this is really an "okay" series .. everyone in it is pretty good. but I just can't take Reba. she's trying to be fun, but she's just not, and then she got a stupid accent !! If they took her out of the show, I would love to see it every day. <br /> <br /> I've seen the show in 10 minutes now, and as I said before, the Reba spoils the show. however, the 20 year old guy (does not know his name) but he is sooo fun and he really saves everything .. <br /> <br /> Here's the recipe to get a good show. kick Reba off it and star in the 20 year old guy. I really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick Reba off the show and star another
