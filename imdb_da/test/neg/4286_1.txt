The blame for this horrible flick lies with the director, Martin Campbell. Having seen a few of his credits in recent years, this must have been one of his first directors. He had a more than decent cast to work with, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that had no meaning at all. Where was his head ............... was he on drugs? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short shooting calendar, and Campbell was just going to "bang it". I can't imagine that the story that Campbell directed himself came close to the story the author wrote. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, should have slipped under their chairs if they went to the screening. As a poster pointed out, Karen Young made a pretty good match scene with Bacon. She really let 'loosen'. It's unfortunate that I have to fill more space just to stay within the guidelines of what IMDb requires, because I really have nothing more to say about this uninspiring movie. One does not have to be forced to be a "windbag" when criticizing a terrible flick and want IMDb to change the amount of words to fill a criticism.
