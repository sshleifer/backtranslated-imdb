This is not a good movie of a standard. It is very poorly written and the play is just over par (some performances are far below par, but Swayze and Gray do a very good job with a little to work with). What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were choreographed very well, and as mentioned above, Swayze and Gray were high points. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> Scripture. The "bad" guys were simply too bad to be credible. The best villains are those who are not so obviously evil. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say nothing that would let me believe they could be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I certainly won't see a movie about it). <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first where Gray and Swayze meet, when the employees of the resort "dances". Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to enjoy themselves. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile to her. Why? What happened in between to make him suffer from her, so when they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (I slipped at the end when Swayze muttered the line "No one puts baby in the corner." How has he ever done it with a straight face.) <br /> Another thing wrong, the setting of the 1960s. Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980s! Who was responsible for costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> The music (original music for the movie) was ridiculous (with the exception of "I had my life time", which was a good song). <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but FINALLY the most overrated
