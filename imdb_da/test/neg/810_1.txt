If I could give this movie a negative review I would. The mood is the cruelest I have ever seen in a movie. Terrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered greatly without their own fault. There are 2 plots, none of which support half of a movie. Where's the "depth" others see in this movie? That no good deed becomes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The movie starts well and the black and white are very mood and well done. The action is very good and convincing witch makes the horrible humor even more horrible. If you think the 3 Stooges are too fine for each other, if you look at the shelling of a kid's victim with a Bowie knife, if you thought "Schindler's List" was fun, then this movie is for you.
