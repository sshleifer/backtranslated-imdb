The movie's script cannot be distinguished from others, especially The Core, another bad movie. It's pretty clear why Luke Perry doesn't get much work, but to see that the beloved Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) resigned like this, just sad. I really can't think of a plot twist that hasn't been seen coming a mile away. It's not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very poor, even by TV standards. The lava flow at the start of the film, which signals the coming global catastrophe, starts things at a very amateur level. And it doesn't get any better from that time.
