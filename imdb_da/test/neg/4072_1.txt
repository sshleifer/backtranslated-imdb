This movie is so bad it's worth seeing. This movie will get viewers within the first 10 minutes. It all began when a bunch of writers came up with the idea that a jetliner was hijacked, and a passenger who could fly a small plane should land the animal. But they know it has been done many times, so to make it different, let's do it very badly! Major Masters has its name pirated from the 80's film "To Live and Die in L.A." from the character played by Willem Dafoe. It saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747. The plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic front bolt at the top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who regretted this point when they Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the eighties. But when the plane starts, it is clear that a 747 looks a bit more like a 767. This well-researched movie also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfortable room bays. No need for an aircraft engineer at this complex level! Heroine is played by persistent pouting Gloria Lynn Berg. Having carpeted the hijacker despite several bus loads of people on this jumbo jet, has no trouble seeing the guy who nearly killed them all. He just has to entertain. <br /> <br /> The curled aircraft that leaks fuel from all the hijackers will not make it back to Hawaii, so the Masters will attempt to land on an air force base located on an island. Only the track is 300 meters too short! Four army guys with small Bobcats (the kind you rent for the whole day moving a lot of horse manure on the back of your barn) will clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long forest through the jungle in 20 minutes! There's no need for a bulldozer here! Where can you find guys like this? These guys could make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck! After it's hellish obstacle directed, Masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away. Hijacker giggles to itself and without supervision gets free to do more problems. He's finally subdued in a most retarded way that I can't tell you. But can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many retarded scenes in this movie. The wounded captain is parked inclined to the bar on the plane, while the Masters, who apparently can hardly fly, set the plane in 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops. The pilot must be French kissing the attic during these challenging stunts, but do not jump an inch. <br /> <br /> I think if they had chosen different players to play the parts, this movement could have been much better. If we need a pouting heroine in the movie, why not choose the better-known actress Bernadette Peters, who also seems to be persistent pouting? In addition, she can sing, and the busty affluent Peters could include some free splits. Now with the song angle it can be a hijacking, let's land the movie Movie MUSICAL! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as Pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit before the hijacking, and there is no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as gentlemen work their magic on the big bird. In keeping with the musical theme, the Masters can then be played by Andrei Bocelli, whom Peters can sing along when he lands the plane. Not only is he completely blind, but knows only a few English words. Now it's a plot! Think of the edge of your side conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and Air Traffic Controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please butter back to 180, flaps set to 25 degrees. Maintain 230 headline" <br / > Bocelli: "What?" ATC: "Sir, arm spoilers now, confirm brake pressure at 250 psi. Maintain pedigree at 500 fpm" <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" The captain could have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield, who can vomit an abundance of one line when he is bound and unguarded: "I don't get any respect. Wife is in group sex. Yes, she screwed me in front of the judge and the jury! "Get the idea? <br /> <br /> DANGEROUS OPPORTUNITIES The movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that never develop. Woody Allen could have been on the back and bidding on one of his neurotic monologues: "She said I was good in bed. I told her I trained a lot ..." Now it's a movie! <br /> <br /> Also, according to a similar movie "Executive Decision", where lazy eye Steven Segal is mercifully killed in the beginning, the movie gives a chance, the 747's massive ceiling is at the top. The plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated for nearly 40 years up there? My uncle has old clothes, a sled, leaves and all sorts of things in his. Wouldn't it have been cool if the Masters opened the trap door and saw a foggy eye on Chevy Chase in a woman's home dress and watched old Super 8 movies from her childhood? Just a recommendation. <br /> <br /> Then give it a try and when you lapse into and out of consciousness, imagine how great this movie could have been if I had my hand in it ...
