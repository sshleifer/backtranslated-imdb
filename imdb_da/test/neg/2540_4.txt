This movie was different from most of the Jimmy Cangey's 1930s movie because it was not made by Warner Brothers / First National, but was a minor study loan. Because it was a "poverty-stricken" studio, the production values ​​are lower than you might normally see with Cagney movies. Plus, the plot is definitely one of the strangest I've seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good guy in this - fighting for the law. This is not so unusual because Cagney often played lawmakers - as an OSS leader (CIA ancestor) by the FBI agent. HOWEVER, to make him become an investigator for the Bureau of Weights and Measures, it was strange - especially since he sometimes seemed pretty much the same as he did in the movie G-MEN! <br /> <br /> All in all, a time pass and it's all about it. Finally, the video tape I watched from Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever encountered. The sound was horrible and scratched and the print so much white and had lots of torn film and holes.
