I just finished reading Forsyth's novel 'Icon'. I thought it was one of the most in-depth, detailed and twisted books I ever read, absolutely in my top 10. I bought a DVD version of the book starring Mr. Swayze. OK, let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel to 2.5 hours, the movie time would be impossible, so I understand the team's reason to swing from the book version and depart. But when I say "deviate" what I really should say is "take the letters from the book, add a couple, let out a couple, pick up the book's plot, add a modern new plot, add Frederick Forsyth's name in there". I'm not saying this was a bad picture far from it, some of the effects were top notch and the play wasn't half bad. The story sucked and did not rely on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and genuine and changed the reality of reality rather than exaggerating it. This could have been so much more if it had taken its time and made a 10-part series. If you haven't read the book, expect a decent movie with a good play, if you've read the book, try to forget it when you see this.
