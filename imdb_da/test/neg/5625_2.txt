What a cruelty. I am not one to demand total verisimilitude from a movie, but the plot and manuscript of "Killing Zoe" is so artificial that I found myself waving through all (mercifully short) ninety minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews will now have figured out the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with the American safecracker Zed, is also a bank employee who Zed will help rob in a high Bastille Day hoist. br /> <br /> The movie derives one's credibility from the get-go. Zed and Zoe's magical night is very prosaic, and Zo's allegations of having experienced the orgasm for a lifetime seem to reflect the writer's long-standing teenage fantasies more than any real screen chemistry. Zed's complete indifference when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel room scarcely sets the stage for their later strong attachment. <br /> <br /> In acts two, Eric's ties of bohemians - drug-abused losers leading a marginal life of crime - preparing their big heist with a night on the town. Here, Roger Avary's main goal seems to be to prove he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread convincingly entails us (by endless repetition) that Eric really is, really happy to see his old friend Zed again. Very happy. Eric's devil-maybe-care, over-the-top flamboyance and devotion to Zed is not even extremely credible - for example, check out his fake bemusement by discovering a dead cat in his apartment complex. The development of the characters that accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthought. Heist is a disaster - understandable as the plan is ridiculous, and the criminals are complete amateurs. This is where Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent. In fact, however, he is just boring than boring. To build the excitement, an additional security guard is stored inside the main screen. This was boring in video games and it is boring now. Zoe is taken in horror during the hoist, but despite our expectation that she will play a crucial role, she is just beautiful. Or more precisely, Avary fails to do anything with her. In the last five minutes she jumps to life, he literally breaks into the hostage situation and saves the grateful, but still disappears Zed from suffering any consequences of his crime. Why does she not mind his involvement in the crime - or why she gives a curse on him - it is impossible to tell. After all, she has not had the chance to see that he is more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> Throughout the dialogue style and false. Much of it is in French. As a mother tongue, I can confirm that it does not call itself distant true. Eric's sugary-sweet discourse, which swiftly alternates with fierce guys, is supposed to be charming and frightening, but is instead just grating. Meanwhile, his scaredy-cat accomplices more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is struck down in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe for ease: As the bank's hostages, we will soon be freed from this miserable trial.
