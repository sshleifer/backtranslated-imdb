Based on the little I've seen of this show, I don't think I'll ever see it again. It is not even extremely credible and honestly the Derek character just makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry but seeing such spoiled brat gets its time again and again? Why would I like to see it?!? No thanks, there are lots of other shows that involve fake characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the evil one does not win or if they do not do as they do themselves. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think it is a horrible picture to paint about living with the place-seekers. Yes life is not rosy, but you could try to portray a sign that was not completely evil and wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you only see this if you like to see the villain win.
