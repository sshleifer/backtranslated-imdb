For a scientifically constructed super dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime, CHOMPS was a chump. All I ever saw Chomps was was sitting or walking or driving. Or run, then go and then set ... and then come up again and stretch, then go, and then jog to K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes it had all the answers to the daily Jumbo. But most of it was just a lot. All I say is: In a Celebrity Death Match, Chomps couldn't take out Mr. Bigglesworth.
