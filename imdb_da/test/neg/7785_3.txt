I hate a movie that has no end. I don't care how good or bad the rest can be, I don't like being left without a conclusion. Such shows should insist on a disclaimer ... something like: The movie you are watching has either no end or is so ambiguous that it is not essential. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene we are left with is Dee and Dominic a bit of a row, and he says, almost apologized I thought it couldn't be him because the fingers were either a girl or a child's. Then it ends! Yes, the smoke gun is in the hands of Dv's son, but what about Dominic's daughter? I actually thought we could find it was her! Anyway, unless you like unfinished movies, then I will avoid this. Otherwise, I thought the movie was generally good.
