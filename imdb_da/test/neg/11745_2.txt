* Some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely is. But this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been much better. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the filmmaker must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What are they thinking about? Unlike the "harmless", almost childish Bates, which Anthony Perkins could imagine, Vaughn looks as if he could be a killer. In an effort to get his Bates to be innocent, Vaughn stops acting gay. Many of the other actors also didn't seem to care for their parts, including Julianne Moore, who just didn't seem to fit into the movie. <br /> <br /> At the top of the terrible casting, the cinematography is extremely shabby, despite the fact that they recreated the scene to stage. The only thing they added was random images of objects such as. Clouds or a naked woman, between shots of characters murdered. These shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot anyway, and in turn made no sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, this psycho-remake, which could be a decent picture, instead of being a complete waste of time.
