Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the first reviews submitted by alleged reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38, all rated this film a 10. In comparison to other great movies, these reviewers felt that Quick and Undead is a better movie than The 6th Sense (8.2), Save Private Ryan (8.4), Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8) just to name a few. Hopefully, these shills will use their next discounted lasik procedure as they hear about because it is quite obvious that these reviews have been forged. <br /> <br /> I was led to believe that this movie highlighted a unique concept in the genre of Zombie film making. Unfortunately, when you look at Quick and Undead, it is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who were either involved in the production or interested in the marketability / economic success of the films. No one cements this in my heart more than hearing that part of this movie was shot in Texas, was randomly assigned to the early posting, the law movie is from. Zombie movie / Horror B movie culture on a whole is a forgiving group, but this movie is unfortunately out of any redemption. The characters are reused and the plot is poor. The film quality was not bad enough to be a branded video camera, and at least they used a movie quality camera. The action is horrible, the star successfully tries to come out as a Clint Eastwood, will be clone. Christ on a bike !!!!!! Even the leading actor's name is Clint. He was just awful. The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood is that the management uses "wood" from Eastwood's name in its style of acting. Zombie makeup was over Halloween party quality but not applied to the full undead cast members. All of the zombies were not made on their hands. The reason was so creepy that I was hoping for a power outage, a spot on the DVD disc, or that the zombies would draw attention to the director. Maybe the movie is worth for some viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. Fortunately, I used my free rental coupon to check out this DVD. Maybe this movie will be rescued by Nott Entertainment (appropriate name), who releases a special collector DVD that will fix the bugs and deliver the promised items ??? Some how, I don't think !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Let's just hope that their next release, The Flesh Keeper really is a "keeper" of a movie .. and not a 5th generation recycled version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Fingers crossed here guys ... but only if you worry.
