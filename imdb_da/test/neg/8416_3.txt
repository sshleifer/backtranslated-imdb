This is a stupid spoof of private eyelashes when a novelist (Michael Cain) is urged to "ghostwrite" an autobiography of a colorful, diminishing Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). At times, sadness becomes unpleasant. This is not Cain at its best. Rooney is way above the top. Remarkable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the comely Nadia Cassini. Not easy to see.
