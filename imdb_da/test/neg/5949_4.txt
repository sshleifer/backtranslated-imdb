Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely beautiful in this app. 1840 "Western". However, it alone does not help a ridiculous story with countless historically wrong elements. Byrl Ives is convincing as the 70-tyrannical patriarch, an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday. His wild dance at a party he gives to his neighbors will get someone to notice it (this guy is SEVETY SIX?). Always mumbling Bible verses, he demands respect as he drives sons and friends away with his self-righteous rantings and emotional atrocities. The love relationship between Perkins and Loren first seems absurd, but becomes credible near the end. There is plenty of drama, but not enough to thrive. Clearly written to the scene, this story was dated even when it was filmed. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not composed until 1882. Critics who beat Sophia Lorens "command of the English language" are rather petty. I found her English flawless and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a separate dialect, which was often referred to as "proper Italian". However, her "accent" does not affect how she speaks English. As a first generation German American, I appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as a second or even third or fourth language. "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in Classic Sense. For my pleasure, a logical story and an overall "pay off" for the time invested was lacking. Fans of the stars will not miss it, others will end up at their own risk!
