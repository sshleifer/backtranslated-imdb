I saw this on cable because I was a great Leelee fan. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. You don't care a bit for any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who is a complete jerk in the movie and steals Josh Hartnet's long-standing boyfriend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this movie would have followed the proven formula and made Hartnett an ass and Leelee as a girlfriend caught in a bad relationship from which she was rescued by Klein. But Hartnett is a really cool guy who shows many feelings and love for Leelee. <br /> <br /> Then you hate leelee because she cheats on Hartnett with Klein, who is a shake for everyone in the city trying to help him and really stuck. <br /> <br /> It's also really campy and the characters do everything but run around the dances and lip synchronization of the kitchen, and using hairbrushes and spoons and fake microphones (though they come very close). <br /> <br /> What a horrible horrible movie. You're not even worried about what's happening in the end, because the instructor never lets you worry about the characters.
