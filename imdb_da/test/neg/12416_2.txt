Probably the greatest thing about Wild Rebels that does the worst is the hero. He has LOSER written over him, but it doesn't stop him from "getting the girl." Probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable, he decides to stop racing when he crashes his car. Well, his new job is still running, as a lot of bike types choose him to drive their escape truck when they commit crimes. There's nothing that really makes you Rod, even the situation he's thrown in is pretty stupid. Finally, on the lighthouse, you want Rod to be killed with all the cyclists. Get this: He's shot twice, once in his arm and once in his leg, and still manages to climb the stairs slightly. If only Jeeter had better goals ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you see the MST3K version.
