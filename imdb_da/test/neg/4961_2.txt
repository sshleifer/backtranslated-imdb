With my two stars I would probably make it the head of the IMDb hated it "list for this seemingly hugely popular TV series. Not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this site, I decided to buy a DVD version of Because I usually find British humor, I am fine, I gave up in the middle of the second installment and, according to other comments, the "funniest" bits have already passed through. that I absolutely lack a sense of humor, but then I had to laugh as crazy as I looked at (and again see) Fawlty Towers, which Black Books is albeit weakly thematically related. Only one generation thing, and yet the differences can be pointed out. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are set in businesses to finance their owners economically. To survive, Fawlty Towers are fun because headache The zones must handle situations that they cannot cope with. The fun is that they make a serious effort to succeed, and while laughing, one also feels sorry for them. Black Books has no situations, it's just there, and the owner passes his time and feels sorry for himself. If a situation threatens to arise, it is quickly pushed away. It is remarkable how fast and how often a subject has fallen, and the protagonists turn to something completely different than producing an extra joke. Tell jokes ?? and not very good - seems to be all Black Books is about. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would have done the job just as well. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookstore because the protagonists of veneer of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance must be sensitive and cultured. They are not some lowbrow gorillas, but bumbling semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they're like you and me. The way in which the series makes this claim is the only way I can explain its success. There is nothing remarkable in the protagonist's actions, what is special about them is their financially unrealistic living conditions that many viewers might envy them for. The main characters who narcissist and stupid convey a sense of belonging and companion seem to be a trademark of the time the first world currently lives in. Recently, I saw Tittybangbang, also a fairly new British television comedy show. I found it incredibly fun. It is often rather tasteless or xenophobic ?? but always with an intention and hits the theft of the theft in his social criticism. Humor is mainly created by situations or by signs with a purpose. The low ratings in IMDb may indicate that this humorous brand does not conform to the times, but I am happy that it still lives and kicks and hopes it will continue to do so.
