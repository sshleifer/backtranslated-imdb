Now I remember what the 'indie' filmmakers ripped off before Pulp Fiction. It was David Lynch, right? <br /> <br /> I chased this thing down to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to see him, such as when a person you love is terribly ill and there is nothing you can do. Almost all the clich√©s in the book: the desert, the psycho, the peculiar mob boss, the cyclist, Tracy Walker (who fortunately was only in a scene, but I was expecting him to come again and say something strange and deep as "If a man wants to know where he should, he must look at where he has been "or any build-up waste like that). I have a theory of why so many Indians are short on the spot in the desert. I think that's because they can save money on lighting. <br /> <br /> If you like being in pain, find this movie and give it a view. If you're a fan of Kyle Secor, see the reruns of Homicide on Court TV. If you want a good, quirky road thriller, check out Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason no one has heard of Delusion! My God, what a waste of a good title.
