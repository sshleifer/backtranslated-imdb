Cameron Mitchell plays an actor dating a young actress who used to dance her head at a movie studio (she is too young for both of them!). At a party, when he lights up his cigarette, the studio manager throws a high alcoholic drink on his face and he gets fire. In the hospital, his face is completely bandaged and he still lights a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor in Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also turns on cigarettes! <br /> <br /> Mitchell regains more or less that he really made burning makeup on one side of his face, resembling gray putty and tape, and an eyelid. When Mitchell does not smoke, he kills people. Now he only kills some times sometimes, as he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a kind of waxy coma. If he does not manage it regularly (and he never seems to remember), they start moving a little again, even if they are in a kind of hypnotic zombie state. However, not all his sculptures are human. He obviously has talent as a sculptor. The ending, which seemed to be hit by a much poorer pressure than the rest of the film, is really absurd. They did not know what to do and went back to the title of an idea. Apart from the oddly-grained final shots, the rest of the movie is in pretty good shape, except for the sound of some scenes that sound like it was being driven through a blown speaker. Absolutely not one of the better wax museum films.
