If movies where virtual reality characters come to life, and they are all, male hard guys or female eyeglasses sound good to you, maybe this movie might not be a total waste of movies. Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute bore, with little actor talent and even less of a script. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
