Remember the horrible war movies your grandmother forced you to see 25 or so years ago on your old VHS recorder? "The Fallen" is just a poorly performed remake of these movies! The story is horrible, the direction is horrible, editing is horrible, the music is horrible, and everyone makes an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also terribly slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while I watched it, but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie! It's so bad! Ten lines are great so I don't know what to say. <br /> <br /> Press the Eject button NOW and you will not regret it!
