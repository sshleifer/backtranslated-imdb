A trio sits at a restaurant table and stares wordlessly in the room. Later, they lean on a railroad and stare over the canal in England. A man works a hoof repeatedly in his garden, only his head and upper body visible on the screen. A man and a woman looking at another man looking at a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts for about an entire minute. Absolutely no information is given that could not be given to us in a quarter of the time. The editor must have been half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a scary shot of the raw vagina of a distinctly dead body. A gorge rises. But then the policeman (Schotte) changes a couple of words with a neighbor couple and begins to notice them, and the case is forgotten for the next half hour, while Schotte and his friends act involuntarily insults with each other and with strangers. Finally, the thread of the case is retrieved but continues slowly, almost effortlessly, according to the stylistic pattern already established. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in movies like this, the shooting takes a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of history, but not here. The houses in the French village are linked to each other in long lines. The house fronts directly on the sidewalk without steps. The fronts show virtually no decoration and are largely inseparable. The flat farmland is featureless. What might have been one of the more interesting episodes - a visit to a stone fort on the coast - drills the trio until they start acting like snots and are asked to leave. <br /> <br /> The action is minimal. No one seems particularly anxious to say anything. No jokes are made. Nothing funny happens. The policeman has a face that is almost as interesting as Randy Quaid. The child, a tall-haired blonde, looks like the kind of shot putter on steroids that the East Germans used to play at the Olympic Games. <br /> <br /> I sat there for over an hour before giving it up. Maybe I'll take it some time again. Unless I have missed something or unless it turns into a horrified Monty Python routine towards the end, I don't think you get much from renting it.
