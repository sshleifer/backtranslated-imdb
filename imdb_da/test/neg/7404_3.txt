I hoped this would be caliber from Das Boot and echo the sharp realism created by the renowned German director Leni RiefenStahl in his documentaries, unfortunately I was monotonously disappointed. The story line is inappropriate and despite credibility. An RAF Air Force is shot down and finds its way to a hospital in Dresden. Anna a nurse whose father runs in the hospital and is engaged to a doctor she works with, falls in love with the air, and they love. Next night at a lavish engagement party, the airman is disguised as a German officer and dances with Anna. Even though it is correct and acted, it is for me the soap opera of the lowest order.
