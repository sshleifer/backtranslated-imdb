Not even Emeril Lagasse cooking can save this inconsistent, overheaded idiotic nonsense, starring emeril lagasse as a food channel chef who, with the help of the crew, trying to make the show better, poor plot and stupid script throw this show down drain, Robert Urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and unfortunately it was his last ever (RIP) <br /> <br /> This is the worst show in 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade. I feel very sorry about Emeril Lagasse for doing this sitcom, he even said it stunk. It is hard to believe that they are the same manufacturers of women's designs that made this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 Star
