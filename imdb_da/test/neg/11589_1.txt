Writer and director Jay Andrews, also Jim Wynorski, earns more of his distinctive shlock with a decent cast, threatened by class-Z computer-generated reptiles in "Komodo vs Cobra", which generically rip-off "Mysterious Island" meets "Jurassic Park "as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable yarn of monsters eating at humanity is the incredibly fake special effects. Cobra and Komodo are hilariously horrible. However, graphic artists do an okay job of integrating monsters with their victims, not that any of these are least credible. It was clear that "Komodo vs Cobra" had a budget so low that almost everything non-human in its appearance was false when everyone came out. This cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island, where the US military performs top-inhibited DNA tests on animals. The result is that giant Komodos and Cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise. When the action is opened, the primary scientist becomes gobbled by a cobra who likes to swim. Then we are introduced to a group of 'Greenpeace' as environmental protesters and journalists. Planet One organizer Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish of "Hellbent") pays charter boat skipper Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare from CBS's "Houston Knights") five grand with the promise of another five grand if he wants to take them to this banned island. Meanwhile, the US military suspects that something is wrong on the island so they send their own team of men who fire the supersized predators. Our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of Wonderland), the daughter of the researcher responsible for this crazy science project, telling them that the military should target the island for destruction. The award battle between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes, who have been consistently worn by monsters, find a helicopter and depart in time before the military pulverizes the island. There is no excitement, excitement or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature function. The best thing about this yawner is the composer Chuck Cirino's orchestra soundtrack; it gives "Komodo vs Cobra" an epic sensation. Normally, Jay Andrews writes and manages tolerable drift, but this is far below his low standards. The sexy women are better at survival than the boys. In a scene, our heroic group condemns a river and we don't see any wet T-shirts. Drat! There is nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this drunk. I think the military guys do too much greeting when they get their heads together to conspire. Let's hope Michael Pare got a good payday out of this waste. The conclusion that one of the researchers takes on the character of a lizard comes strictly as a reflection. It's not that bad, it's good, it's just bad.
