I have only seen the minimum wage episode, but I do not intend to see the others, how can it be? Morgan starts the theater complaining about his terrible situation, living on minimum wage right at the beginning of the episode, and the complainant never stops. Ever. Fortunately for the viewer, his thin girlfriend is as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And then, for the very first time, they go to the cinema and buy bottled water to 2.50 and then go to a restaurant to eat out all the time, of course * drummer * complains of being poor. I don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this. No one should be forced to see this crap.
