Why is it that every time I mention this movie to anyone, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise for it. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist on a twist is considered "genius" by anyone who sees it. Is that really what movie has become? Or is it that sometime someone says "Wow, it's so cool," everyone agrees with them and has no meaning of their own? How this movie has a 7.5 character is a disgrace to the film industry in general. It has also become another movie that "needs" two successors for it, so I have to hear about this awful franchise for some time longer. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie and why it's so bad. The original concept is actually not that bad, as there has not been a good serial killer movie for a while. The writing of this film is horrible as well as the performance. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but it shouldn't change the story or write. The actors couldn't be worse in their attempts to scare us this murderer or just scared this movie. So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever they are) are wasted because his character is innocent. Why was he even in this movie? What was his whole fight at the end turned out to be useless and misleading to what the audience thinks is happening. This is, of course, the intention of the filmmakers, but could not have been a better way to do this without having us see all this garbage. And then comes the "big" twist (was it the third or fourth?) And the whole audience is shocked and goes out of the theater, as this is a kind of masterpiece. Sure the movie makes people talk about the story and what not, but it wasn't the only flaw in this movie. The direction was trying to be too creative with what it worked with, and the flashback sequences were only used as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and review the movie and you'll soon understand why it's not worth praising it. For a great serial killer movie, check out the Se7 if you haven't. That's what this movie wanted to be. I've got more arguments about this movie than probably others and will continue to argue against it. Please do not support this franchise for not only your fault but my and everyone else's fault too. Hollywood has to find a good horror movie to do, instead of 1,000 remakes, sequels, and shock factor movies (like this). Oh yes, so the line 2 misses really promising: "Oh yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet!! blood, it must mean good right? Give me a break. Sorry everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, flashy direction and bad acting doesn't make a good movie.
