this movie was actually horrible. most of the comic scenes seem stale and trite, and perhaps the funniest scene in the movie has already been given away in examples. The whole premise of the movie is so incredible and ridiculous, it's hard to really get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. It's not just the fact that the movies are so hard to swallow, but that's how they keep forcing it down their throat and expecting you to stumble down and accept it. The plot itself is so low and easy to predict. boy is in some way rejected from any school he applied for (I suppose he completely forgot to attend the college) and decides to set up his own school rejection school. Everything goes well for a while until the validity of his school is in doubt. Nevertheless, the dorky character manages to dare his beautiful neighbor to fall for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is only a skill he possesses. Then the final struggle with the students somehow ties together and fight for school survival. Of course, the protagonist persuades the State Council of Education to allow his school to stay alive with an "inspiring" speech. This movie would have been more fun to see if I was under 16 and still ignorant of all college issues and issues.
