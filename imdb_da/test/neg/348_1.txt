OK, when you read this, I could stop crying. This movie was so horrible that it was quite worrying. The creatures are pretty sweet, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment of the prisoners and their guard after they were marooned on this daffy island. Even when we saw Barbara Bach with her hair, it was no benefit to buy this little piece of poop. She goes on with a whisper I am never used-my voice - before breathing that just doesn't wash when yelling bloody murder. (Hi the leading man was also sweet, but I'm still not assaulted.) This is a cry-in-your-beer ripoff of the good beer Dr. Moreau. The bad Richard Johnson, who was certainly born for better things, is just unhappy bad as the bad guy. I mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten hardly tries to look embarrassed when he comes through his cameo look. In the name of all that is sacred, do not rent this darned bomb.
