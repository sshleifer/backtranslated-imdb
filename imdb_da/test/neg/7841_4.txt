Although predictable and constructed, not a bad movie. It entertaines, which is all Van Damme hopes to do. The ubiquitous "twin" unit is used again (as in a large number of Van Dam's films), but it is not annoying except for long fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth seeing. The action is decent, nothing spectacular for Van Damme, but exciting. I can recommend to Van Damme fans and even to those who aren't, but don't mind an action movie with a good looking leading couple. The Russian Mob is a good concept and current for the day. Obviously, not his best movie, but by no means his worst.
