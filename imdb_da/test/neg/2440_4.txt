Justine can't find the perfect buddy to make her first time the perfect one. With geekwives in tow, she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance. When she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, an explosion arises and the results are left to your imagination. The problem is, how many obvious sex jokes are left? How predictable can these kinds of movies get? Some fun moments here and there, but nothing too scary or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life. If you liked WEIRD SCIENCE or jokes about the 'fish out of water' combined with 'gender identity crisis', then with all those 90 min you can enjoy it.
