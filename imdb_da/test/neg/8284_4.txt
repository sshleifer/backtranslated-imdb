After their star cruisers run after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked killer seeking revenge for the girl's death. From the beginning of this movie it was quite obvious that it would not be very good (at least what genuine quality goes). The 'dramatic' rally at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least credible sporting events I have ever seen in a movie. It seems that the winner of the race has never run before throughout his life. Not just running tracks. . . but ran at all. Ever. Then we get a terribly unrealistic female navy member who beat several looks with his jewelry and makeup, not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose on her collar while in uniform. Ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically made gore effects and plays that ranged from scary over-the-top to boring under done (all in one actor, remember you) all help to make this movie one of the most unintended hilarious horror movies ever made. On the other hand, the writing was not that terrible, and the story was actually okay. But the direction was horrible, getting worse with offensive poor filmography. The play varied from acceptable to simply abysmal. However, whatever the embarrassingly bad elements, there is something here, whether it is cheese or something else that I cannot figure out, which makes the film very pleasant and worth a look. Maybe it was just Vanna White. Compulsory Slasher Elements: <br /> - Violence / Gore: Death scenes were fun enough, but gore was just awful: blood spikes from impossible angles, no real gashes or wounds from knives, etc. But this movie has the first "death" by football "scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was a little nudity I think Linnea Quigley is in it, and some too high high school students, but nothing too much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): If you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits and fence masks are cool, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: Not really anyone at all. There is a moment that takes place in the girls' wardrobe, which I prepared to be afraid of. . . but it just led to a typical stupidity and was ruined for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: A little, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes in the movie, I'm not so sure about your deductions. <br /> <br /> - Creepy dance scene: There is a fantastic improvised jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and accordion leading to some amazing 80s bopping. This is soon followed by a kind of strange mix of 70's disco and 80's break dancing, which was probably the shameful part of the movie. Final judgment: 4/10. Don't take it too seriously and you like it (like most other things Troma touches). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
