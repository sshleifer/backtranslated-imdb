I watched the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the play and interpretation are heavily contaminated by the television-generated tendency to speak in a strongly subdued voice, not moving lips, tensions, as evidenced by "It's Real Life" productions and "Let's raise -our audience-with-a-few-tears "-screen playwriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers on the other characters of intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The film has some good hints, but (as in another comment before mine), it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many lesser and less relevant plots, another trend dragged in from television production, well-known to the Italians. A few drops in style could be spared the public, such as confectionery (Charm and aesthetics with cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and Fairies are certainly more truthful, think Ozpetek has learned the tune in Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ... I give him a last chance though ...
