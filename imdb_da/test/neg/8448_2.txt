This is just one of the movies that cannot justify much of everything that happens. These people go for a walk: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There is really no Piranhas, but I think the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. Still, there are plenty of animals and there is plenty of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where it goes. Towards the end, there is plenty of action and rape thrown in. Someone has to pay and they do. It would have been great to have a few piranhas fill out things. There were many monkeys. If you jump forward through the boring parts, you have a tight little five minutes.
