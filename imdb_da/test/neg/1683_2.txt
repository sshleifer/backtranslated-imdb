I jumped for joy to finish this show. This shows signs were extremely annoying. None of them had a singing quality. Damon Wayans is probably the most stable. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She is as annoying as she was in Martin. <br /> <br /> The kids are also very annoying. The oldest is an idiot, the oldest girl is stuck abruptly, and the youngest is frustrating to listen to. <br /> <br /> I guess I looked like the intelligent little boy. But it's about it. <br /> <br /> It made the world an advantage by quitting. Let's ask that a Wayan never stars in another show ... EVER.
