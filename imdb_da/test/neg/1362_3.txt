This film is filled with pseudo deep consideration and it is cloying in its writer-ness that includes a can of ham transfer and incredible dialogue. Dialogue that is tinny and tone deaf, which Spike sometimes (not always) is when writing "specific" characters. For those who like nonsense films like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another one for you. <br /> <br /> It is said that this comment is not against Ryan Gosling, who has shown his amazing chops in The Believer. A movie that shows that movies are a director's medium, and when a movie is rotten, it is fair to say that the error is there and not in the actors.
