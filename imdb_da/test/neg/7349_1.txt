I've seen this show for a while, just because of my cousins, and I hate it! First, the girls dress in the same style of clothing and they have the same first letter in their names. (Come on, I could do better than that!) So the bad guys (save me), first we have a monkey with some of his (little) brain showing, then we have a (homosexual) version of the devil, a pink hillbilly , a gang of green gangs (whit is ironic, it's their name) a spoiled princess (again ironic, it's 'her' name) among others. I also found out that there is no male hero in the show. (Not that I'm sexist or anything ...) I'd rather see Sailor Moon, it's much better than this. If someone else wants to see the show in the room you are in, find a way to break the television. Believe me, it will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I give this just what it deserves, a 1 in 10. Whatever you do, DO NOT SEE THIS!
