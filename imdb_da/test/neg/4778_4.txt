As I watched 6.0 on IMDb, I was pretty impressed and excited to watch this movie, as 6 for a horror movie should be quite entertaining. First, I thought it would be some disturbing, unseen evil forces (who hadn't read the book) to scare the audience - but it turns out to be quite common - killer plants. Whether I'm a pretty open person when it comes to movies, I thought maybe the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spider on carnivorous vines. Unfortunately, it was not possible to meet my expectations because of the large amounts of cliché and lack of originality. To top it off, the female main character continues to annoy you with her stupidity. Unless the movie is intentionally a bad B-rated movie entertaining in the annoyance of evil, no movie ever has to annoy you if you expect the audience to worry about the character. Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. The signs were undeveloped, the monsters (plants in this case) left inexplicable, and the clichés dripped all the way. The only thing that is mildly effective is some of the bloody / gory scenes, though gore pales compared to films like High Spension or Ichi The Killer. Consistently unsuccessful logic (for example, why would a sign not see the top of a rope during another attempt to fall into the ruins as it just talked and almost killed someone), even though it was smaller, adding and continuing to angry audience. The movie could have saved itself by using characters or some sort of story unit to tell or "solve" idiot artists who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret their own mistakes). But to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly get the audience to give up all the care for the character and again take away the guilt of terror. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a badly made movie. An example of a well-documented movie involving pretty twenty things being killed is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (and also the prequel) that surely native fears and had much smaller sign logic errors. In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, see it if there is nothing else. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-pair flick and see something actually scary and extremely satisfying as The Hills Have Eyes remake.
