I was really disappointed with this movie. I had heard some good reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters. As a result, I was very excited to see it when it came to DVD. I thought it would be a full-blown horror movie with many frightening surprises, but instead it was a snazzy predictable movie. It dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties these people went through to try to escape, the ending was quite frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for a reason. This is not your typical horror movie with a central bad guy who kills a lot of people. The story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who see many horrible movies. Although I don't like this movie, I recommend that all horror fans see it at least once. You may be surprised by it. With regard to this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there is no sequel to this forgettable movie.
