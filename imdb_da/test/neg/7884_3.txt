A movie about a French girl being raped by street hoodlums. The rape scene itself is shot in all its ugly details with all male and female bodies and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In an angry attack, the victim takes his friend's (or was it brother?) Gun, shoots him and runs off with the weapon. She meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot down, they go together and head for Paris. A number of crazy, meaningless and wild killings follow, the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before. A poor guy is shot in the **** hole. There are good doses of sex thrown between the many kills. The movie is not the most violent I've seen, I'd say saving private Ryan probably had more violence in it. If violence is what you are looking for, then there are lots of other movies out there. And if it's sex you're out for, then I suggest one of the XXX. <br /> <br /> I went to watch the movie because of all the hype the media gave it. The movie itself is not even just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a handheld camera. I was surprised that this film had an age limit of 15 years in Sweden. If 15 year olds can watch this movie, they should also be able to watch XXX movies.
