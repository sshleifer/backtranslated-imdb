This four hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary, mainly because the filmmakers didn't seem to have a clear idea of ​​how to customize a novel for the screen. They did not know what to keep in and what could probably be omitted. The film opens with Sir Walter reading from the Peerage book, which is his primary comfort in his problems. This introduces the family - all we learn intimately over the next four hours anyway - but serves a little different purpose. Likewise, the scenes where the mouse grooves apologize for "poor Richard" serve no purpose, but to drag down the story. Some of Austen's actual dialogue is allocated to different characters, and some of her story is reused as a dialogue that falls awkwardly from the characters' tongue. There is also a fill-in dialogue and it is uniformly terrible. The scene where Charles Hayter is boring Henrietta with his concerns about getting Dr. Shirley's curacy was just as interesting as a story in the book; as a scene in this production it is stultifying. The scene at Cobb when Louisa falls and is "busy lifeless!" Is absolutely urgent and I wondered if Wentworth's line "Is there no one to help me?" may have been aimed at the authors as well as the other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often looks and feels like a body that has been filmed, rather than a real movie, and is most evident in trades, which is the opposite of subtle: thriving delivery of lines, exaggerated movements and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces when they do not speak their lines. Charles Musgrove stands in his salon, feet shoulder width apart, and seems to project to the balcony (if there was one) when he spoke to the other people in the room with him. Louisa Musgrove's face seems to be in confused rest when it does not actively or giggle actively. Louisa is a giddy, giggly, ditzy creature, and I didn't think for a moment that Wentworth would be interested in her. The costumes are a mixed mass, but mostly awful, and Anne Elliot's green tartan dress is possibly the most frightening alleged period costume ever conceived. We get the dates at the start of the show - it's the end of the 1790s or maybe very early in the 1800s - yet many of the costumes seem to be of Victorian design and thus about 60 years early! The hair is just so wrong that I won't even mention it here. Except saying I won't mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> However, this production does some things right. Mrs Smith has given her the right meaning, and her story with Mr Elliot, his dissemination and his intrigue is fully addressed. I was also pleased to see the smooth "reconciliation" scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end, which are a valuable reward for the reader, but became glossy in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you love the Book of Persuasion and just as vaguely as the 1995 film, do not waste a moment (or an ear) on this production; You will find the very will.
