This will be my first review on IMDb, and I'm glad the default value is 1 in 10 because I don't have to change anything ... First, there are horrible movies. Movies you can make a laugh out of, like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. That is perfectly acceptable. They make a good party enhancer. Then there's the worst movie ever. I can't believe how totally crappy this steaming pile of dog animals was. <br /> <br /> I found it on a second-hand VHS store and bought it quickly because I like sci-fi, Terminator, post-apocalypse and things like that. Everything on the box's art was very promising. Then I quickly read the tape when I got home, and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There were maybe 10 minutes (or more) of switching between current clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that make you puke. And it just keeps going over and over again. Then some "plays" jump in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this human abomination actually exists ... And then I realized that there are actually two claims. I didn't think about it first, but the title says "3" in it ... And I was horrified. But when I actually look at the end in great pain and pain, I thought that nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe ... But then showed a little text to say ... "Next ... "and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
