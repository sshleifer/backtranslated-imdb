I really tried to give this movie a try, but when I realized that most of the movie was told by a bunch of boring officials walking around talking on phones, I knew it was over. A lot of this movie also looked like stock footage. It's just lame. <br /> <br /> The camera person continued to make these quick short zooms for no reason! It disturbed me so much, but I just wondered why they thought it was a good idea. It doesn't add anything to a static scene for two people talking. This is not NYPD Blue or any cop show or anything. How could they not have realized that telling this kind of a story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what is not to live? !! Didn't they see this mess? Still, it was just a really boring movie, and it makes it seem like the one who did it, does not understand good storytelling in movies. <br /> <br /> Darn stock footage ... it's just wrong.
