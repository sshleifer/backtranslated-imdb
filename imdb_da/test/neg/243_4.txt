** SPOILERS ** The third and merciful last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series' big star - besides Mummy actor Ramon Gay, as Dr. Eduardo Almada, was shot down by the fierce man for a woman he was having an affair on May 28, 1960! Nevertheless, Gay, who was edited in them from his previous films, did not stop from being in a series of future Mexican horror films made over the next four years after his death. <br /> <br /> In "Robot vs. Aztec Mummy" we have once again sour scientist, Dr. Krupp is trying to get his hands on the mummy's golden chest and bracelets to get them to decipher to find the Aztez treasure that has been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City 500 years ago. "Robot vs. Aztec Mummy" is not much like a movie in itself, as it consists of stock footage of the former Aztec Mummy movies that record over half of the movie's time. <br /> <br /> Having been introduced to the movie's cast members, some of which have been killed in the former Aztec mummy movies, we come down to the real nitty gritty in it involving evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also known as "The Bat". Dr. Krupp - who looks like a wild eye and scary Orson Wells - is a man with limitless visions of grandeur in him, not only uncovering the far lost Aztec treasure, but now he was in contrast to the two previous films he was in, created life and used it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Woods 1955 "Atomic Superman" classic "The Bride of the Monster". <br /> <br /> Couldn't handle the mummy in his other two meetings with the one where he ended up throwing it in a snake pit filled with deadly rattles. Krupp created a robot with a human carcass filled in it for the job to do in the mummy for him. With his mummy sleeping in his grave at a local Mexico City cemetery, Dr. Krupp's robot man stumbled into the mother's crypt to fight it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The great construction of the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation proves to be a major disappointment with the mummy having no problems whatsoever sending "Tin-Man" to less than 30 seconds with his creator Dr. Krupp. All this while both Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate, who came to Mummie's help, have nothing to do but sit back and watch the action. Now without the evil and outside the wall, dr. Creep annoying, mummy can go back to his eternal resting place without worrying about the problems of the modern world such as Dr. Creep that it really is not interested in.
