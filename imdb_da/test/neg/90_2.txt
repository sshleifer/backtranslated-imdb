The only reason this movie doesn't get a 1 (horrible) voice is that the recording of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is amazing. Ida Lupino, who is lovely, usually gets confused as she tries different means to get rid of a madman. Robert Ryan is frightening as the threatening stranger whose character is controlled only by his disturbed mind changes from one minute to the next. Apparently simple and rich, he suddenly becomes smart and threatening. Mrs Lupino's character was in greater danger from the house she lived in and her own stupidity than by someone who came together. She could not get out of her in her own house: the windows did not open, both the front and rear doors locked and locked inside with a key. You couldn't have designed a worse fire trap if you tried. She didn't care to have another key. She also couldn't figure out how to call help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own cellar while she was locked in and out of sight of her prisoner. I do not know which war her husband was killed in, but if it were World War II, the furniture in her house, the styles of clothing, especially the children and the telephone repairman's car, are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see which oddities you can find.
