As you may recall, I think all three of the trilogy of the trash can, and the first movie is the only one that is itself far away from being observable. The second part was low quality wastewater, and this rate is slightly better than two, but still a steaming pile of something I removed from my backyard on Monday. The premise does not make sense, why did the moonshine murder the bad old lady and even in 1921 I think someone would notice a bunch of oily guys, where a cute little old lady once lived. Secondly, this scarecrow is pathetic in relation to where they looked in the first movie. It's just old clothes and a burlap bag. Let's see, the series is garbage and should be forgotten. NAKED!
