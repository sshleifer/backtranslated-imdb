This movie can be seen, but nothing special. Four girls on a road trip to Vegas decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he is cute). They all end up staying overnight in a motel in the middle of heaven, and apparently there are psychological problems with women. The characters are clich√©s - there is a married, responsible woman; a plain party girl; an insecure break to be; and a man-hater who was just dumped. Hitchhiker is really nice until he gets crazy. <br /> <br /> There isn't nearly enough, and too much rape. I like slasher horror / thrillers a lot and this one did nothing to me. The end was just as boring as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the actors did a good job with what they had to work with. The dialogue is not horrible, and overall, I was impressed with the cast and never seen or heard of any of them before. And the plot was not out of the possibilities (although I really doubt any woman today and age would pick up a hitchhiker - no matter how attractive he is), so I was not moaned that things didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hitchhiker" was well-traded and sensible, but was not very interesting. There are many better movies in the same genre that I would recommend over this ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," even "The Hitcher" remake). Do yourself a favor and skip it unless you have no other options.
