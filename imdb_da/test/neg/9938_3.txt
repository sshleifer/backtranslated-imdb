Wow! This is the movie to be shown on television in the morning of Cinemax for all these insomniacs (lord knows they would probably go out of boredom watching this movie) Terrible act, killer is quite far from scary, I've seen clowns at carnivals who were scary. Lots of unnecessary 'skin' in this movie, pseudo-porn scenes that are just awful in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script that really makes the movie, and the director really had no flair for the genre he was trying to low with this movie. I could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this. I don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this movie to anyone ...
