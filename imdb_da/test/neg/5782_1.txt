This movie is absolutely horrible ... Definitely a tyrant *** t story and even worse acting. Surely Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this, as he is a decent actor and has made a couple of great movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are 'A-team' standard with the classic car getting shot and then flipping over with a small fireball under the cap. <br /> <br /> Of course, the enemy portrait as total idiots and dies as fast as they can say "-The evil Americans". <br /> Unless braindead movies are you games, don't spend 113 minutes of your life on this nonsense. Pick up "Platoon" or "Apocalypse Now" instead.
