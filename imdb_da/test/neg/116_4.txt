Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent movie, but I have a few issues with this movie. First of all, I don't like the actors in this movie, but more or less I have a problem with the script. I also understand that this movie was made in the 1930s, and people sought to escape reality, but the manuscript made Ann Sothern's character look faint. She held back and forth between riders and I felt like she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He was really worried about her and her family and would have done something for her, and he finally gave her the boring Neil Hamilton, who, in my opinion, was just out for a good time. Paul Kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and really loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton, while resembling her much, I didn't see the depth of love he had for her character. The production values ​​were large, but the manuscript could have used a little work.
