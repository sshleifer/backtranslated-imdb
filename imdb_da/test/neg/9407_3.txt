I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, pray here to gape and gawk on this wonderful wonderful movie, and just say I thought it stank. The great thing about this site is that you always get a number of views and search them in every way. No one tells you what you want to get out of the movie with. For me, those who saw through the details and their properties got my money. There was one, dead on perfect, pointing to the two great moments of the thing belonging to Pacino. Meeting and airport. Other than that, yes, what a waste of time. Complete. Pacino just does the same again and again, he would have been better served by taking the notion about five notches around the level of his protégé. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Sure everyone could have been. But most of them should never have been done. Including this one.
