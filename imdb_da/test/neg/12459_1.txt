It was so inconsistent - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. It was a poor man (not to mention high school) "Less than zero". I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. So many problems are not solved, and that's okay - but the fact that it is jumping around to the point where you wonder what's going on is terrible. The voice is needed because the movie does not work alone. Avoid this movie and see something else about rich-hearted anxiety. I'm sure there are lots of others to see. Don't waste your time on this.
