And now for another point of view: I didn't like it. I didn't finish that. I know that "Unforgiven" is ranked by some as one of the greatest Westerners ever made. I know it originated and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know it won a bunch of Oscars. Yet I didn't like it. I don't like western, and that is clearly a matter of taste, but I also do not admire Eastwood's play. He is not and has never been a leading man. He's no Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. In this movie alone, he is dwarfed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall man with a reedy voice who usually plays hard guys. Here he plays a retired, hard guy. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his play. Then there is the anti-Western Western plot. It is obviously meant to inject contemporary values ​​- a respect for women's, blacks, native Americans and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drink; the health that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage and small sweet children - for a century where these values ​​were not necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting these values, the film comes across the way if not preach. Then there are hoary movie stereotypes - prostitutes with gold hearts, the child who can't shoot straight, the city slicks new to the wild west, the sage brush shines on a summer dinner with musical accompaniment in big chords. Finally, there is the pacing of Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood still rides north and chats with Morgan Freeman and the child who could not shoot straight, 60 minutes after the plot, driven by a prostitute slash, was launched. It was too slow. Someone had to find these items uncomplicated. I'm afraid it was me.
