I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came across this infantile dung high. <br /> <br /> This anti-Bush propaganda piece masks as a horror movie comes out as an episode of the original Batman made by Michael Moore. Political satire should be clever, but it draws a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of a L. Ron Hubbard movie. <br /> <br /> In its campy, it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason, and treating soldiers and women just as gunfire. It even takes a hint of the Second Change and Religion. All that was lacking was Caesar Romero when the president cheered on how he orchestrated on 9/11. I suppose the end was "we support our troops" moment, but I think they would be more offended than satisfied with the whole effort. I'm sure the Hollywood elites are sitting in their Malbu mansions, patting each other on the back of this "pithy" work, while the misinformed anti-war drones hail it as a genius. <br /> <br /> Time to be equipped with new tinfoil hats kids.
