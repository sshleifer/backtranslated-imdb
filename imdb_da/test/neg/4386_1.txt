This movie was like a collection of people who had been in other movies, and they decided to make a really bad movie. It had a guy from "Detroit Rock City", a girl from "The Cosby Show" who thinks who kissed chicken and bought that the sausage was in "Sorority Boys" and there was more. OK it doesn't make a bad movie in itself, it was just something I noticed. The whole thing with the hooker and the French girl with the same name was stupid and stuff with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they get mixed up ..... shocking enough ....... You called it. And the purse case, it was just stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two parts and made it only for a 50 minute mark. If you see this and expect "Van Wilder" or a movie as such ...... Don't.
