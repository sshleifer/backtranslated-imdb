** Could be considered some mild spoilers, but no more than anyone's review of this movie. ** <br /> <br /> I knew nothing would be like the absolute brilliance of the original "Carrie" who was more of a film about social criticism than it was about putting the gym on fire. Carrie White was "victimized" epitomized, and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel. <br /> <br /> The person who imagined "Rachel" the character of "The Rage" must have completely missed the features of "Carrie." For the audience to really share the victim's anger, he must be a sympathetic character - a sand ejected that is more victim of circumstances than his own vices. Rachel is far too uncomfortable to convey any kind of emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek's "Carrie". And she looks and seems like she should be right next to the "attractive and popular brigade" she ends up throwing. She, like the rest of them, has a soul that is as corrupt as Carrie was completely innocent. It just doesn't work. There is no satisfaction with seeing the beautiful children - not even the "Home Improvement" king - getting started in this movie's climate game. And it's so unnecessary gory! There was no actual bloodshed in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person in particular that this movie should not have been daring to kill ... but I don't want to say who it is. If you've seen the original "Carrie", it's the kind of character that dies unfairly. <br /> <br /> At least, they made the connection to Carrie appropriate; It is explained as it should have been. But that, and the arm tattoo, which was done pretty nicely, is just about the only thing this movie is about to make it. Another horrible "Scream" knock-off and it beats the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I didn't expect much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An unsympathetic character, a series of annoying pop culture references thrown in no good reason, and a closing scene that bleaches in relation to "Carrie "'s headstone shocks.
