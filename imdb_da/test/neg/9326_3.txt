Once again, I have been struck by seemingly intelligent reviews that make seemingly intelligent comments about a blatantly crazy movie. I actually put on my shoes, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental site after reading reviews and paid the required 4 dollars and shifting to renting this thing. I tell you this is not worth minuscule kilo calories used to lift a forefinger to change channels on a remote control. <br /> <br /> I gave it another few minutes after seeing everyone tell the characters of a pedigree dog pile. These are presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is one. goes senile or, b. is only marginally interested in the movie he / she is required to create. I saw similar deterioration with John Carpenter's string of ridiculous caricatures over the last year. <br /> <br /> Here are a few scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest has a disturbing dream ... apparently a harbinger of nastiness to come when he seems hell bent on opening the archaeological function that houses the demon. The dream is a goofy collage of unmatched images straight out of Twilight Zone's stock footage. A ticking watch cares through the sword of dream scape, which means what, the inevitable mystery of Time? .... big deal! A disembodied head, painted in demon features with grocery quality quality Halloween make-up, flickers back and forth in a convulsive frenzy. Every time I see this effect, it's a big fat rip-off from Jacobs Ladder, it pisses me off. This in itself immediately discusses a movie. <br /> <br /> The whole structure of the archaeological dig itself is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and exaggerated ... the only possible answer is boredom. At some point in the grave, the priest states to find statues of angels surrounding a sarcophagus ... they all point to the crypt with their weapons. He asks "Look at these surrounding statues .... It's as if they are holding something .. down!" This is supposed to build excitement ... critical mass .. but it doesn't even come close! How can there be excitement if you treat the audience as a bunch of morons to explain the excitement as you walk together. The images are over-finished at first, but the added comments only add to my disgrace. Shortly after, the grave is "decorated" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless rip-off of The Keep, btw). Who, to cry aloud, did the make-up effects for this movie ??! The blood actually had the pink quality you could see in the 70's Tromaville flicks. At this point, I was almost convinced that they just forgot the makeup and had to go to Wal-Mart for time and money. <br /> <br /> DO NOT listen to glowing comments on this! I also suspect Schrader. It looks like it may be time to hang up on his gloves. Perhaps a close friend will offer a cautious call to quit while still worthy of remembrance of films that have gone.
