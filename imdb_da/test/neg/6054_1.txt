"Embarassing" is the only word that describes this ridiculously horrible production. From the obvious lack of respect for the source material (sure to confuse any distant acquaintance with mythology) to the predictably inadequate production value, this whole mini-series is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Cast (which includes some good actors as I pity) delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic "European" accent so common to bad epics. Worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and set design (blurring styles from time and space) to the score (which apparently mimics many recognizable classic tunes as well as "Lord of the Rings"). The most offensive of all is the visual effects that show individually that if you can't afford to do them well, WRITE THEM OUT. <br /> <br /> It even bothered me to see yet another legendary tale bastardized by a cheap "customization". Maybe someday somebody will do it right.
