Child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive and controversial combination, and so it is my personal belief that any movie showing the courage to revolve around this topic should receive extra attention from horror fans. Of course, as in the case of "Wicked Little Things", controversial themes do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, atmospheric environment and involvement of video-uncomfortable instructor J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), this is an uninspired and cliché-ridden movie that could not give a single scare or shock. After losing their husband and father, the remaining Tunny women (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small and remote Pennsylvania mountain town, where they inherited an ancient ramshackle mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins, where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. Strange things begin to happen as young Emma was in an (imaginary?) Girl who used to live in their house and the scary locals seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. Quickly it turns out that the undead children are still leaving their mingrave at night to seek revenge over my owner's owner Carlton, who was responsible for their death. "Wicked Little Things" is pretty thin and very predictable. The script shamelessly serves a horrible cliché after another, like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times, feature-less lights and terribly broken dolls. There is very little tension, even less gore and the makeup effects are disappointingly weak. The zombized children do not look at all. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. The tension-free finale is stupid and just as distant as the rest of this meaningless production. Lori Heuring is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a great star thanks to "Halloween" remake) and young Chloe Moretz are appropriate as daughters.
