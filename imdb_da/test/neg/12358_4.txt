I caught this movie - titled "What Lies Above" - ​​on Life's movie network last night, and just had to comment on it. Designed as an exciting woman-in-peril, action adventure yarn, it is so unintentional fun (thanks to much of Marc Singer's scenery-chewing hammy performance) that I thought I saw a cross between "Cliffhanger" and "Home Alone 5. " Heroine Nicole Eggert makes her rude, but silly as dirt male persecutors resemble the three stooges succumb to her ridiculous provisional prisons (somehow she manages to devise a swinging frame with ropes and a log in minutes, temporarily takes one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her). Worth looking for a hearty laugh.
