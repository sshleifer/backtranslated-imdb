If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, this is not the case. If you're looking for one of those horrible movies that are so horrible that they're actually good, then it may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this movie that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles that say "Jack-O" and then add the word "Lantern" as if the viewer couldn't find out that the movie was about a pumpkin of the giant pumpkin shown on both covers and in the movie opening scene . Then the film goes in about 20 different directions, none of which makes much sense. Jack-o is everywhere he is in people's houses, in the woods, and yet he never seems to do much of anything. He does a few kills, but the long structure for these kills is so badly acted and constructed that you would almost wish Jack-o would take his anger over you. Apart from that, the plot consists of little action, free naked and a ridiculous line. The action in this movie is among the worst I have ever seen in my 35 plus years of film viewing. The boy leading the movie (the director's son) has about as many feelings as a corpse, and almost all other actors / actresses are just as bad for many reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes larger than plates) . But when you have said all this, if you take it for what it is (it is a steaming pile of fertilizer), you get a few laughs from this movie. What I also found entertaining is that the DVD's makers liked to release a "10th anniversary version" of this movie (as if the original was not good enough). And somebody actually had the idea of ​​making a "behind the scenes" mini movie, which is also included in the 10 year anniversary edition (I'm not sure why) ....... I want to give these 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10. .
