I'm Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some have not gone far enough. <br /> <br /> The movie premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was packed with friends and family. We all clapped. <br /> <br /> Five days later, it was pulled from all screens in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in hearing some of the scene after stage details, which can make the movie even more enjoyable, let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the toilet pressure to distract one of the evil henchmen protecting the radio transmitter at the Buddy's deck house. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon diffused the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> Didn't help. It's still bombed. <br /> <br /> Take it on.
