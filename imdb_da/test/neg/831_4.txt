First of all, let me say I wasted Halloween filmed by watching this waste. Secondly, let me tell you that the current DVD, available from the Shriek Show, is not uncut, so your dear dogs get very sad. Thirdly, one scene is the highlight of the movie, and since it has been cut, you see where I am going. <br /> <br /> I know many scary fans dig this movie. It's atmospheric, shot in the woods with some very beautiful scenes, waterfalls and such. But after the opening kill, which has a very brutal shot of a machete stuck to a hunter's step, you do not get any real brutal killing after that. And with a slasher movie, you want it. At least I do. The director and co. Do nothing new with the killer in the forest tank, several of this type of film were all made just about the same time in the early eighties. All it has to do for it is that you do not hate the actors as much as in other movies. They are kind of sympathetic. The children have a reason to be there: one of them owns a plot for some properties on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no cabin or house, so why buy properties in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or not? Now I'm sure some people buy land for camping purposes, but it just seems unusual. Still, it appears, and the campers start to choke and pick them out one by one. And as I said before, you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after machete kills in the beginning. The end has some kind of killed by Connie, but it's not enough to save this from being almost identical to the completely forgettable movie, The Forest, which is insane. <br /> <br /> If the Shriek Show had been able to get a really creepy print, this review might have been a little more forgiving, but it's the day and age of unknown / unreleased DVD releases of old blurry movies to cine dogs like me. When you let us down, you get the critical review. Unfortunately, the presence of the great paternal George Kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to separate it from the other garden waste that was combed out again on the day.
