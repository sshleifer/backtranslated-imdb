First, what is really good about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great play! There are very few actors I really like, and for now he is one of them. He has a great skill to imitate characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a nine lost in his own world, unable to walk. <br /> <br /> I still only give it a 3 out of 10 for some mistakes: <br /> <br /> - Terrible second part. It seems that the director was very eager to do something new, but despite the effort, it was really boring. <br /> <br /> - Very annoying character Melissa. I couldn't stand the scenes with her - it was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with American woman. <br /> <br /> - Awful explanation of the numbers. The director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point with a good story .. sorry excuse koalas? brr ... horrible! <br /> <br /> This movie had great potential. The movie is nicely finished, the music is really good, but nothing more. Just watch it if you're a fan of Ryan Reynolds, or have a lot of time to save.
