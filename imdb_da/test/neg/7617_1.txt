I've been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the beginning. The most seductive thing about them was the love and innocence and companionship shown. Kermit was a role model for deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, yet sweet and trustworthy. All the other characters were a little eccentric, but it showed how different kinds of creatures can coexist carefully and respect each other's difference. The following films have had the same vibe. But this "It is a very good Muppet Christmas Movie" would have Jim Henson spinning in his grave. These characters have been completely rewritten to be horny, uncomfortable, selfish and cheesy. <br /> <br /> The cast continues to portray God as a creepy corporate head, with an average stripe. Angels like spineless, non-spiritual corporate staff, and the movie was so bad I had to stop watching. I had bought it for my nephew, but fortunately I am immersing everything I give to a child. <br /> <br /> This movie deserved the trash instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and rejected from Jim Henson's original heart-centered, socially-conscious version. It makes a terrible misunderstanding to a big-hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations.
