Let me break down this movie for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes is a showcase of terrible special effects. I'm not a nitpick of special effects, but what you need to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you should not anchor your movie about special effects. Star ships burn color balls on each other, block into stock explosions and tend to past moons with polygon count low enough to count with their fingers. You have no idea what happens. That does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The other action involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point, you will be treated to kill scenes and illogical, boring battle scenes. No talking. Nothing interesting happens. The protagonist's goal is unclear and is not very convincing. This continues for approx. 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> In a five-minute assembly, she sneaks into an enemy base, straps to a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies. <<br /> <br /> None of this has any bearing on the film's final direction. In the last twenty minutes, the memory of the chicken is basically transferred to its daughter, who stasis for a very large number of years learning the secrets of mankind. After this, we see the first and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the movie, so the new heroine is forced to choose whether or not she will become part of the material that causes the big bang. You know. Because when the universe collapses, you will decide if you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT PEOPLE FROM PEOPLE OVERSE IN A CAPSULA. Maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters, then it's not a good movie for you. The main roles could have been met nicely by some old wind-up toys that are able to stay right on the side while walking through the sand. The whole story is told through painfully boring narrative. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to work deeply by throwing together a whole lot of undeveloped science fiction ideas. There are probably concepts here to burn a variety of movies, but as it stands, it is inflated with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this movie could have been reduced to a 45-second mount. Instead, the narrator tells the story of a story without ever giving us a reason to break with what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas in here, but no one sees movies seeing ideas wrongly explained. People watched movies being entertained. This movie does not entertain.
