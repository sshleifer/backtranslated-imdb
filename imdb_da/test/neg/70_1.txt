Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4 / and what else you would call it. What about .. Crud. <br /> <br /> A collection of people on a Massachusetts Island resort is besieged by a wicked witch's magical powers, killing every human being through gruesome torture methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) takes photos to Linda (Catherine Hickland whose voice and behavior resembles EE-YOR by Winnie the Poo cartoon), a virgin student witchcraft, on the island resort without permission. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, who exhibits an incredibly rude bitch) is interested in buying the resort and together with husband Freddie (Robert Champagne, who always has several other women much younger than him), pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and grandchild Tommy (Michael Manchester, who just bored all the way through, is likely to see Sesame Street instead of staring at this rubbish), going by boat to the resort being treated to look at the property by real estate agent Tony Giordano's son Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) Of course a puppy in the company gets the feet wet. Together with these people, architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a nympho) can help Rose design the resort again. The boat's captain is killed by The Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, wearing her make-up and lipstick extra thick) and a storm brew. The boat runs by itself (.. guided by Lady's invisible power in black, I think) with anyone stuck in the laid-back resort that needs a lot of repairs. Most of the victims, before meeting their pigs fate, are guided through a kind of scum, whose vertebrae leads to a different dimension (maybe some kind of hell or something) where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a curved visage. A victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney, burning like the others lit the fireplace. A poor soul is tortured by hard twisted ropes that are tightly wrapped around her flesh before being found hanging from the string of a swordfish penetrating the throat. A guy is slowly stifling, as his veins (.. and soft) and neck blood vessels burst splashing in Hasselhoff's face! A guy is crucified with nails hammered in his hands before hanging on his head over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim is obsessed with her hair and eventually ends up in another woman's voice. One is raped by this demonic man with a "sick" mouth as the holy hobos are nearby, who are pleasantly pleased. The film is, in spite of overruns, the most boring foot for those who really want to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair who deserve better than this. Almost unbearable at times, building little-to-no excitement. Bloody execution of the death sequences that look cheap and ridiculous. Sure some gore is okay, but most of the movie shows victims after they have run through the ringtone. We get a chance to see pregnant women (who look like stuntmen in a costume with bad wigs) jumping into three-story windows. Oh, and The Lady in Black's reflected face often comes up with lifeless objects for signs to see. Tommy has a small Sesame Street recorder that ties The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chants, which of course is used for later. For some reason, The Lady in Black can visit Little Tommy. He is not afraid of her at all, because Tommy is just too sad to show any expression on his face, much less fear. Should I say more? This is a real stinker. Ugh.
