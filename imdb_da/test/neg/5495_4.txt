I went into this movie that really liked it - it shot a film festival earlier this year and boasted an all-star cast. But (and you could tell that there was a "but" coming) it is a mistake in a movie. Outstanding character that works by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by editing and antics of the supporting cast. Turturros performance is deficient, and most of the comedy is overplayed. The recurring puppet shows are meaningless, and a few scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> It is said that there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the movie. A really touched scene, several of the seductions, and a few of the comic colors, actually withdraw. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by the diffuse, incoherent script and some bad plays.
