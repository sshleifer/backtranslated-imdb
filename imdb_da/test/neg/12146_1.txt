This is a joke, right? This can't be a real movie? It's not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a camcorder and they could make a better movie than this. The film producer can't be serious ... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama has gone terribly wrong? The scripture is about being lonely and boring, as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could make a better manuscript. The dialogue is not clichéd. Clichédialog can raise this holiday mess to something that resembles camp fun - but it doesn't and it's not. Worst of the worst - a landlady walks into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed in a bathrobe with a frying pan like something out of a "honeymoon" episode. Whaaa ??? I've seen better actors from middle school drama clubs. One of the leaders is an attractive lunk, the other is not. Both can't even make a convincing kiss. So much for romance. Supporting players are over-the-top. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a nauseous soundtrack, and the sound seems to have been recorded in a toilet toilet. Most of the dialogue is (unforgettable) incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This stale cinematic fruit cake is not even worth the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay vacation of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. It's simply bad. In every way. VIEWS OF SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head - they will stomp your every expectation. Has an omelette and stares in thoughtlessly at the neighbor's holiday light - it is time better spent.
