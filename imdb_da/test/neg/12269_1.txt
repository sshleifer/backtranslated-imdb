I love watching Australian movies, but this steaming pile of crap was simply embarrassing. The DVD deck looked promising, but you know what they say, don't judge a DVD using the cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that it won Best Actor for a prize, but the competition must have been really bad because the play in this movie is pathetic. It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to lead and act as he really had to focus on part of the film production and get it right before he spread too thin. The music was quite ordinary. The story didn't go anywhere. It was just a sequence of battles that were stretched along with bad script and cheesy dialogue. <br /> <br /> I would say this to all hopeful filmmakers themselves. Watch this movie. It will give you hope that your movie will win something at a festival. <br /> <br /> But good at them to come in and take a ride. Hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better.
