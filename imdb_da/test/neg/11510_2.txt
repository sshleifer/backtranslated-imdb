The first time I saw an advertisement for this show was when my sisters watched the Kim Possible movie. Commercially, Sadie and his friend showed nothing to discuss the meaning of the word. It's one of the stupid advertisements I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like "Nothing is something, so technically nothing is anything". When I saw it, I figured it would be another lame Lizzie Maguire knockoff of Disney. But I had no idea how bad. <br /> <br /> Fast forward for 3 weeks when my sister turns on T.V. Of course, Sadie was accidentally on. What I saw was one of the most unintentional fun shows I've ever seen. How did it go? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian wooden frame, has an incredibly unhealthy, obsessive crush on the very monotonous and ill-acted Owen. For some reason her friend Margret decides that Owen should "be tested" to see if he is as good as he thinks. What do these tests mean? Well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on their notebook. Why? So she can be squeamish and ask her monotonous knight in shining armor to get it off. How is this a test? Because if he squishes it, he is mediocre and creepy and does not think that bugs that Sadie puts it "are innocent animals too". They spread disease and suffering! THEY WANT TO BE SQUISHED! But of course, Owen just brushes it out of the window, and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margret says he has to be challenged once again about something that "no guy can pass". This involves pushing scarves into their pants (yes, you are reading the right one) and going to buy him to see if he is noticing their big dust. Predictably he does not notice and we see Sadie in his bizarre and strange notebook world. Sadie decides she'll be with Owen forever, educate a family with him, and she says "live like the tendencies with their bread". It's just pretty wrong. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is the weirdest, most insane show I've seen. For those who like to make fun of stupid things, you will love it. For anyone else, skip this show.
