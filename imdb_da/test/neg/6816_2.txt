"Dogmatic", as another reviewer described this movie, is an appropriate word. The director's idea was to present Bach without plot, acting, fun, theater, dialogue, story or drama. Mission done, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematic?" No way. This is anti-cinema. No one is moving. Hardly anyone speaks. The camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: Very much occasionally the camera will dolly in. You can catch a glimpse of Gustav Leonhardt's fingers that move over the keys. That is it. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​staring at the back of a harpsichordist (moving) head for 7 minutes on a stretch while listening to Bach, this is the movie for you. I'd rather listen to Bach on my closed eyes stereo.
