Great. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. In addition, we must have more propaganda about murdering disabled people. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we should be flooded with these sparsely spoiled euthanasia advertisements. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything to solve about this movie. What can be redeemed for a man without courage to continue, despite adversity. It does not take courage to commit suicide. It's a prison act. Sharing this "desire" with her woman just brings her with the same illness he has. If this had been a movie of a man's courage to continue despite his problems, like the Jill Kinmont story, it would have made it a good movie. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing true courage, check out the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ship accident.
