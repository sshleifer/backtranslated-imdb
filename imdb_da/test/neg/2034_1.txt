It is early in the morning of our dissatisfaction, and some of my friends and I just got through to see the "wind". Really a disaster movie. Not in the form of forces of nature that cause chaos to an unsuspecting population, but rather a horrible film that causes chaos in an unsuspecting audience. To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to see this particular bomb, I will give you an example quoted during my first painful display. If one gets the choice to watch this movie for a second time and say, cook myself, I'm afraid to say that the election would not be an instant. But instead of just tearing "ad peliculam" with miserable one-liners, I will get exactly why my friends and I have panned this movie. <br /> <br /> To start it, I like the low budget horror flicks. I even like artsy, low budget horror flicks. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Movies that were ambitious and bold, though lacking in production value, performance, and even action. In general, an interesting premise, unusual camera technique or just a well done scene or two will store a movie that runs a little rough around the edges. With these reservations in mind I would like to say finally that I hated "The Wind." <br /> <br /> The movie was probably the most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. From the protagonists' actions, to the stream (?) Of the plot, to the large porters, hinting at the opening, which ultimately sought dust (and did not even logically explain what happened in the rest of the movie and left the viewer , expecting something more, with a feeling of much ado about nothing). The dialogue was spotty at best, wood delivered and totally unrealistic. By this I mean, no one in the situations that the characters were in would have responded as the characters did or said the things they said as they said to them. There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have addressed this problem. <br /> <br /> Character interaction and development was unpleasant. Claire, the "paralyzing sex goddess", or so the aggravating, passive aggressive paralysis of the film believed, was so obvious in her manipulations, she might as well have drawn a gun to the characters. Nevertheless, she was the shining highlight of the movie. The other protagonists (with the exception of Micks Milfy Mom who were not terrible) are so obscure that they might as well have been portrayed by the same actor. Let's see if I missed something: borderline personality, co-entertaining goons with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, spurred on to fit the puerile rage through the artificial orchestrations of a loose-lipped bimbet-suddenly-and-disorderly-turned caligari . No, I think it covers it. <br /> <br /> Lack of scope was also problematic. How do those who are involved in making this movie expect the informal viewer to deduce that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish, incredible, ill-portrayed venture (what would you call it?) the forest in the middle of the sky? There were no witnesses to the "atrocities" that were presented. There were no witnesses anywhere in this movie. The credibility problems caused by this lack of attention to detail were immense from the point where the plot begins to sit. Case-in point: If that guy Bob took that route through the forest to get home from the gym and here is the key **** every day ****, there is a really good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards, while the perpetrators argued heavily about the crime scene. One would think that by the murder of a young man in the forest, the city would have been in turmoil, the signs would have been questioned, etc. But instead there was no witness in sight (except Earl, the closet psychopath without inner monologue) . We suggest that there are no witnesses * for this movie either. <br /> <br /> As for the quasi-gay meanderings present, I have no problem with them either. It's not as if they came as a surprise, considering that we had shouted at the closet with the statue of most of the male characters since the second scene. Again, not problematic in itself, but thrown in for the wrong reasons. It was completely unnecessary, cast in for pure "shock" and / or "dangerous art" value, and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. What we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a dull, lumpy movie with a dull, lumpy plot. The badly hinted sexual excitement, which was only suggested heavily in anticipation of this dormant scene, shot only this film further down the totem pole from "mediocrity that justifies criticism" to "movies that suck so badly that it lacks the inherent grace to Suck enough to muck and harangue properly. "So it is with most of the film, a lot of artistic fumbling, very little meat and a lot of aggravation. It's not that we don't get it. Oh, we got it okay. We just don't want it. Seeing the fact that we were cheering on bludgeoning in the final scene as the only * tableau that made sense on the face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this movie. Instead of moving quickly together as the name suggests, this movie ran long like the sweat track, which works, it's far down the side of the nose while your hands are full. Argh. This feeling is quite well summed up in the gut-breaking frustration that was realized while looking at this train wreck. There is no fresh air with regard to this movie, only the obsolete miasma of bad ideas poorly realized, putrefying before coming to fruition.
