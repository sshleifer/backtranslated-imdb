Yes, it can't be historically accurate (actually only 6 soldiers from the 9th root were killed there), and yes, it has some errors and exaggeration (bent machine gun? Come on!) Or the "story reading" about how Afghanistan was never Conquered by someone - trained Russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it doesn't have millions of dollars in Hollywood-style special effects, but it's the strongest point to show the soldier's life there, their relationship and their feelings when the best friends are killed in front of their eyes. In my opinion 9ya Rota really does a good job with all these things. <br /> <br /> Again, the film has weaknesses, but in my opinion it seems to be one of the strongest Russian films over the last few years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
