The "Dungeon of Harrow" had a lot of things that could have made this right a good scary movie. Wrong mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a hand, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. But unfortunately this was not done so well. <br /> <br /> An author and a skipper become shipwrecked on an island owned by a counter in a castle, his slave, and a stupid girl. The count becomes increasingly suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and are more likely to turn them on and submit them, and the stupid girl who turns to them, tortures and imprisons. Doesn't sound bad right? <br /> <br /> Not quite. I used to call this one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because it had so much potential, it can't really be called "one of the worst." But since all this potential goes into play, it's really a big hit against this movie. All in all, it's not a really good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very gothic thrill when our hero is chained to the dungeon and confronted with the crazy and leper bride adorned in a tattered wedding dress. This was both scary and disturbing the first time I saw the horror unfold in this scene. The man I wish this was a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the right things to make this a moody sennate cooler, but ultimately took all the wrong turns. I suggest someone repeats this.
