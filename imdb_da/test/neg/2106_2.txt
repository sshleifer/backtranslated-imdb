Really, really awful. I don't even know where to start. This is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself. I am not sure that I could assign myself a category myself, except that I am absolutely sure it is a pat on the face of everyone, anywhere. Even the unborn. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was looking at a parody or some sort of farce. At times, just a bad B movie. But I adhered to the porn I fear is almost (but not entirely) non-existent. Anyone had to jump to the end. I certainly wanted the other feeling. The last five minutes are intense, and certainly include some of the best movie-making pictures / cgi you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
