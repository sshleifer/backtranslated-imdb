This movie somehow shows 6.2 stars. It seems unthinkable that the director has so many relationships. I'm at a loss to explain this. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on the ground, do not waste 1 and 1/2 of them on this delayed steaming pile of Guano !!! <br /> <br /> There is no story that apparently the director "wrote" (and I guess with a blunt orange crayon) next day's script at the end of today's recording. The "story" has been called moody, no it is futile, perhaps there is "history" to fill a commercial. Don't you hate ads? <br /> <br /> Now, while both leaders can act, of course they didn't decide here. And in the same way, the author / director can actually both write and correct as it appears from his next work "Toy Love" <br /> <br /> So to resume even if you get this movie for free even if you're paid to watch It avoids it. <br /> <br /> Rewriting Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail, "Run Fly!"
