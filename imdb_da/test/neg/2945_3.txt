TWINS EFFECT is a bad movie in many respects. The only good thing is that it doesn't take itself seriously. Apart from that, this is not really a movie, but rather a merchandising tool for the movie's two stars, popular pop idols in their home Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly designed and acted. The direction gives some stupid martial arts, which is strange as the action director (and apparently co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong-adapted films for teenagers, the big fanbase of "actors" like the twins (the two girls who originate in this movie) and Ekin Cheng, are so bad music to convey to the audience that some scenes are fun, clever, etc. The final conclusion: It is too nothing. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, this is a bad movie. Not fun enough, not serious enough, and just generally for bubble gum fake for his own good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> For a more in-depth review of this movie and other foreign films, go to http://www.nixflix.com
