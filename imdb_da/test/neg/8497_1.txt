This movie has made me angry. I think the original of this movie, "The Mask," was a great movie, worth buying and watching. I strongly believed that they should make a sequel, but when I saw this, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This movie has spoiled the whole idea of ​​'The Mask'. Mask Mode? A baby is flying around in a room? My little brother, who is seven, did not even laugh, and he is in these childish films, but it was worse. A lot of crap !! I'm telling you now, please don't see this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you can actually have fun! See 'The Mask', but don't, I DO NOT repeat, see this foam of junk. Thank you.
