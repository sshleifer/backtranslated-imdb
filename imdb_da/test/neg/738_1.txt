It's hard for a lover of the new Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC custom and stay away from throwing objects on the TV screen. In fact, if Jane Austen were to see this herself, she would be a bit amused and possibly put out. Maggie Wadey's adaptation has made Northanger Abbey the satirized, Gothic novel (and readers of Gothic novels). Catherine Morland's role in the adaptation is depicted relatively close to Austen's Catherine, an open-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But the novel Henry Tilney is not a sniff-taking, sugarcane, sappy-line-making luck in a Gothic novel - he is a tease, an almost beautiful man with a messy room and a living (that's right, Henry Tilney is a priest , a charm completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from the novel, when Henry, the complete death panel, mocks them literally reminded Catherine of diction, magazines, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not depicted in the adaptation. Much of Hrin's personality is lost when these scenes are not customized. In addition, Peter Firth's appearance is not correct - Henry Tilney should be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blonde. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities in the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust - who is the marching day and what is she doing in the story? Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a foam? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? The novel's novel, with its romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern house - another element of satire! Why does General Tilney portray as a drunk? Why does Catherine have the weird visions of Mrs. Allen, who needs her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs with her in Northanger, with Henry there to caution her. And finally, why have so many facts about the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death changed unnecessarily? Making the story more "terrible"? 'All these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked. <br /> <br />>
