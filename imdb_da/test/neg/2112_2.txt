How on earth can you get such great actors in such a miserable creation? This is one of the most stylized pieces of waste I've seen for a long time. Not only is it badly written, it is a product of scary direction and editing. The kinematics are so terribly manipulative and unoriginal, and the montage is beyond belief. The real ideas behind the charts (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are all fine at first, but where the production / direction team takes them, a big cesspool of filth, some of which are seen in an episode. And this is a scientific series? I am a doctor and all I can say is that the science of this movie is utter shit, almost embarrassing to see. I felt really bad for the actors involved, as they were all extraordinary.
