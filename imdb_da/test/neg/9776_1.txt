*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some bunch of Africans-Hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard height in the middle of a true desert area. Spoilers: The stupid one begins to hit the mound with a pick and crack it openly. Then he looks into the hole and holds his head in and TRANSMISSION! something eats him. The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy, but he plays a kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (meaning he must be at least 35 years old). Bairstow must attend Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of kinds of entertainment that usually fills movies like "PITCH BLACK" "THE THING", etc. The truck is driven over the first truck and they decide to investigate how Did the truck not see the other truck when they drove to pick up Bairstow as they were on the same road?). So they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects related to bones with small pieces of meat on them. The most important lunatic in the group, Karl, decides to find the killer. Then the truck drives around in the desert after some tracks, and eventually it has an electric card, and the crew is stuck in the desert. The stupid guy in this group had brought a bunch of bones with his jacket to carry them around. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket), the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs over and sticks his arm in the goo, and the dummy loses his arm too. Sounds exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow, the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants that use the bones to hold each other together to travel to a new hive (because the miners burst open the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, ants could move themselves without having to kill people to use the bones for structure. If all they needed was something hard, they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used them to make a form. The whole story is real, really stupid, and the ant explanation is the only one given. The rest of the movie is just about the group being killed until they find the new antestasis and killing the ant brain (black-off), and the hundreds of thousands of ants go away on their own itty-bitty feet. There is an extra ant brain found (off-camera) and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a successor.
