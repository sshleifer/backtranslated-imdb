The film, Himmelporten, was a good view, but still boring for over 4 hours. But the movie took a big license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and "Elle" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County War was to start it by hanging. Now by starting it, I mean it came at the start, not at the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one could give a family each family. By filing as individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose hometowns at Crazy Woman Creek, which actually controlled the water over the land held by a strong member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them several times as they refused. Although they are characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (cattle cat) and a prostitute himself (and also in the film), there is no true evidence that it was true. It is known that she bought many sick cattle, nursed them back to life and was later accused of the cattleman's association for receiving the cattle in trade for "malevolent acts". Eventually she was accused of appalling - an act almost completely untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the American West, which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a period of about a hundred years. In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattlemans Association, taken and immediately hanged. Those who commit injustice were never brought to justice, but it was the first link that led to the Nate Champion murder and the start of the Johnson County war. <br /> <br /> Completely different from the Hollywood version, which shows its shot at the end. <br /> <br /> Other than that, I think the main problem with movies was the editor, who could have made the action quicker by more skillful editing.
