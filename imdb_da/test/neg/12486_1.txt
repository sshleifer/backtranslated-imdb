I'm a big Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got a scene in the movie. This was also my favorite scene where he confiscated the character's weapon and led her to Down Below. Unfortunately, unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action took place. I didn't care about Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is okay but no Sinclair. I like Lochley, but she only had limited screen time. If you like crusades or spaces, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give it 1/10.
