I went into this movie and hoped for an imaginative twist on the second coming. Boy, was I ever wrong. The BBC is dullards to pacify a movie, assembling idiots by creating excitement, fool at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, pacing and time-consuming laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I continued to look down at my watch wondering when the senseless, monotonous drive would end. They wasted a very good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy and smashed written. All that happens is just to kill the time. Out of 155 minutes, only 15 minutes is interesting (the controversial end). What a shame. Reading the plot is more interesting than watching the movie. The sermon, the "I am God" endless blah blah-ing, the stupid as the doorstep boring miracles ... UGH. Don't see this crown.
