I hate being too critical, but one was really bad. I like the brothers in Baldwin, I just wished there was more talent evenly distributed among them. I liked the general plot, but there was just too much "experiment" and not enough "do" in terms of quality. <br /> <br /> My favorite character out of it all was bald policeman. He reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (I think Jeremy Roberts) from Start Trek 6: Undiscovered Country. Just without the hair. <br /> <br /> If you have Hollywood Video's MVP program and are really trying to get your money's worth, then through this with one of the three MVP movies you download. It's worth it for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The most impressive special feature throughout the show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's rifle burning. I suppose it will leave you a bit of the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
