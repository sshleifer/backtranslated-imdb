This movie should have a disclaimer that it was related to the Left Behind series. I didn't know it would be a Bible-thumping movie. I expected it to be really a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for the sake of entertainment. As previously reported comments, it would be nice to show in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the film's performance is about. I felt deceived by my $$ used to this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones. If you go to church, it will probably be shown for free for some time. Except for the coverage of the true subject, the film was fine in terms of acting and scripting. But I have to say that I went into the movie for an hour when I saw the direction it was heading and that I should not be entertained, but preached to.
