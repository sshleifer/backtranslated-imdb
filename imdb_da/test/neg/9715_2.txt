Too bad Mike Meyers picked this up for his dramatic debut. This movie looks like it was composed of a selection that couldn't decide whether it was comedy, drama, excitement or sci-fi. It starts to be wonderful, so it quickly gets darker, and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the protagonists has been killed, the whole family stands in the backyard and laughs at something. It is quite strange and impossible to lace up. The action is extremely uneven, with the older professionals engaging, and then the younger and less experienced actors look as if they are in high school. This movie showed me that it is probably harder to make a good movie than it appears from the really professional fare we see in the first round and art houses. This would be a good movie for a movie class analysis. Plot, character, theme, texture - they are all either defective or missing from this movie.
