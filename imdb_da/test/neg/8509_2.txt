If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; Prepare for perhaps the best movie experience ever! If you have ... After reading the books several times, I have for many years come to love the characters and the story, and feel I know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, the Hobbiton and the character gallery. So for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (inevitably), it changes events, it removes important history, it removes so important history. Big clumps of what makes the Lord of the Rings what it is are simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects cannot do Tolkien's (and your own) fantasy justice. Peter Jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible and I don't think others could have done better! But the fact is, I'm sorry to see the movie. The next time I read the Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will jump forward, not my own.
