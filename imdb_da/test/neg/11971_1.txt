I can't believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage! The action was so bad, my grandmother could have done better. The punches thrown into the movies were not near the character Scarecrow knocked on the floor. The movie was a task to see! <br /> <br /> So this group of baseball jocks decides to go cheering even after they don't have to multiply in order form that trains under impact. So of course they go anyway. They decide to attach a loser to a post with the so-called "Scarecrow." When the loser's best friend finds out this, he and his girlfriend go to rescue him. <br /> <br /> The baby has found out to have diabetes and is hospitalized while the jockeys head out to the beach the next day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all a lot. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really don't care. Anyway ends the scarecrow with a connection with the "Diabetes Boy" and the boy begins to finish the bird crawling company when scarecrow is killed. Yes, it's really real cheeses. <br /> <br /> It thought this movie was full of bull sh * t. Sooner or later the only ones living (of course) are boyfriend and boyfriend who are the main characters :) The evil is then transmitted to the girlfriend and he kills himself to break the curse so no one else will be hurt. Touch? No, don't play your hard earned money on this, I'll give it a score on one as it's low, otherwise it doesn't even deserve that much.
