"Graduation Day" is a result of the success "Friday the 13th". Both of these films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than excitement. If you enjoy that kind of movie, I'd recommend "Graduation Day." If not, I wouldn't. There is nothing new here, just the same old murders. <br /> <br /> Although I have given the movie a 4 out of 10, I would say it is not a repulsive movie. It can be seen if you are curious about it, just not creative.
