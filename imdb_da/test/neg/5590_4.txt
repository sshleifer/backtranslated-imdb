STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring ) is a couple in Budapest, on business obligations and staying at a luxury hotel. One night they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place where they end up in a triangle. Everything is good until David receives some negatives in the post and he and Tish are being blackmailed. But when some people involved in the fraud are found murdered, it gets cluttered and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track the woman who can hold the key to everything. <br /> <br /> While the original movie was about the concept of snus movie, this straight two DVD sequel is about the healthier (!!!) theme for threesomes and sleazy sex. It plays like a porn movie, a cheap piece of titillation with lots of hot T / A action going on. If it sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you might like it, but you'd be more at home in a porn store than a video store. <br /> <br /> This is trying to copy the original movie's dark and voyeuristic feel, but it still does well, but it still can't hold onto the original. It has an apathetic history, with a risky narrative stream. And compared to Cage, Schaech comes across as interminably wood. Better than I thought it would be, I suppose, and better than your average one of those DVD directors, seems to come out a lot these days, but really haven't we seen enough? **
