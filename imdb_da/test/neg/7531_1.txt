So the movie on it is Lawrence, Kansas's premiere. This scary story of a group of disgruntled highschoolers who killed the competition for prom queen was just awful. It fails for many reasons - bad action, bad script, no clear point. But mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves: "Hi I have some money, let's make a movie!" - Without really thinking it out Sorrowfully most indie movies that don't make it suffer from this particular mentality. They just don't seem to realize that making a good movie requires more than money ... or in this case even a foldable one. With this movie, I'm not ashamed to say that if I didn't know anything about the crew, I'd have gone out. Simple as that.
