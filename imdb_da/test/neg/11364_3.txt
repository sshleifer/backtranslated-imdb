An obvious cash-in on * Insert Monster Here * On a flight simulator, Flight Of The Living Dead is what you expect to be. <br /> <br /> The movie has little or no plot, which is what one would expect from a movie of this type. Although it's fun in parts, I have to say. Zombie action is particularly entertaining. When the movie fetches, it never stops; pacing is solid. <br /> <br /> The practical special effects are pretty good, but CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The ending seems to leave the film open for a sequel. Let's hope it won't work. <br /> <br /> If you're a die-hard fan of the zombie subgenre of horror movies, I'd recommend it to you; It is worth at least one clock. But if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
