Generally, I don't make negative comments here. But since this is a festival piece, I don't want you wasting your time when you could see something else that might not play again. I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they did not play completely apart, but they waited to RECITE their lines which were rather poor at first. The dialogue was really forced. Norman or whatever his name tried, or it seems to be witty and biting in the lines he chose, but just fell short. In words, he asked if anyone saw the end coming and some people were all "yes" and he called them all liars only. See, there were so many tracks, the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $ 500 one hour whore. I mean, John gave her at least 20g's ... tell signs. Now no, you couldn't see exactly what would happen, but when it came, I didn't even come. I was just happy to get out of there. I asked him what draft he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he'll wait to shoot 'to 15.3 because it needed a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed like a pretty good guy, he's making his own movies, he'll be better, and I hope he does it, not even in the twisted way, I mean, I wish him good luck. Just remember, it's just my opinion.
