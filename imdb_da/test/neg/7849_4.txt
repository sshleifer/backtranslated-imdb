Perhaps the director tried for another PIRATE (Good Garland and Kelly musical) - but this lame musical era falls flat. Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson's voices do not interfere well - and their chemistry together lacks spark. The prerequisite for Sinatra as a sweet guy trying to imitate his late "bandito" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role. What is amazing and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather eerie song and make it special - his formulation and eloquence as a singer makes you want to hear it again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe she doesn't sing anything else and not that interesting. She has her big moment with "Love is where you find it" that fits her perfectly and shows her abilities. The photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as costumes and sets. Co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash put a lot of energy into doing the impossible work. Apart from Sinatra song, there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It is fascinating and strange. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is a real oddity.
