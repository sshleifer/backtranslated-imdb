Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, had a vibrant sense of description that made this book amazing. When I read this book, I had every scene quite pronounced in my head and I knew what each figure looked like. This book had many pieces, and when I finished reading this book, it seemed that the puzzle was complete. When I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I saw the movie, which was a mistake. The film cuts so many essential parts. For example, the novel Marlow waited a very long time for the rivals to come for him to straighten his boat. This was a great source of invalidity. In the film, the part had just been released. The movie added several parts that were useless and made no sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. What purpose does that scene have, except getting the audience to apologize to the monkey? It's as if the screenwriter didn't even read the entire book and just put the parts he read in the movie. If I hadn't read the novel before I had seen the movie, I would have been thoroughly confused. The book was amazing and it really is a classic in American literature, but the film could have been defiantly nominated for the worst picture in the Razzie Awards.
