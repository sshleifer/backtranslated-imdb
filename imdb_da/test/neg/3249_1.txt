This movie made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So incredible and the worst plot ever. The action was also poor. I do not how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses continued to make this movie. The scripture must have been something of a joke. The visual effects in this movie were incredibly painful to watch. I think a kindergarten child could have done a better job with the visual effect, and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot. The plot has many attempts to copy great Hollywood movies like Terminator, but it fails miserably. I laughed my head away from watching this movie. A total disaster in Indian cinema history!
