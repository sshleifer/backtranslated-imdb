I like all the major actors involved in this rather bizarre movie. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all emerged as some of the best and most talented actors around, but I couldn't get into this. I don't know if that's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I couldn't get my head around this movie. Worse than anything, the actors made some of the ugliest dragons I've ever seen. I think it was part of the point I don't know. I realize it's probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I have to say I bought the guys as the artists (the correct expression?), But the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. I would say that I usually do not appreciate costume designers very well, although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very impressed with them. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I don't think they should be. I don't know I'm certainly not the target audience and would never see a performance performed by these kind of artists, but I didn't want to see ballet or opera either, so I don't know. If this is your kind of movie then you will probably like it, but if it doesn't skip it because it's ... not for most of us. I just checked it won the Oscar for costume design & I would rightly say it. I have to say that Ebert wasn't much interested in this movie, even though he liked it better than I did.
