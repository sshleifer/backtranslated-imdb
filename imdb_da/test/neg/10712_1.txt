This should be one of the worst movies ever to get out of the Sci-Fi Channel. Here's how the movie starts. Women are the only people on this planet because of the fact that in the chemical war that is not distant, it is OK as long as it is only targeted at soldiers (If you wonder, Men) But the virus back fires (big shock ) and all men on the ground die slowly. Then all male form is condemned to die when the French president is shot and killed by a man. Now that we have taken about 60 to 70 years from now, two female scientists are working to clone a female baby and one of them says "Hey, why don't we bring men back?" The other says no, the world is not ready for it, but immediately ignores her and so a man goes again. <br /> <br /> First, this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters. Secondly, the author forgot to mention that today's soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers, so there is no real reason to get such a virus. This is the greatest waist time you can find. This movie managed to offend my intellect not only of the bad story but with the life style. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give this a 1 out of 10 but only because I couldn't go lower.
