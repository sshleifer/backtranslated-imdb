I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds because it was bad, Seagal was not to blame it was down in the scream as the few action scenes took place. The plot was also confusing and felt just rushed, perhaps it was shrewd and released to take advantage of Seagal's newer movie? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> He is not through yet, bring on siege 3 and lose some weight!
