Sometimes Hallmark can get it right - like the 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films are looting, and it falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] Shown in the trailer, and advertising still images do not appear), but all that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILY WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY SPEECH: At least, the movie updates the story to the early 20th century (?), and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - be Lexx fan, I kept expecting him to say, "the dead do not solve puzzles") 18-year-old. Hans Christian Andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shadow of ice in his eye, goes bad, is taken off the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace, and Gerda goes to find him and has different adventures on the way. <br /> <br /> As the two main characters are older than in the original, much time is spent getting them together and 'in love'. Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to understand Gerda's mission. At the time the main plot kicks in, the movie's pace has slowed down to a crawl. Alas, when Gerda begins his search for Kai, only manages to pick up the pace for a leisurely stroll. <br /> <br /> There are a few strange additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the start of the film, the snow queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation is given for this. A polar bear living in the snow queen's palace is more than he thinks (although perhaps the producers realized that the bear's feelings to the Snow Queen would be ok in a Fairy Tale, but not in a modern movie). Again, this is never explained. Also refers to the fact that the snow queen has an erotic desire for kai, has fallen, but never followed through. Scripture is also full of anachronisms that truly destroy you from the 'mood of adventure. <br /> <br /> Production looks good, though there are signs of penny-pinching: The Snow Queen's Palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai comes across as bland as Gerda originally, but when she sets off to find Kai, she is warm to her. Bridget Fonda looks good like Snow Queen, but seems to be in another movie for everyone else. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is unsatisfactory. It looks good but draws and lacks magic.
