I just looked at a forensic marathon at Court TV. The section was identical to the plot of this movie, right down to the incest secret and affair-with-sister's subplot. I don't remember anyone based on a True Story disclaimer, but the case has MOW written over it. Apparently, the real murder of Ruby Morris is crowned by her husband, Earl, sentenced to 25 years of life for her murder. Just go to show you, the truth may be alien to fiction, because I thought the life plan was constructed and more than "a stretch" as far as credibility goes. I'm with the other posters who said the play was bad. However, I didn't notice it with all the players. It was really the main character, the daughter, whose performance was poor.
