The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that it forced me to record and comment. I must add here that I am a movie bird that rarely passes hard judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly constructed, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with such a small line of history that it commits criticism. I am surprised at all the demands of how amazing, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that cast and crew are active posters here. The action was extremely thin. The pace of the movie was disturbing. I gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because I didn't want to waste a Saturday morning in NY), but with each new scene it dragged longer and delivered characters where I didn't interest me. I couldn't connect, because who I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> When I see negative reviews on IMDb of small independent films like this, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal ax to paint (something like that. he used to dance the foreman, she dumped him, and now he has to scrap everything she ever works on. But here, no. I know no one who worked on this movie. And I wish it would have been good. But the movie was not dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . They indicate that I am connected to the movie. . . no, Henry May Long was just too long, empty and boring. <br /> <br /> It's Tomas taking on this one.
