I first thought that this little fantasy excursion would be a little entertaining. I was mistaken. <br /> <br /> A good cast (Roy Scheider as president) did not help. History had every conceivable possible worst-case scenario that could take place in a terrorist catastrophe. And none of it could possibly happen! <br /> <br /> True - The president's kidnapping could only be done with a traitor in the secret service (ala Air Force One), but all they portrayed about football and our helpless land if it were to fall into enemy hands is ridiculous for the Nth degree. Seriously, not even the president can fully ride over our missile control. The case is only used for relay orders. In this situation, our system would have completely erased the codes and everything would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - there would have been no missile start because the silo herds would have been instructed not to (communication includes a hardwired system). There are just too many security guards to prevent such a thing from happening. <br /> <br /> True, movies like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE are somewhat credible for the concept of losing control of the SYSTEM. But this movie goes too far and fails to suspend my concept for the incredible. And that makes the experience a waste of the viewers' time. This movie is a mistake.
