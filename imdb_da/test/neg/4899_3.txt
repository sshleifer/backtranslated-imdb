It's a shame Barry Humphrie's infamous Sir Les Patterson character had the filmm debut in this subordinate spy / comedy. This movie reminded me of Beatty / Hoffman stinks, Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned from the mistakes that movies made - if you want to change gear on a concept, don't use SPIES! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes give a promise of something else. It would have been great to see the anachronistic and bourgeois Patterson who roamed the world of Australian politics. One of the signs even points out that Patterson is currently with the present times - one thinks Humphires could have had a field day commenting on the Hawke government (I can only see a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinking competition). But instead of a movie that may have been clever and even a biting look into that world, we get Patterson running around the world, as James Bond tries to save the world from biochemical weapons that run out of steam before halfway marking. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
