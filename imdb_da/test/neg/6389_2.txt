This slice of derived drift stole from each Soviet movie of note and failed miserably. I was left with an experience of everything wrong with the organized religion in general and the special deficiencies of the Russian Orthodox Church (remember that this comment comes from a believer). Even the excellent crew left me uninspired. I spent his most beautiful moments paying close attention to masterworks that it was poorly mimicking. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in communism and the seventies. It's a pointless movie from (and around) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing to me.
