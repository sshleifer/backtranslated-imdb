I'm glad I didn't expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite childhood films. The story was blunt and convincing as were the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also didn't think the characters themselves were the same from the previous movie. Charlie was changed, and now he has a girlfriend. The first movie had good music, but the music in this movie was unmemorable. In short, this movie just didn't make it for me. And looking at other user feedbacks, it seems that it didn't do that for many of you. It's not worth seeing.
