I actually look forward to this movie. After reading a number of reviews before the release, it sounded like a really nice film, a beautiful film and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.). It could have been all these things, but it is so boring that I defy almost everyone to get through this whole and keep attention. Cage attempts to speak with an Italian accent are also embarrassingly bad. He is such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Disappointing" seems to be the most commonly used word by reviewers here to describe this movie and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I don't think it took long after words to figure out how bad this movie was, because what Cage's accent didn't do well.
