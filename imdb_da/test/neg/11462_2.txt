Is it really possible that so many people in this movie think the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and has dark makeup, should she be a witch? And I got the impression that the film is trying to present her as someone who is "different," someone understands no one ... She's just a teenager and some stupid girls in high school say she's a witch and everyone believe in her. In addition, Brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so ... False. She did not convince me that she is not a witch, not that I would believe it in the first place. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and she seems like she's not quite sure if she's a witch or not. And how they dressed her to court - I see old ladies every day who wouldn't wear it even though it was the last outfit in the world! Brandi's brother was also not convincing ... But you see the important thing is that "she put the bad, bad girl back to earth at the end of the movie". "She has won the match, proved to everyone that she is different." <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in life, too low. I only watched it because there was nothing else on TV at the moment, so I was sentenced to this garbage can. Don't waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the 7-star rating, I almost fainted ... It doesn't deserve it compared to some other movies that are also rated 7 stars.
