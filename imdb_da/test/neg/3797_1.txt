4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of pure tedium, melodrama and horrible plays, a mess on a script and a sinking sense of good gentleman, what did they think? <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen was just trying to redeem the popularity of the original classic D class movie minus script, the actors of course were just in the payslip too ... scare, horror! <br /> <br /> How insane are the characters that Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field play? Enter a potentially deadly ship that is 1. on fire 2. Hot from steam 3. Slippery from water and oil, 4. boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc., All for love of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, much less a hug, hook etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle is so overbearing that I just wanted to smack him! Stop it! And what about the bad toupee? There is also no way you can believe his character was a WW2 veteran. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden find all that gold and money and they are happy - whoopee! We are rich! (We must not live to use it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And that's the big character actor Slim Pickens! Survivors galore! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! <br /> <br /> The final dramatic subplot of the scary plutonium never went anywhere, it's like the forgotten kinds? Lots of gaps in the script. <br /> <br /> This movie has a disease that the strongest pill couldn't cure. I'm surprised Alan J. Smithee's name wasn't on the manuscript, I'd be embarrassed to have written this! <br /> <br /> Oh, the mind, oh mankind! Oy Vey! The Horror, The Horror! It's like a bad TV-hour television movie. <br /> <br /> At least, the sets were made from recycled material from the first movie. <br /> <br /> The script should be on the compost heap ...
