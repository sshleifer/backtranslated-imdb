That this film has been attached to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is truly dead. Am I the only one who really saw (rather slept) through this "movie"? This is the only movie I have ever seen in the theater that I regret not going out and claiming my money back - it was just so boring. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From the beginning to the end, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry like two unlikelies, thrown together by circumstances that eventually work together as best friends. The action (how small there is) is greasy and as boring as the author's skull. Thanks, no matter what God is chorting down on us as it observes our "cinema" that there is no chance of an "Air America 2."
