This is by far the most stupid, idiotic, insanely stupid show ever in the air, and it comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". My wife loves to see reality shows - and there was an episode of this drive where the wannabes had to develop a "walk". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough. <br /> <br /> And then there are the ubiquitous Ms Banks (as if laughing all the way to ...). She must be the most annoying self-serving woman on television since Rosie O'Donnell left "The View". As if modeling did great things for humanity. Please. I have never found her attractive, and I cannot find her intelligent now as she has tightness to open her mouth. Anyone should tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
