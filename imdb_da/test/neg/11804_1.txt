The signs are annoying, immature and flaky .... Madison is the most annoying thing for everyone. OOH ... a cold place! Such a serious threat! Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! To make a long story short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair flying over a room can be scary, but it's about as exciting as it gets. I once saw it, and when one of my kids wanted to see it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat on the TV instead of seeing this nonsense again. If you want a good scary movie or even a passable comedy then it is not! The only good part of it all was the "roach scene" and at the end of the movie you ended up getting sad!
