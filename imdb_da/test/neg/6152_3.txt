The film has so much potential that was not developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance, and so does Bill Paxton. The landscape is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft is nice. The problem with this movie is that the story is underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. The movie at certain points puts you almost asleep. I give it 3 out of 10 stars for flying scenes.
