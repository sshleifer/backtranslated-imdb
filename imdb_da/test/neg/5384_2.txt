From an artistic point of view, the film fails to entertain or give any moral solution. The reason is hard to follow if there is one at all. The play is hard to stomach. The dialogue is cliche and clearly written by someone who cannot speak English. Only the filmmaker was worth watching in this movie, even if you still see errors in the picture. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the movie made me feel like it was how smart-minded people can be. Politically speaking, it should be forbidden to put Asian women in such shameful roles. Understanding stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only bad for Asian women's self-esteem, but also for the country as a whole. I feel for the leading actress who played Maya and the exploitation she must have faced playing such a role. As Americans, avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for each other and not hold it back.
