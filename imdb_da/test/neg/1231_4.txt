Okay, so I forgot to see and only caught the last episode and thought it was the first or second. Honestly, I thought CM would have at least one extra installment to solve plot points. The Rangers are back stranded on the plains ("we must eat the horses") for one thing. Little Newt is deprived of another. What a downer ends! But my biggest complaint, esp. If this were the final, the episode had no excitement, no great climax, no dramatic confrontation. Even the last match between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was poorly staged. The whole episode had terrible pacing, which is what drives a western one. Steve Zahn was alert, Karl Urban (a ringtone to Johnny Knoxville) played as a man with a terminal case of lockjaw. All glowing looks and jingling spurs and chopped chin. And what's with Rangers? They talked a lot about cleaning up Texas, then painting around in the middle of the city, getting drunk. And how good of Hal Holbrook to borrow Val Kilmer's Mark Twain wig and stache! The set of Austin was like the fake Rock Ridge from Blazing Saddles, all facades. I admit that I was drawn into the plot, but it is mainly because there were many things I didn't get completely thanks to coming late in the story. If I had seen from the beginning, I might not have got episode three. Now I have to see Silverado to clean my palette.
