This is by far the most disgusting and horrible version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be conceived. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did for the characters - but this cruelty is not worth seeing even if you are not familiar with history. Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down at once. Chauvelin would never have a string of women in her bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, or Armand with Minette, who she is. Chauvelin would not accidentally shoot Tony in the head. Chauvelin's name is not, or has it ever been, Paul. They have completely eradicated any reference to Pimpernel's aprons, replacing them instead with James Bond-esque gadgets and gizmos. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie itself ... The makeup is horrific. The women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty marks around her face randomly. The poor, pitiable actors have no script to work with, so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. Dialogue ... Oh, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And whoever is responsible for all the small captions at the bottom of the screen must be forced to see this movie as a punishment. (I counted 13 captions in the first half hour before I gave up. As if we can't figure out that the body of water between England and France is the English channel.) <br /> <br /> The movie - If I can get it to Calling it as it really is just video tapes with a filter - is definitely without redeeming the value. Don't waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivel - instead, look at the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour version or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or whatever it is.
