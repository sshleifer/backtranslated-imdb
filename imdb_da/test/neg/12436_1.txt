See me, don't forget me, I love independent movies but come on! I could hardly sit through it without wanting to kill myself. The director had absolutely no talent and he turned around something that could have been ok for a f *** ing nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the actor was crap. I'm usually a bleeding heart for these low budget movies, but this one didn't even try. Don't waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry to be so hard, but come on! it dragged on and and over and over again. Remember when the kids came into the party with the strange cupcakes and watermelon martinis? How did they just mix together? It made me frustrated with how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and having sex and a "meaningful conversation" with the one they wanted. I know im blathering, but my mind is just buzzing with everything I hated about this movie.
