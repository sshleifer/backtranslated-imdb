Human, I loved Ocean's 11. <br /> <br /> Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the hoist, as each had their own specialized skills needed to draw the finals. What was Oceans 12 in the world? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I suppose it should be Zeta-Jones, but she wasn't really part of the 11 when she tried to raise them and work against them the whole movie ?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones characters boring to some bits from the original movie thrown in to get some pimples on the seats to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the gang was always one step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to throw him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and all of a sudden they are all bullies? The whole movie is such that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay Benedict for the heist they drew on him three years earlier. So the next movie will they again develop courage and brains again and get him back to have them pay him back to the first lift? Pooh Lease ... <br /> <br /> This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes by Matt Damon to the switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first. I tried hard to like it, and I'm usually very easy to please, but I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! Twist - the whole movie didn't have to be made as the real heist was done before everything you've just seen in the last 2 hours. END SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait until it comes on TV, or if you're a fan of the original from 2001, don't see this.
