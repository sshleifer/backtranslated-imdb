A very disappointing movie from Oliver Stone, which, unlike his latest epic "J.FK", does not stimulate any kind of real feeling. "Talk Radio" is about talk-back host "Barry Champlain", a very loud, meaningful man who manages to disturb a lot of people and yet still draw an audience, most of whom want you to call and abuse him. His boss in the movie (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying he is just a shoe dealer with a big mouth. And when Barry (Eric Bogosian) gets deadly threat to the death risk, the final result is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. But "Talk Radio" fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating, pointless movie. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
