John Sayles, what have you done? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments where I could see the great hope of a good story, generous characters, thoughtful dialogue. And then these moments would be quickly covered by layers of bad writing, clumsy direction and sinister action. I really love almost all John Sayles' work, but "Silver City" is terrible. I have a feeling that Sayles might have worked at the beginning of a good story involving illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines, but then he was rushed and fixed the secondary plot line satirizing the Bush administration on it. The two stories are not really connected to each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first three quarters of the film, causing me to lose patience with the whole affair. big mistake is Danny Huston's play. His dialogue in each scene comes with a gawping laugh, regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. I hated this guy at the end of the movie as I was reminded of every bad actor in every high school game I've ever seen. Not having seen Huston in anything else, I don't know if he should blame him or blame Sayles' direction for him any more. Whether he is the unfortunate focus of a very unfortunate movie. <br /> <br /> Just down to the last sledge-subtle final stage, I was disappointed with "Silver City". Sayles when he is best or hey, even Sayles at mediocre, can be so much better than this movie. See ALL of his other works instead. This is not even worth renting.
