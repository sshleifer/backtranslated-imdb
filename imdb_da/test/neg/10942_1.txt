Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off from the movie Amadeus. I personally consider Amadeus as one of my favorites, not only because it is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius that is not only remembered for the great works of beautiful music he produced during his lifetime, but for his own self-destructiveness and his tragic death at a young age of 35, almost unnoticed in his lifetime due to the policies of some people, especially Saliere, played the Italian composer who was jealous of him. Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka .., since the director inevitably has pasted most scenes from the movie Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and are skeptical about that kind of movie Bollywood is boring day by day. The movie is a disaster, the two musicians in the movie give you no sense of being realistic, the movie is tasteless, meaningless and total error on all counts. The only person having influence is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, it all looks like a bunch of amateurs. The irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen in the film says that all characters in this movie are fictitious, and that any resemblance to someone is purely random, which is a blatant lie, because all similarities are very clear and they is very specific. I wish I could take Darshan and Co. to court not only for copyright infringement, but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art.
