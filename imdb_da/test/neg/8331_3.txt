The world now appears to be at a strange stage of cutback, where objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. Of course, it is much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not the case with theater screens, as is the case with IMAX, the vast, well-known theater system that has stunned the audience at the release and until today. As long as the material is right. <br /> <br /> The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D' is that it uses the big screen as its biggest advantage. It's boring, uninformative, and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspirational quotes from famous names like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Another problem with the movie is that it doesn't even take time to sit down and interview the lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience of being in the moon. Instead, the authors have simply pushed COPY and PASTE and hired famous voices such as Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton, and Matt Damon to imitate their famous quotes. This tactic is unintentionally repeated and boring. <br /> <br /> I would say without a moment's hesitation that I didn't learn a piece of information from the movie I didn't already know. <br /> <br /> And it repeatedly insisted on annoying crap out of me with its persistent sentimentality for much more than three minutes, it seems to be Tom Hank's voice to say something like "Without contributions from these brave men and women ... "Watching the movie is like seeing a bad advertisement. For forty agonizing minutes. <br /> <br /> 1/4
