My house mate and I stupidly bought the video of 'The Roller Blade Seven' from our local used video store in the hope of finding a bad movie to laugh at. This movie is not even ridiculous, it's pathetically bad, worse than Jack Frost 2, and it says something. The script, plays, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts, the actors have not even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or, in one case, actually having the lines read to them from sets and simply repeating them. Of course, in the post-apocalyptic 'Wheel Zone', the film consists of approximately 45 minutes of film, many of which have been edited poorly or repeatedly by various camera angles to make the movie longer. This becomes boring very quickly. The plot makes no sense about it (It is apparently a collection of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven of them, most are not on knives, they have roller boots and it seems to Me that for that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there are approx. 3 minutes female half in it. The writer and star Scott Shaw, of course, seems a bit of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very bad stunts and made up sword fighting that looks massive amateurish. Despite all this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional movie, because it really pushes the boundaries of modern filmmaking. My house companion and I were greeted by the entire trial, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the video tape, she has decided that it may be a kind of Ring-esquire video curse to be continued. If you see the video in the stores, take it from me! Leave well alone!
