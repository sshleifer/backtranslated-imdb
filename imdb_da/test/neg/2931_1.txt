I think this movie was a terrible waste of my time and I wanted to know after seeing it 5 times in class. This film does not show what has happened entirely in these times. No one can really say that these things happened to the letter. if anything the only good part would be the actors, even though they were really crap.the read the script without expression. pretty boring. I'd rather see a medical school. so i will definitely never see this movie again throughout my life. It is a complete waste of time unless you want your time to be wasted and if you want to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
