This movie will be resumed: Six in the 70's In a part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This movie does a bit of talking about sex in the 70s, with the exception of the focus on the hypersexual public and private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt that the manhole rod was symbolic of the actual sex in the 70s, and that kind of sex is much more widespread in the film. Don't miss me that time period looks like a blast. And it is quite important to document the scene to which the film refers. But in terms of calling this movie Sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. Technically, there is no Oscar Nominee, but the rune of it feels appropriate for the subject. Overall, an "eh."
