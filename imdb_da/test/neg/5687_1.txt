I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was hoping for a good movie. Oh well, had fun doing fun at the endless stretch of sand, eating camel ice cream (well, actually aubergine) and strange grimacing, which I think was about five actors. The DVD needs a director's comments so I can figure out what he was thinking ... or if he was at all. I can't believe they actually traveled to England, Austrialia and anywhere to film this ... could have been done anywhere. Would have been better if they had managed to get her naked. The best line in the movie? "He's waiting for his upgrades." "Yup, still waiting". Now it was fun! If anyone had more than 3 pages of dialogue (besides the narrator .... SKYD NEVER) then I see it again.
