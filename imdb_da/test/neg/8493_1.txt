I can only see how this movie came to be: <br /> <br /> "So how else can we turn our career up?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's take a movie that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We get B-grade actors who have half charisma and only want 10% of Carrey's original salary. We save millions and rakes at a huge profit, so remember no one wants to see a sequential sequel with none of the original actors who made it popular in the first place! We as leaders still believe that a movie was popular based on name and history, not the actors who did it in the first place! "Brilliant! Let's put a big budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!" And that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie trying to suck the life out of the original classic. <br /> <br /> But if the movie didn't include the words mask or something to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For everyone it is massive mistake and horrible acting, this will really appeal to children. It's a good natured girl who really wants to scream out "like me!" But only the 8 and younger will really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only one worth mentioning in this movie. He clearly tries to make the material play the desperate father, but the manuscript is so bad, the only thing that spits out that is worth it was my drink after seeing this. Loki's character also deserves a mention as he was the most pleasant character and truly one of the only reasons for older adults to watch this movie. It's too bad the charm is wasted on this movie, I would have really seen having seen the sign take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fit jokes and toilet humor at the end. <br /> <br /> The reason is so much of the books, I won't bother to mention this. It is so clear that even a Disney exec would be green with envy. Save your money, this is on its way to DVD for three months from the appearance of it. Shame on the studios again to smear a decent movie with a terrible sequel. Didn't they teach foolishly and stupidly?
