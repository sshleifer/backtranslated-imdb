What a waste of great-acting talent. It's a shame because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention others less well-known in America) there is a lot of dramatic talent to waste. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. Having enjoyed his "Kings and Queens" and this movie left me completely bored and frustrated at the point where I actually left before the movie ended. The film walked around its central story (involving Catherine Deneuve's disease) by becoming the sidetrack of every peripheral story and supporting character that appeared on the screen. The film also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters did not like each other so much (this was a story of family dysfunction), so the lack of coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (ranging from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream), as opposed to the emotional temperature of the movie, further immersed any feelings that the viewer should have felt at that time. The photograph (the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen, where our only sight is through a small opening that makes us feel as though we are looking through a kiglehole that expands), was also pretentious and invisible.
