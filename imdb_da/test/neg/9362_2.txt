This is a movie from Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is an indication of how smelly a movie is, it would be. I don't think I'm really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm chicken, but this year alone I haven't been really spooked by what's been offered so far, be it from the West or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, great prerequisite, but poor performance, dependent on clich√©d techniques (I think they are the only tools available to try) to try to evoke heartfelt moments. <br /> <br /> Se -jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman who once remarked that some apartments in the rental property opposite her are undergoing blackouts simultaneously at 9:56 am every day. No, she's not voyeur, but a number of inexplicable deaths in the neighborhood, including one she encounters on a subway, begin to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery of these deaths. <br /> <br /> With horror movies, there is always a pseudo-logical explanation in the movie about how the ghosts come. It's just about the most interesting thing that happens in the movie about the tearing of the "Truth", even though it won't take experienced film lovers to guess the plot halfway through. Of course, seeing this film makes it a very unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> There is a myriad of characters like a wheelchair-bound girl and the neighbors turning to look after her, as well as a school girl, detective, a mentally challenged boy, and a creepy train commuter. But, by genre formula, these people are usually as feed for death or, in this case, meaningless red herring characters whose only goal from the filmmakers is to mislead the audience, never remember if they cause or add a little to forward the plot. <br /> And don't get me started on the techniques used here. Fast cuts, sudden appearance, long hair gorges (ahhhhhh, so beware!) That can't move properly, plenty of blood as it flows down a mountain for free, and the list goes on. But the honor of sound engineers to create some perverted bone-dried sounds is used every time the spooks move, even though it resembles a one-pony pony. Don't waste time on this, even if you're a horror fan. It is a complete waste of a promising premise, and in the end you feel like you just went on a trip. A very long and painful endure. It is high time for something new in this genre, otherwise a movie will easily resemble another, with ugly long-haired monsters moving fun, but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and can anyone oil these doors while they are in it too.
