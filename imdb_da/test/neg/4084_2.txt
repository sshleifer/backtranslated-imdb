The only way I can feel good about passing those precious minutes into my life, tells every day how terrible it was. And even though I say it once a day, I won't quite get my point across every day for the rest of my life. Just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a difference in movies like this and films like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. The latter two were terrible, yes, but it was. Evan Almighty takes a strong throw and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... why God why All these people have much better talent now every time I see any of them, I think of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when I watched the movie, which was a mentally challenged elderly woman who believed that the poop's block and smash-by-tools- Mens-joke jokes were so funny that she didn't stop laughing all the time and almost stroked several times.
