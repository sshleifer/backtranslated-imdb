My first question is not about the terrible play, not the horrible writing, it's the director. The choices made about filmography are some of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Why should every stupid die in slow motion? I was about to hit myself with a rubber hose. The camera's shots do it so you can't see what's going on. I was about to turn off the movie because of Jalal Merhi's accent, as it made it to the sex scene, so I thought it might get better, it didn't do well. If you are considering special effects on an A, B, C rating scale, would I have to put it around a W or so, and I mention the actor? Wow, it was bad !!! And the WORST part of the whole "Expect to DIE" experience is the obvious abuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "THE MATRIX GETS YOU DEADLINE". Comparing this movie to the Matrix is ​​easily the WORST comparison I have ever seen. If you haven't seen this movie, don't, unless you're looking for a good reason to turn your head against the wall.
