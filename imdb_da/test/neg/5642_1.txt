It doesn't surprise me that the decision makers in this hopeless movie couldn't find a British distributor, and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. Distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper couldn't say it was a movie that just wouldn't recover its costs. Since it is a thriller of puzzles, it would have helped if they had chosen a leading actor who could speak correctly, rather than the mumbling Vinnie Jones who seems to pronounce "riddle" as "rial". And it would have helped if the dialogue had not been flooded with noisy places or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: The lost Charles Dickens story helps our heroes solve a series of modern murders, but it would also be a copy of Herge's Adventures Of Tintin, as the link between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than foolish. And we have the ridiculous assumption that an investigative journalist who puts his hands on a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript would take several days to read it, just because flashbacks to Dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie as if they had some connection to it. As they do not. I mean, if you found a new Dickens manuscript, wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it? The movie ends with one of the surprising revelations that have become mandatory since The Sixth Sense, but in this case it is not so surprising that you insult your intelligence. If the movie suddenly turns supernatural in the 12th hour, reveals that Vinnie Jones is a robot, it could have been more acceptable. It couldn't have seemed so tedious if the movie was stylish, but it is not. And in several places it seems to be a particular amateur: There is a scene where a table is laid with a 60's spring-cut technique, but they have not ensured that the person who actually puts the table is completely out of the frame between the cuts. Therefore, you can see things that change at the edge of the frame when you really have to see things changing in the middle of the frame. A good rule in film making is: If you don't understand how to make a technique, try something else. The real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place.
