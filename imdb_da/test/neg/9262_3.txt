Extremely slow movie. There are good performances from all actors, why over 5 scores. Surya and Jyo must be this ideal man and wife and we are shown this until it comes to a point you start asking, is there a story. One day, Jyo Surya discovers the diary to find his failed college love story. College love story is quite convincing as Surya is an arrogant senior who always chooses Bhoomika, beats her friend, shouts to her publicly and despite being afraid of him she falls in love with him. Even after that, he continues to dominate her using raw language. I certainly couldn't appreciate the soft character that Bhoomika played, I don't think any self-respecting woman would fall into such jerks in real life. Jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after it's climax. The story is extremely weak in its characters. An extremely arrogant Surya to Bhoomika is the exact opposite to Jyo (and there is no reason for the sudden change in character). Getting a very gentle Bhoomika becomes a great extrovert when she returns. If she had become so confident, why did she not try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone.
