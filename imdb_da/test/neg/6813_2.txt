After reading the reviews, I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I don't think I know enough about Bach music, and the comments were not enough for me to understand the meaning or music that was played. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be advisable for guidance from a Bach music expert to explain the movie. <br /> <br /> I was really trying to watch movie hopping that I could enjoy at least some of it, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk.
