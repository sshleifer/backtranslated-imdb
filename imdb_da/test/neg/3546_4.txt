Matthew Aldrich. This is a name that is worth remembering. This is the person who took their fingers on the keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts from time to time. Clich√©. Predictable. An insult to the public's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only recipient of the blame? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this scary excuse for a script and made it a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read (or not) and chose to star in it. Culpability abounds. <br /> <br /> These are Denise Richards movie writings. There is not enough Razzies in the universe to properly acknowledge how truly horrible this writing is. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly novel, and the way it is presented is extremely creative, but at the end of the day it's just tailor-made. Pretty trimmings. <br /> <br /> Pack what you want - Writing is still garbage writing.
