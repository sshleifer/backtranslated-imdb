This movie is a proof you can't just go to a Redbox and read the descriptions of movies and choose one and try it. <br /> <br /> While giving them big credit for making a movie with half-way decent special effects on such a low budget and at least half decent script and story line ... unfortunately it was only that: halfway decent. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things go It is not completely wrapped and does not mind low budget effects, you like this movie. Honestly it wasn't really my cup of tea. I just had to go to bed instead of spending my time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better science-fiction movie produced on an even lower budget (!) See a "Primer".
