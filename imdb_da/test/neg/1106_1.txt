I generally love this type of movie. But this time I found myself wanting to kick the screen. Since I can't do that, I just want to complain about it. This was quite idiotic. The things that happen to the dead children are very tough, but the living people are absolute idiots. I'm an adult man, pretty big, and I can defend myself well. But I wouldn't do half of the things the little girl does in this movie. Also, the mother in this movie is ruthless with her children, to the point of neglect. I wish I was not so angry with her and her actions because otherwise I would have had the pleasure. What a number she was, take my advice and quickly forward through everything you see her until the end. Also, someone who gets sick of watching movies filmed so dark. Another one can hardly see what is being filmed. As an audience, we are not involved in the actions on the screen. So then why the hell can't we have night vision?
