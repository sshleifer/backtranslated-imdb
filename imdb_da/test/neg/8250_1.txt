So many fans, so little to show for it. I know I know these words will find me in a large minority. Many people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously, kind, good filmmaking, not even close, and let's blame it where it belongs ... in the writing. Now I know they won an oscar for that, and boy did they look good on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of curse in it and a slightly larger budget. What this movie shows is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take fertilizer, feed it to you and make you believe in your eating beans. And that was exactly what the studio did with the movie. They created such a high-pitched buzz around it that people believed in, and would believe it so much - that they saw shine where no one was. <br /> <br /> Now I know some people that it's a good movie, I don't think it's a terribly bad movie, I can compare it with more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some amazing made for TV movies (although not HBO movies, HBO movies are exceptionally better than Good Will Hunt would ever be.) It's just a nice little movie, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good at what they gave him just oscar the reason it was itching to do it for a while. And of course, Miramax secured the PR machine Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar ... but came a people ... there are better movies out there that are GWH.
