I love the book. It's full of passion, romance, excitement ... and the movie coincides with two spunky stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a big star in Australia who had starring in neighbors and released her first single. The decision to throw her in The Delinquents was definitely a marketing grip. It didn't pay for me. <br /> <br /> Kylie could have been great in neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play the celebrating Lola ... and she was not of Asian descent as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> The movie was pretty boring. It struck, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on Kylie and was generally quite disappointing.
