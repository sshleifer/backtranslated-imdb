I must blame myself, but surely I expected more from a movie titled "Black Dragons" and about secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This movie is a boring failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which is basically pretty brilliant and exciting), becomes only clear during an exploration at the end, but the problem is that you stop caring for a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates into a community of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed just before World War II and ?? especially after witnessing the end ?? It's certainly a prerequisite with lots of potential, so it's pretty shame it isn't elaborated more properly. However, there is a great dialogue that I cannot resist sharing! Man against woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So I can turn you up? That's the only way you want to leave this place!" It's the only highlight in a very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is lovely ?? as usual ?? But his spooky performance alone is hardly worth buying this movie. If you are interested in seeing other ghoulish performances by his (in decent screen films), check out "Invisible Ghost", "The Corpse Vanishes", "White Zombie" and of course the 1931 Dracula version.
