Komodo vs Cobra starts as 'One Planet' environmental scientist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hires Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, first Stoddard is reluctant since the island is a secret military research base, but soon changes when a lot of money is offered. Along with the television news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey), they sailed to the island, and when they were landed, it was found that the military has financed illegal DNA genetic experiments that have resulted in huge Komodo Dragon's & King Cobras, who have eaten almost every other living thing & Stoddard & co is next on the menu ... Co-written and directed by the always horrible Jim Wynorski during his Jay Andrew's pseudonym this is just awful, it's just pretty hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual waste 'Creature Features', the Sci-Fi Channel has nerve to air, if possible. The scripture is horrible, predictable, and completely boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists crushing with DNA, a group of people are trapped with those monsters and are trying to escape being eaten. That's what it's all about Komodo vs Cobras plot, maybe this tried to tear off AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) titled, but all 'vs.' bit equivalent is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the end, boring as hell and surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to get a full on monster mash. The character is bad, the dialogue is horrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable, and Cliché ridden & the whole movie really sucks with a lazy script that mistakenly says that both Komodo Dragon's & Cobras are amphibious they are not. Hell, Komodo vs Cobra is not even worth watching for unintentional laughs as it is so boring and almost never happens, although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from Cobra is quite fun for those wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski continue to lead a job? He's probably consistently the worst instructor currently working, how can he continue to have fun sound movies put in beautiful places with half decent casts and still churn out such a horrible movie? I think this was cut to get a PG or because it's TV viewing since every time someone swears, it's masked by a parrot squeak! There are zero gore or violence and the monsters' scenes are lukewarm, people are just kind of stand there, the monsters are just kind of stands there also hovering or roaring and it's about it. The effects of the CGI computer are terrible, these are really bad things that just look awful. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 450,000, it looks as cheap as it was, the Hawaiian sites are nice to look at, but that's about it. The action is poor from an uninterested look. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs Cobra is a truly horrific Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' by Jim Wynorski, movie doesn't get much worse than this.
