This movie is such a total waste of time. I can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of waste. Oh, I would have loved it when I was seven years old. I think a seven-year-old child might have written and corrected it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, no action, just a nonsense. The best actor is that of the games. I think I could whip these ninjas, and I'm not someone you want to consider hard. Completely unconvincing and does not spark the slightest interest. I walk and laugh at the end of the first ten minutes of the movie. This is one that would turn people away from martial arts films. Great comedy, bad action flick.
