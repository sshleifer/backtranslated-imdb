Movie critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the film-making public so they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. But my decision to see "The Cat in the Hat" was not made by chance. You see three years ago that all of you critics said that we should all avoid the "accident" known as "How Grinch Stole Christmas". Then some of my friends took me to see it, and it turned out to be a colorful, fun and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. So when the critics released their rage against "The Cat in the Hat", another big budget Seuss updated with a big name star in the title role, I thought it should be the same old song. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> For five minutes, I thought I was ready. The opening points are clever, the kids are charming and the production values ​​are top notch. Then the cat showed up. There are many issues from this point on, but the biggest was the much miscasting of Mike Myers. Where "The Grinch" was rescued by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, "The Cat" was destroyed by Myers. He can be very fun when his energies are used where they belong, comics. Every movie he made was really fun, was really just a feature-length comedy sketch, from "Wayne's World" to "Austin Powers". So he's trying to do the same here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff they hold at the end of SNL, not fun, just painful. Not that the authors helped him with anything. After the charming prologue, the film becomes an hour's offensive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insulting stunted attempts at hip humor. This movie was the most disappointing cinematic experience I've ever had. Period. So much talent and work went into something so silly. I know the adult stars in this movie will be relatively rude to this mess, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning get more chances to show their charm in much better movies. If you are a parent, avoid this as the plague. With movies like "Elf" and "Brother Bear" currently in theaters, you have far better choices.
