A child-like puppeteer, for a children's greeting to the public's access, goes over the deep end when he discovers children he is entertaining in a hospital were victims of terrible abuse. This movie has some of the worst indescribable monstrous parents you could ever come across. Not an exploitation film as much as an after-school especially about the dangers of child abuse. Apparently, harmless, Mr Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it appears that the police have been neutralized by the lack of evidence to judge illegal parents about their terrible assault on their children. The children are numb and zombie-like (because of the amount of abuse inflicted on them), the parents high, unthinkable hard, despicable and belligerent. The mothers in particular are so indecent, you will root for their execution. They are essentially miserable people who take their frustrations out on the kids. Our detectives are a tired mass, frustrated by the whole legal process, how the police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who submit their children to submission. While the crimes themselves are hideous, the film does not explicitly elaborate on the pig's activity on the screen. I would say that the reason for seeing this is for Tom Basham's performance as the unbalanced human child slipping into psychosis. There is quite a strange dinner sequence between Basham's Mr. Rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child, about how he lives in a fantasy, and how what he has just done has left an indelible mark. .notice the changes in behavior, pretty impressive work, going from innocent to spooky). Peter Renaday is Lt. Hayes, the detective who is in charge of the murder, and expresses on his face the burden it takes on him. There is an early performance by John Ashton as detective Matthews, who always raises Hayes' honor because of his inability to follow the instructions, not to mention how he believes parents are abusing their children. Creepy casual bluesy score that seems inappropriate for a movie like this. Controversial conclusion that even children can only tolerate so much. A little too slow to move to my taste, but there is an effective use I felt about Basham's eyes before he takes care of the business and waits patiently when he prepares to strike.
