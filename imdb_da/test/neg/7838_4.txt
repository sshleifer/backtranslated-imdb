Jean Claude Van Damme's film career seems to have gone to hell in a hand card, so how ironic to see him play a character that matches the same fate in a literal way at the beginning of the movie! It is also interesting to note how much, much like the films in his movie are, regardless of who the producer, director or screenwriter is. Van Damme usually plays a character who lives in France, because of a number of circumstances he finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies, and it is up to Van Damme to get revenge helped by a characters he has just met. Look at AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other movies titled "Starring Jean Claude Van Damme" and they all have almost the same type of story structure. This does not mean that they are of course just very similar, and if you have seen a Van Damme movie, you have pretty much seen them all. It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK
