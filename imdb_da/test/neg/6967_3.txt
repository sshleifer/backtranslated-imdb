As many know, this movie is the debut of Edward D. Wood Jr. as a writer / producer / instructor / actor. I've been a fan of Ed Wood for several years now. Although I do not like this as much as some of his other films, it was probably the greatest insight into the cinematic public getting Wood from his life. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This movie is about changing one's sex and how to be a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. This movie is far ahead of its time to handle this topic and how it is about it. However, the film still contains Wood's usual pitfalls of poor dialogue, meaningless stock footage and hokey special effects. Throw in Wood's usual overdose of Bela Lugosi hamming it up and you have Woods first attempt to be director. The reason is that a police visit goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems in this direction. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can't bring herself to tell her about his secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan, who undergoes a sex change because he really is more suited to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of continuous comment to what is going on (Lugosi's part is really not well-defined and most likely, Wood has a star in his movie and Lugosi to get some cash). All in all, the film shows the characteristics of Wood's career. It was of course shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown quite randomly. It certainly has "it's so bad it's good" feel it. But I must applaud Ed for his progressive thinking in making this movie. Transvestitism and gender change were not extremely open issues in the early 50s. Wood took great risk of making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexually deviant and put a more human face on the cross.
