I hate to admit it, but they were entitled to take down Schrader. The opportunity is here to create an atmosphere for drawing an audience in a movie. It wasn't finished. The signs are weak. History was weak. The management was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I have seen it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redemption feature. But no, nothing. The next phase is likely to be a remake of the original, or hopefully it will be left well alone. Anyone who wants to know what the best successor to The Exorcist was, was to read "Legion," written by Blatty, it should be the best follow-up on an original piece that is required to print. Unfortunately, it was not translated to screen very well, and I doubt it could ever be. As for Dominion, begin. Avoid at all costs.
