A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on the ear must be fun, romantic and easy-to-live. Instead, this film is about things that are not said and not expressed, so it comes to the point where you are grateful, whatever is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the issue that says the most is the least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But the two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some real people. END OF SPOILER Capshaw gets the job of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful. As I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand it is an element of life and love, but I also don't want to see a movie about it, at least not this one. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it at all, despite the very talented cast left to do it.
