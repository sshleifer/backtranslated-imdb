I watched this movie about 8 years ago when it first came out and the only memories I have about it are: 1. That it was terrible. 2. That in one scene Linnea Quigley uses sun-tanned lotion for her arms and legs repeatedly for approx. 15 minutes straight (it seemed so long anyway). 3. A scene where a character gets a sledgehammer hit into his head. In this scene, when the hammer connects, the head smashes like glass. It's pretty bad.
