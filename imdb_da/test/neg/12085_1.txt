If I heard the male leader say "This is madness!" Once again I would have barfed. The movie is a great clich√©, with false "drop him under your heel" attitudes. Not a man in this movie has a redeeming quality; reminds me of Soviet earmuffs with highly politically oriented messages. I couldn't even understand why there was attraction between the managers, nor could I wait for the end.
