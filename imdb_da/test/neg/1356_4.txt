Insane really. Although you haven't seen the original George Cukor movie with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars, you can reject this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What has she done for herself? Her face can hardly move. It alone puts her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening was to sue DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses without a connection in the public's subconscious are trying to pass on to friends, absolutely compelling. Eva Mendes in the Joan Crawford section is a monstrous piece of miscasting. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a transgender without any taste or subtlety. Bizarre to think that a woman adapted and instructed these women. The only positive things I can mention are a short but very fun look of Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as a housekeeper.
