This is certainly a "lesser known" comedy card from the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD of Kino Films with non-Laurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but also generally average below the average for the movie. Compared to the shorts of Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor. Also the accompanying music was pretty bad by the standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound because of the music's insufficiency to set the right mood. But despite this, they are still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I must be honest about this brief. It was the last of 8 on this DVD, and when I got there, I was pretty sorry about the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts. So it is possible that the movie may be a little better than a 4 - but certainly if this is the case, no better than a 5! The film is a beautiful standard card about an incompetent bellboy. Nothing particularly interesting and there are probably very quiet quiet shorts out there.
