I've never been a big fan of Almodovar, but generally I've always found something to enjoy in his movie. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something to enjoy in Broken Embraces, as I would normally think I would. <br /> <br /> I find the biggest mistake in Broken Embraces to be the signs and the lack of depth they show. The film is essentially a love story, one that is tragic, and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. I found this problematic from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our 'hero' director / screenwriter, Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. His agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves. In the opening scene, our 'hero' director / screenwriter, Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman whom he has just met. His agent comes in and rolls his eyes as the woman bashfully leaves. Mateo chats about having to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. After being blinded by a tragic car accident that also killed his 'true' love Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer might be able to buy into this concept unless the rest of the film really never illustrates why Lena was the love of her life or any depth to his character or any other. Cruz plays Lena, the mistress of an industry named Ernesto Martel. From the start, their union is rather pathetic, as Martel connects jealousy to Lena, and Lena avoids uncertainty about being alone by living with the very older Martel. To jump further, Martel finances a movie to Mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the movie, Lena. Of course, Lena and Mateo fall in love with no narrative. And in Almodovar's world, it's really that simple. Mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Mateo falls in love with Lena, later it is obvious that he had a son with his agent after their love affair. Her son reacts to this information with a laugh and one, "Oh, good." Again, no depth, no understanding of any of these signs, it just happens. From the start of the movie to the end, I got no depth of emotion from Mateo. He is flat and does not seem much different from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> The one scene I enjoy was when the movie producer Martel sees video footage, which his son recorded under cover of making a documentary from Mateo. There is well a moment when Martel looks obsessively as a lip reading confirming his worst fear. Later Lena confronts Martel when he looks at the footage and speaks her part loudly and corresponds to the video footage of her lips as she speaks. Some quite brilliant moments. Instead, confronted, but still really fascinating. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the rest of the movie, I left a little bored. I couldn't care less about these characters or their situations, so no wisdom on Almodovar's part can make up for this lack of depth. I think if you are a fan of his work, you will enjoy this movie, but if you are like me, then you will discover it is missing.
