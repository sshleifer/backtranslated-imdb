If you're a sane person and you've seen movies before, you can't tolerate this piece of idiocity for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay longer, it won't be because you would expect akshay or paresh (not govinda thank you!), But because you value your money too much and you will at least have a short nap on the lavish space in the multiplex unlike the money they robbed you of! It's hard to believe that the instructor who gave us a cult movie like HeraPheri can fall to such levels .. okay he's repetitive, but now he comes out of all third rates and expects us to laugh because he's brought in Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No, sir, it is not possible to work now ... especially with this silly script of yours! Even comedy movies can have meaningful scripts (Make Raho Munnabhai anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda doesn't have much to do, can't comment. Akh Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal blew some of the worst joke possible. Lara Dutta had the real opportunity to perform in this one, but otherwise she fails ... the only highlight of the movie (possibly) is Tanushree's play! But she's only there for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie is worth more space ... (probably not even so much!). So finally warning - don't look at it!
