Hi, Everyone, Oh, boy ... This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music when they can push it in. There are three bad guys that I think are the stars here. They turn people up and cut people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. Common things. <br /> <br /> The woman sending them on their missions cannot move her mouth when she speaks. It's like seeing a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walks as she balances an egg on her head. The wardrobe is the 70's leisure style for men and blahene for the female leader who must be a good nurse. The bad novocain mouthwash has red. A silk frock maybe, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that's too big. <br /> <br /> I really liked the end, though it didn't make much sense. It lets us know what happened earlier in the movie. <br /> <br /> Police officers are ok. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright ones could have worked again in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The movie starts interesting enough and ends with a surprise. Between sucks. The guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a 1940s character actor. Great voice. <br /> <br /> This is a little too long. The lady with marble in her mouth had only had a few lines, and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> Her sword scene could have been handled by a trained mirror. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
