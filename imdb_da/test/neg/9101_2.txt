This movie tries very hard to be an "action" movie, but it doesn't fail. <br /> <br /> Steve Guttenberg plays the head of an elite anti-terrorist team that fails (?) in an attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent. <br /> <br /> The story ... the actor ... the special effects ... ALL CASES FLAT !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely one must be avoided! !!!
