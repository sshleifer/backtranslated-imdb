A pre-Nerd Robert Carradine, a pre-Automan Desi Arnaz Jr., and an almost pre-pubescent Melanie Griffith heading to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon fishermen. Well, their dream is about as exciting as this noisy youth road movie. They are not very interesting, and the film doesn't have much of a point beyond `We got together some of the well-known people's alley and made a low budget film about their misadventures. 'Out of the canon in the 60s and 70s roadmaps and rebellious youth films, this is mediocre under-developed, non-involved characters, not very white, not much freshness to the story, which is as bland as the muddy landscape of the movie. <Br /> <br /> But for those who worry - they go to Alaska, and apparently Alaska was like the wild west of the 70's because everyone wears a gun and is rough and dried. Robert Carradine says charming things like `I hope we can find a shower, my nuts are wise. (And he's the one with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly robbed and forced to work, and the local bigwig, their employer, puts the moves on Melanie and eventually burns Desi for not being corrupted. It is when they are not wise and do not leave the city, instead of eating dog food or going hungry, being knocked out of the boys, and then taking a joyride in the bigwigs car. The last half of the movie leaves the wicked bigwig when the trio commits a robbery, embarks on a hatchery, and so forth. The movie is just ending, annoying and ambiguous, but looks like they have no trouble getting much character development and history in the first place, it's pretty appropriate. Worth to see if you really are in low budget 70's fare, but ultimately pretty forgettable.
