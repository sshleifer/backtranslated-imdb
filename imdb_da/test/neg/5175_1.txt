I'm a big fan of British movies in general, but especially gangster movies. Unfortunately, this movie was shockingly bad. I think it's pretty depressing that this movie gets some good customer reviews. The idea that this movie is gritty and realistic is ridiculous. I have read and heard fist hands right about the real life events shown in this movie, and they have almost all been glorified over the top violence, etc. The only gritty true to life event in the whole movie was the Range Rover killings where some Overblown bouncers got rubbed off to boast with people they couldn't handle. This movie is a disgrace to British cinema! It has no plot and no decent action and just trust to be violent (gritty and realistic as some people like to say it). The kind of people who made this movie shouldn't be allowed to get near a budget or movie camera just as the people's movie is about, shouldn't be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of any consequence.
