My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when I saw the movie had the same director as Independence Day and godzilla. The special effects of the Independence Day were much better than in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateur look, as the special effects were from a movie made in the 60s. I didn't see the whole movie. When it was played for approx. one hour, I switched off my DVD player. I watch 3 movies almost every night, and I have never gone away from a movie, even though it was so boring. The only good thing about this movie was the beautiful sheriff :) So I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So don't see this, instead you have to go out and rent Starship Troopers, it's just like 10,000 times better.
