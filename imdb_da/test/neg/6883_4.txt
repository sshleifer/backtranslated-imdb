It's hard to comment on this movie. It is one of the few films that Dimension has not actually paid off (it's hard to come up with a reason why) and it was rushed into an unimpressive 500 theaters, it's the opening day. Perhaps Dimension was afraid of how people would react to a swamp creature using its tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is only a tow truck driver until he rescues a Voodoo priestess from a bad car accident and, in turn, is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowning. By morning Ray comes back to life and closes a group of teenagers who witness the terrible crash that occurs. <br /> <br /> What brings this movie down, it's paper-thin characters. I didn't care for a moment about any of them. The dialogue was also less than hum. It was also very predictable. Characters made the typical stupid horror movie character things that check out creaky sounds, call people's names, and walk on a rock while chasing. I could also immediately choose who the final girl would be. And why did the camera have these fast white flashes when someone died or when the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What's good? Now, there is an impressive excitement scene where the killer goes under the sponge to get to his victims and a tense sequence, where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer is watching. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's another August / September disappointment. I was looking forward to it, but I didn't get what was expected.
