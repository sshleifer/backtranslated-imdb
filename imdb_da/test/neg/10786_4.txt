Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are great actors. But this movie was badly written. First of all, Irons is put in comfort chair in his chair during the hijack scene ... he seems to be READING something, and also quiet too! Maybe the director shot the actor between takes? The violence in the hijacking was also a big disappointment. Slowly, spheres fly - how his wife and daughter are killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost. His grieving wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "avenge" and talk to all his journalistic friends and ambassadors (he's a journalist for the heavy economist rag) and see and see, they actually give him tips on where to find the evil ones! How do they know? But what really made me turn off the movie halfway was when the rays of light found their way into a warehouse where evil hangs out - but not the kills that killed his wife - and they beat anyway. So he's just a killer. He comes away and well ... I shut it down. I think I couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything, and I also thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers. Instead, he goes after their friends, I think, or who hangs out in department stores and leaves automatic weapons lying around. The excitement was just quite conventional, and the dialogue was poor ("it's ok son, crying helper," he says to his son. Son says "no it doesn't" and Dad says "you're right .. I don't." "Irons take questionable roles - like the same dragon film he did. He was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, which is a very different animal than this lukewarm thriller.
