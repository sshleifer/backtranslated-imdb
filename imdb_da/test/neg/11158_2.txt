End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. Muddling-direction, winding script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, quick-fire MTV-style editing and bad action altogether. <br /> <br /> That is not to say the end of days cannot be seen. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest act flickering ridiculously to be so scary and stupid when it comes to logic. Without logical feeling, the movie dies faster, so the End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after its opening in the United States <br /> <br /> I won't go into the details explaining why the end of days violates the law about movie logic, but here are several issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the devil goes out, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. No snapper finger, no engineer energized to ignite the fire, nothing. How could this happen? Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically come up with the name "Christine York" after examining the phrase "Christ in New York" cut on a victim's body, running the database on the computer and the viola Christine York, the only person with the exact name throughout New York City! In addition to my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters that came into contact with Arnold's character face him later in the movie? I laughed aloud when I recognized the good grandmother, who was a madman, is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that movie to this was absolutely fun if you could imagine. <br /> <br /> All the rarely big explosions and fires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle? The devil took a man's body of flesh and blood, but he is invisible to spheres and explosions by healing through the body. Logically, this is impossible. As the devil dampens the illusion of the apartment, Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree, which is supposedly an illusion and physically falling * on it. <br /> <The devil is able to knock out the person's brain and twist a victim's head 180 degrees, but he could not kill Arnold's character as he always wants. <br /> <br /> How the devil's object to the lust of parents died and why the evil New Yorkers were driving after Arnold and the purpose of desire was never explained. <br/> <br /> In the order that there is a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the Devil's desire to escape the subway took off the wreck of short distance intact. This is beyond my understanding, as the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of light around violently and die from deadly wounds seconds after influence. Arnold suffers the brutal blow of the mob sanctioned by the devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, but the devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, the devil took over a man's body, suddenly Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is this a case or just an example of poor editing? Arnold's view of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly ridiculous scenes like "YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!" is the perfect feed for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line "You are the baggage!" <br /> <br /> The whole theory of 666/1999 is actually ridiculous. Then the pseudo-religious babble is about the Christian theology that involves the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the devil's desire for desire. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is very ironic that the End of Days uses the scattered profans who abuse the deity while wandering about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and cruel, and it is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director's indulgence of profits is a factor here. He probably doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the scriptwriter of Air Force One, who was only obliged to write the script just for a large amount of money. Therefore, the end of days is a worthless movie without redeeming value except for campiness - Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
