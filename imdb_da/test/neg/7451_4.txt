This movie started wonderfully; The first 30 minutes are very fun and clever with some interesting characters. That's the good news. The bad news is that the film then becomes too repetitive and then it just gets stupid. <br /> <br /> What we win is a Santa Claus with "magic" powers with a lot of New Age baloney cast in the mix. It's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "Christmas movie" I would expect from Jim Varney's "Ernest". To be fair, it still has a decent amount of laughs and is profanity-free, but not just a movie I could recommend.
