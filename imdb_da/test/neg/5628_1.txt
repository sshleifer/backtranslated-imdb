Famous as the British movie so bad that it had to be given away for free with a newspaper, the quality of this underwear movie fund "thriller" can be guessed from the abnormal number of 10/10 voices it gets and the large number of rave reviews from posters without posting history and no other reviews for their name. The solid people know what that means, the happy can be fooled. If they dip into this, they will not last long before it pulls them down. Technically inappropriate with the boom coming in shot or the reflections of the crew visible, it just goes on forever in a forgetful sub-DAVINCI CODE of $ 5 a day. The end is just insulting but quiet. It's not like you get it that far!
