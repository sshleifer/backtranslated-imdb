I've seen this movie several times, it's probably one of the cheapest action flicks in the eighties. So I think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across it. But if you are in big waste, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (McNamara Twins) are sporty mustache and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of them gets shot in the leg and still kicks his enemies into the nirvana. This movie is really awful, but then it's a good party tape again!
