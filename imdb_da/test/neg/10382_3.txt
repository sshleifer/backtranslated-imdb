This movie just seemed to lack direction. The reason developed so many twists in such a short time that it seemed to lose anything from what the true story was. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and seemed like writing was hurried and a little too wandering. Exorcise scenes and possession history began to take a back seat to the character's back stories (which were a little weak at first). All in all, I would skip it unless you rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven't seen before. You are much better off just looking at the exorcist or the exorcism of Emily Rose.
