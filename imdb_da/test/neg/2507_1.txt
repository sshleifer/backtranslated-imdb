The opening was a steal from "Eight-legged Freaks", a movie that is all this is not. Quiet and pedestrian are the words that apply - along with others who cannot be repeated ..! Drifter type returns to his home (?) Town, meets with old friends etc .... the usual annoying child, single mother, local loudmouth and so on. Boat special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, hi director see "Close meetings"?). Good play? Good story? Good camera angles? Good cutting? Not here! Don't rent unless you share the cost and have a lot of beer handy. Don't watch TV, go and drink a lot of beer instead - you will enjoy it more!
