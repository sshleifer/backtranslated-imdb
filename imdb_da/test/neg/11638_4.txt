Made with the film store back from the production of Nana, 1927's Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday movie for everyone concerned, and that is the best way to look at it. Jean Renoir never seems to have thought enough about editing the footage together. The reason is a simple conversion of racial stereotypes? in 2028, a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris, where a white native girl teaches him Charleston (of course she assumes she is a wild whose dance is a prelude to her eating him before he enters the seductive kind of "White Aborigine" music). There are lots of surreal features, whether it's the pet gorilla who eats flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, the angels girl phones (Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger among them) or the fact that the black performer Johnny Huggins plays his role in minstrel blackface while Hessling's dance ability is almost completely non-existent and there are some interesting occasional slow motion experiments, but maintaining it to two wheels is not really enough. An extra air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this quiet musical has absolutely no score on Lions Gate's new DVD?
