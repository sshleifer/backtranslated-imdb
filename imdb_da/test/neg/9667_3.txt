There is something strange about the antisocial mood you can find in any Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, I often want more songs these days began that way. But in this excuse for a video show, the duo stunts us videos for four songs from their album at the moment, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over in the opening credits, where an anonymous producer describes the record as being a news record that just takes place on the charts. Unfortunately, this open voice-over seam is hit right on your head. <br /> <br /> Most RIAA-approved music recordings seem to adhere to a rule to put the best material early in the album. Often when you get past the first song, the discerning listener notices that the recording has suffered if it is something to keep their attention. Bands who defied the mainstream convention often saved their best material at last, or at least spread it evenly throughout the disc. In this case, Cheech And Chong seems to have decided to uncover their bets. The Get Out Of My Room opening piece is a hilarious theme song with an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of a 1980 music video find the dull direction somewhat nostalgic. Cheech's perception of British punk is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Wherever it goes downhill is the second number I'm not at home right now. Nothing kills interest in a song like repetition, and it's hard to get more repetitive than this responsive. You really feel the urge to hit Cheech in the face and tell him that we get the idea, he is not at home right now, so please go ahead. The next song, along with the theme of love is a weird thing, is the absolute rock bottom not only for this collection but for Cheech And Chong in general. It's almost like this song was made for the sole reason to elaborate on the album's life. Fortunately, Stoner Duo finally saved the best, but it is also curious to note that Chong is completely absent from this cut. Born in East L.A. is a simple figure based on the old Bruce Springsteen number that mocks Reagan's view of multiculturalism. As reigned by Cheech's narrative, one must wonder how many poor schleps who could not speak a Spanish word were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not linens. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985, and so is today. If that's something, it's got worse, so you have to wonder what Born In East LA would be if it was written in the current era. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two cuts do not make an album, especially when there is so much dull filler between them. The interviews before Get out of my room, for example, are pretty funny. Not unparalleled as much of up in smoke, but fun enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, the two intermediate songs are reflected in their recording of recordings. Drilling song makes dull filler. If you cut the middle half hour of material from this video, you would have something significantly better. <br /> <br /> Out of my room I gave out three out of ten. They are earned by the first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they were thinking.
