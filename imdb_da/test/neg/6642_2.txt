There are many mysteries in life. For example: Why was anyone other than Carrot Top agreeing to appear in this movie? Why did anyone distribute this movie? Why did any money pay to see it? I suppose none of these issues will ever be answered, but one thing I know for sure is this movie one of the worst ever made with a budget so big. It would already be bad, but the addition of Carrot Top's "humor" makes it even worse. The only entertainment you could get from this movie is to burn it, smash it or destroy it in a fun way. If you were to rank it against any movie ever made, it would be just between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Nuff said.
