Why is it that Instant Noodles are not instantaneous, it was the confusing problem I put in the lap of one legged anger Sherpa; he just retorted that noodles were not his bag, so I replied "What bag?" He looked further confused. <br /> <br /> Some of you will wonder why Sherpa has only a lower appendage. <br /> <br /> Sherpa, whom we call Sherpa 5, for data protection reasons, injured his toe. "How!?!" I hear you ask, I will continue as we learned from the review of Donkey Punch (2002) Irene via sly nudges and dirty waves, etc. Tried in vain to teach the little traits of checkers to all the angry Sherpas. Sherpa 5, which is known only for its violent tyrants against major democratic presidents in the now revolutionary years of now the United States, and it has implications for the mind set of its people in the postmodern empire that now exists through invasions from countries less than that transported away in a flood of water due to his lack of understanding of checkers. According to an eyewitness, he jumped around like a feckless banjo string by Mardi gras, which brought a stick of nails through it. After the match, which resulted in 5 llamas, each was found to miss their left testicles, 3 Sherpas were spooning under a gooseberry bush and Sherpa 5 had the nail fixed in his big toe. <br /> <br /> A Sherpa's lifestyle is as modest as a nun, with only 15,000 ft. of rudimentary health facilities. Consequently, when the first aid was opened, only one IOU was found for a tin spam, and some fragile knickers were found. Sherpa 5 jumped around like a dark on a nose in pain until Irene jumped out like a cock from a hen house and suggested he kill his suffering in the llama saliva. Sherpa 5 agreed on the procedure to reassure him, a bottle of 100-year-old Glenfiditch was produced, some saying it was left by an angry Scotsman who is considered an ancestor of the angry Sherpa. One under the influence was the toe bent to the ridges, dressed with irene's slightly dirty membrane and a little blue tack. Some of you may feel that this procedure would not make Sherpa any good, and you would be fully committed to holding that view. Only four days later it was a gangster, and a week later the leg was removed using even closer elastic bands
