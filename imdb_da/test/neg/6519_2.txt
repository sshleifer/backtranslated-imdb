This movie tries to deposit the success of Richard Curtis movies, especially "Love Actually" (which I loved) - a variety of scenes that follow the love of different couples. <br /> <br /> It is a good idea that is poorly executed. The script tries to be a little too clever and simply does not resonate. Most of the play is stolen, which more reflects the director than the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on a plane) was called "Scenes from a Park", which is a more appropriate title as not all scenes were of a "sexual nature". <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie, but in the end it is disappointing. Do not want to.
