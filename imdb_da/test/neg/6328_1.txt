I caught this movie on sennat tv. Honestly I saw most of it, and all the time I sat in complete and complete disbelief. Is there any genre that is more meaningless than soft-core porn? If there is me, I don't want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horror of porn (miserable production values, abominable plays, crappy scripts) with the mystery of sex scenes in regular movies. So the end result is arousing or entertaining. This movie also has the rather strange approach to a science-fiction setting, and it seems terrible. All the meat is performed in a form of virtual reality, where the crew from the future learn about physical love. And yes, it's about as confused and silly as it sounds. <br /> <br /> But there must be some positive points, right? Now there's a ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. It's about the only thing that was less than terrible in this movie. I don't know what it is about her, but she has a great sex appeal. The rest of the cast looks like the standard porn cast though. Rather, uninteresting women with poorly executed false breasts, and men who have spent too much time in gymnastics, shine grotesquely. Probably a gym in Germany and judging by haircuts and clothes. <br /> <br /> To sum it up. If you enjoy Krista Allen's presence on the screen, you can see this for the short moments when she shows some of her seductive potential (mostly she tries to formulate crazy lines in dialogue). If you don't enjoy Krista Allen then you might as well stay away completely. <br /> <br /> I rate this 10/10 for Krista Allen's sex appeal, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value as this is a unique crappy porn / science fiction hybrid that doesn't really like anything , I have ever seen.
