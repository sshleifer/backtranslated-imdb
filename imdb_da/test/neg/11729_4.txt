Dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything actually. The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not save this pointless and unpleasant movie. The director's implicit invitation to viewers is not only to suspend disbelief but to suspend the judgment. Probably it is supposed to be steaming and threatening, but even if the film has its erotic moments, they are few and far between. This kind of thing has been done better by many others. Don't go out of your way to see it.
