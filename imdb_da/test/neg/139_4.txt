When I was young, I would get up early every Saturday morning not to see cartoons, but to turn on the local channel for what was called the 'Kung Fu Theater'. It wasn't like these movies were works of art. It was not as if these films all came from China, Japan, Korea or any particular country. if the story had to do with battle? be it swordplay or fisticuffs ?? And if the matches didn't look like much of anything going on in any American gym class, then it was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really good. They were just big action flicks with incredibly dramatic music, where the hero reaps his revenge on a host of bad guys, and so the credits would roll. <br /> <br /> "Swords in the Moon" very much resemble those films in my youth, probably a bit of a thematic recall given a welcome twist by mudding the characters up enough so that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the evil ones from the good . <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as "the human butcher." He kills quickly and relentlessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty, an emperor's head bodyguard, who saves his life and the lives of his men in exchange for his service. But a ruthless rebellion and his lovely sidekick look out into the country and begin to murder imperial ministers, and Yun is trying to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes a personal discovery as he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend of his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. Unfortunately, "Sword" doesn't have much to distinguish from other action movies. Some amazing cinematographs are almost completely wasted on scary editing with parts of the movie put together so loosely it is hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the movie was what someone intended. While the atmosphere and history tend to weaken towards a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the endless parade of flashbacks, as each of the main characters gets a healthy arc of history. What should have been a quick and easy action movie is balanced by far too much personal luggage and the movie suffers as a result. I've read that this movie marks Korea's first real foray in the world of artificial action pieces along like "crouching tiger, hidden dragon." Next time I would strongly recommend that the producers stay a little more 'martial arts' and a little less 'art'.
