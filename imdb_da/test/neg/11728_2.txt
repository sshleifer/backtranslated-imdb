Totally forgettable movie but an incredible soundtrack: I would give it (soundtrack) a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is fantastic! I watched the movie years ago and had to check out IMDb to remember what it was all about. I obsessed to get the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, who is "second" lead guitarist to Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band. This guy can play! The pianos are handled by Nils (he can't sing very well - for raspy), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
