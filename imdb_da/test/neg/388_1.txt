Closet Land is an uncomfortable job with amazing actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the film besides the endless abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police officer. The setting is minimalist. This can be considered soft core S&M porn because drama is devoid of all reference points such as time, place and political context. As it happens, carving is in a futuristic environment, the abuse is purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning of the evil of the totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for this young woman's torture, we get away disturbed but have not learned anything. What's the point? That torture exists in the world? Abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land echoes such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both of these works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and in-depth meaning. This work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. A particular thumbs down.
