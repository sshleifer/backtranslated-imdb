There is some irony in a parody of the Gothic genre that turns into a clip of clich√©s of filmmakers who either had no idea what the purpose of history was or just did not care. All the characteristics of your average family movie are present - rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teen who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who can't see the portrayal, and of course a romantic subplot. The film has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to poker fun on the melodramatic gothic short stories that were all that anger at that time. If Wilde saw this version, he would probably laugh - and then of course write a parody. One can only hope that the children who saw this gentle, mass-produced cardboard eventually discovered the white and sparkling original version.
