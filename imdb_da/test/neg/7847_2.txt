A clutchy young man returns the vest after schooling in the hotel industry via Boston; He quickly teaches his friends in Spanish colonized Old California expects him to fill his late father's shoe instead of a romantic thief known to kiss his female victims after robbing them. Colorful but silly M-G-M production has a large amount of talent before and behind the camera, but it never takes off. This could have been fun, second strand material to Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looks lost and embarrassing. The combination of raucous comedy and musical spaces is hampered by the bad staging (Sinatra is photographed singing at some point in a mirror, but you're not concentrating on his performance as much as noticing how odd the star seems reflected in this way!). Kathryn Grayson is the governor's daughter who falls for Frank, and her high soprano vibration turns her song scenes into self-pity. Apart from Robert Surtees' filmography and the decent artistic direction, this "Bandit" remains kiss-free. * from ****
