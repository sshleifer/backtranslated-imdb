I recently found this movie on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the shiny variety he uses to record things from telly). The movie looks like it was last shown in the eighties and I can't remember having seen it since. It is not (according to my knowledge) published on DVD or VHS, even though I have to search for a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one at puberty and the other much younger, and a young boy who goes to live with their mother's brother and his young, dumb Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak that forces her young wife to wear a silver collar while she sees a puppet show performed by him and his brothers in his toy holder. The oldest girl and one of the Irish (the younger) develop a love for each other while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt out in the shop while her brother helps her uncle to do things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements to the movie. There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as a kind of stupid (literally) possession (illustrated by the collar), while the Irish indulge in dancing, drinking and some forbidden love. Interestingly, I have seen far more explicit themes played out in other films made in Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> Do you wonder if the British film industry and the BBC have some sort of hidden agenda on their way. <br /> <br /> Although not a children's film, there are still many playful moments, and one Irish does some beautiful paintings.
