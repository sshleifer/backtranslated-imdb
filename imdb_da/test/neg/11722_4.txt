I saw this movie for a reason: the tagline is "Upset your head and you're dead!" Cracking. It is not surprising that this stupid horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box, but it twists a few laughs from its oddball premise and the cast of characters: an eagle-eyed human radar, a great strong and a great - Broken sexual magnet is all soul-controlled by a large head in a chair that is not happy that his family is being harassed by a murderous scumbag. It seems to be a promising mix of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are a white wonder and the plot is quite common if you erm, ignoring the giant head.
