This is a bad movie. It definitely belongs to how not to make a movie in the category of film. History, direction, acting and style are all flat like a pancake. The story consists of five ?? yes five ?? football matches spread beyond the duration of the film, each more elaborate than the last, as a dysfunctional amateur football team goes from strength to strength. That's what it's plotted. It's hard to know who this movie is aimed at. It's too banal for football fans, and there's nothing in it for teenagers or adults. Nor is there anything in it for women who are not even female. It's sadness slips you down as the team plays games after the game after the game after the game after the game. The story, as it is, seems to be dialogue and manicures apparently lifted from a vanguard Ireland, with all the actors spitting cod theatrical Dublin accents. It should not be seen to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Can anyone give me back my 90 minutes. The highlight of the credits at the end, low point for many to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
