Stay Alive is a boring horror movie about a video game that kills people in the same way they die inside the game. The friends who play this game soon figure out, and then they realize they must defeat the bloodthirsty from the video game or accept their destiny. We've had video tapes in The Ring, a deadly site in FearDotCom. Now it's on video games. Stay alive doing some good things; The drawing development is quite a bit deeper than it would normally be in a horror movie. We really look into some of the character's feelings and past and teach them all quite well so that the audience can get some feelings for them. The film is also very exciting. Tense, unpleasant moments are often played through the movie, accompanied by disturbing, eerie music. There are lots of cracks and jolts for the viewer. This may be ideal once or twice, but these fake scares, which Hollywood apparently enjoys in horror movies today, have thin in Stay Alive. The camera tends to give sharp angles or quick flashes to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch and try to scare them with this sudden on-screen outbreak. Why? Gore is of course very weak because of the film's certificate. The writing of Stay Alive is very cheesy and quite ridiculous, and the characters tend to play it melodramatically and confusingly. Also, clich√©s come in from all directions, for example, people wandering around on their own in search of a strange sound, or if they have seen a figure in the dark, they will go and examine it. However, the computer graphics used for video game segments are quite impressive and look colorful and sharp, and work well with the rest of the movie. But in general, it's just not enough to stick to this movie. Stretching in just over a hundred minutes, it won't be a fight to stay alive, but rather stay awake.
