I hadn't heard of Soap Girl, but I saw a poster with a five star review from Film Threat outside the theater, so I figured out how bad it could be? Well, I soon found out. My God this movie was horrible. The most wooden play I've ever seen outside of a porn flick. Completely worrying dialogue. I just can't understand how this was made and why someone agreed to be part of it. And I find it quite inconceivable that this was actually shown in a theater and money was charged to see it. How did this happen? And most importantly, what was the yellow of the movie threats thinking?!?!?!?!
