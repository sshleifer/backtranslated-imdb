Deep Sea 3D is a fantastic insight into an underwater world, few have had the opportunity to see first hand. <br /> <br /> From the opening sequence when a wave rushes toward the audience instantly sucks us into the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A gel-like field appears to fill the entire theater, a shark power against us, predators hit behind rocks and devour their prey. It is beautifully caught under the sea feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, our ears don't get the same treatment. The movie is told by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sounds so ridiculous, it positively spoils the enjoyment of the pictures. Depp sounds a little bored, while Winslet sounds like she is reading a bedtime story to the village idiot. I was shocked that an actress of her status could have mistakenly put her performance. The script is rather stupid and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is filled with strange, unrealistic sound effects that I suppose to be fun, but in fact, the attention of the material that should have allowed itself to be detracted. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has given an excellent score that has a lot of influence on the ups and downs of life when it is allowed to play without the silly bubble sounds or crayfish fever as a pepper film. <br /> <br /> The movie is a technical wonder, but with the childish script, annoying narrative and misplaced sound effects, it cannot be taken seriously.
