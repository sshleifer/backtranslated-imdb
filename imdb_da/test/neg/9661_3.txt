wow, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie was embarrassed to the original sandlot. Everything about this movie was horrible. terrible. Every single part except the part of the 'Mexican' sandlot manager was awful. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, although only partial parts were horrible. This was the worst role ever. Even the child actor, who played him as a child, was someone you would like to beat, even in the end, lol. This movie reminded me of the kid's movies that go the extra mile, making some goofy far beyond the fun stage. The mood was for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> If your over 12 and want something worth seeing, skip this movie and see a sitcom instead.
