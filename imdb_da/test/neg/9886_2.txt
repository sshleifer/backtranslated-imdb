The movie blood and chocolate is nothing like the book. The reason has completely changed and the one who chose the cast needed to read the book. First, the girl is not an introverted Aden's. Vivian was the one who chased Aden. Her mother should have survived and be the one after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who made all the murders with Ralf an ex of Vivian's. Gabriel is not old. He looks old. And Aden didn't get Vivian in the end, Gabriel did. The title came from Vivian comparing kisses from Aden (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (leaking like blood). She chose blood because it promised more and he understood her more. It reminds me, Gabriel is not against people as in the movie. He just avoids intimacy with them because they hurt him in the past. Really the book is sooooooo much better than the movie. But if you want to see watch, a dating montage, and a lot of jumps. Then it's the movie to see.
