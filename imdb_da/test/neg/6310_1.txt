I haven't seen this movie this year, but the awful "taste" of Quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid has "Jerry Lee Lewis" for a tee, but the fact is that he only seems to have the most extreme stage in mind Jerry. No one works that way all the time, and the show comes as hopelessly clownish, reducing Lewis to a buffoonish caricature. The nuances of a person's life are lost in the very overactive ruins. <br /> <br /> The author of the book, based on (Nick Tosches), is a good writer who has written several fine musical bios (I especially liked "Dino" at Dean Martin); in the books, Tosches gives us a full human, both separated from and involved in "biz." Quaid's action seems to mean that Jerry has never acted like a human. If people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them. As comics it goes mildly entertaining, but otherwise it is one of the most egregious, film-destroying performances I have had "honor" of viewing. Terrible...
