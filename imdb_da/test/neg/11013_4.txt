If you really really enjoy movies with ants that build dirt mirrors, eat non-ants, and conquer the world with a voice-over story, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working from a bio-dome communicate with very intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this movie) to try to counter their conquest and extinction plans. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl they rescue from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye and horrid plays), but to no avail. I suppose they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be too fast. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie "Phase IV" is something of a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts just after the opening point, while you do not reach "Phase IV" until the final credits roll. Apparently the director knew that the movie would be boring to get through and then placed Phase 1 - 3 throughout the film as a kind of progress report: "Stay there buddy! Only 1 more phase to last credit!" As an MST3K episode, this was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from season 0 on KTMA when they first started, so riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad, not even J & TB can ease it up. There are one or two Gamera references as they just finished riffling 5 Gamera movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has a trick / surprise ending, but I was so happy to reach the end, the impact was lost on me.
