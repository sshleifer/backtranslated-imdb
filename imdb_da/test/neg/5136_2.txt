This movie has good intentions, at least in the message "Don't be afraid, no matter how hard it may be. Fear will kill you in the end." It's a good message, but the container is so flawless that the message gets broken by bad action, complete lack of credibility in the emotions, dialogue delivered as if read aloud, stereotypes rather than breathing, living people. It abuses effects like slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the play and thus lack of emotional power ... The suicide part of it reminds me of a low budget movie from the early 90s when lesbians seemed to have (at least celluloid) a complete incapacity for living good, happy lives and a tendency to be caught in over-the-top dramas that often involved separation, death or imprisonment. <br /> <br /> Had it focused on the benefits of living life according to how we feel (and not in terms of how others think we should live it), it would be less dramatic and more inspirational. But it does not, it focuses on pain, loss and leaves the message with a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I can't see how this movie can inspire anyone to get out or overcome fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a great movie talking about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel, go back to the magnificent "Desert Hearts" (even better: read the story!)
