By far the most racist and ghetto cartoon for children 7+. Children who look at this cartoon will probably try to dress, talk and act as the characters portrayed. I am disappointed with Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. to accept flying this terrible program. Wayan's brothers can be good at movies intended for the young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make more episodes for this cartoon. Normally, young celebs begin to work in movies and make voice-overs for comics, and as they grow older, they move to young adult programs. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first began to look at All-That, later he starred in MIB II, then Drumline, and now his television show, Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out, where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how celeb children watched television long ago, can become those involved in non-child-friendly programs. It is very sad that this is happening, but all celebs are changing and growing. It's just the opposite of Wayans Brother's new cartoon. It is bad enough that we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos as the young generation can see this program, it will only convert the children with opportunities for those who have no chance of a good life. Just my feelings on this cartoon and my belief in what will happen to our children if they should see it.
