Why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews? <br /> <br /> This is amateurish, involuntary and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing is the corny title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are low and "comedic" (if you want to call them that) ideas are weak, they act as remnants of SNL remnants that even they wouldn't dare put on the screen. <br /> <br /> I begin to misunderstand IMDb ratings. <br /> <br /> It's bright years away from the Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same galaxy. It is not even possible to write 10 lines about it. <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something you can't see much in today's TV and movies.
