I can only laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movie, I really do. I mean, the Chopping Mall is a classic. But what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies that tried to be good. But it was hardly fun ... I mean, I think it was because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks ... awful. And the film has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. It is rated PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater" you know won't be a blockbuster movie you know it probably doesn't have a smart script. A movie this one can trust gore ... but no. It doesn't really matter, it's just ... shit. Check it out if you want to laugh. But don't expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski goes back to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV because this and Komodo Vs. Cobra doesn't cut it.
