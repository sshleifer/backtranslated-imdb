A British teen film centering around a girl (Justine) accidentally creates her dream man (Jake) using a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well not just one?) She gets caught in his body with a geek as the only one who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. It sounds much worse than it is, I found it more visible for the reason why Laura Fraser was the lead in it more than the movie content. She actually looks amazing, especially when she dresses in a red lycra dress to impress Jake, WOW !!, if I only had a virtual reality machine ??????
