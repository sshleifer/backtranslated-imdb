This story is about a safari in Africa that meets a guy named Trent - convincing them to seek a tribe of white babes. Of course, they turn out to be Amazon warriors and catch the men. The rest is pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you would expect in a basement basement movie about Africa - the significant use of often irrelevant stock footage, movies of non-native animals (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a white actress in dark makeup who plays a native, bad play (especially from Trent - a beautiful man with the balsa tree's personality), comic relief (similar to Chico Marx), a guy dressed in a gorilla costume and bikini - dressed white women with perms, supposedly violent jungle warriors - as a tribe of angry female Tarzans. By the look of it, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $ 49.95 - including the development of the cost and payment for the rental of the gorilla clothing! But what I didn't expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is poor, but not so poor, as it is a watch production in every possible sense, and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated so high! Now I DO NOT say that the movie is not worth watching - it is campy and stupid enough to make it easier to see - especially with friends. Just don't expect anything that looks like a professionally made or competent movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is a smattering of the dialogue of this jungle classic: "Oolama as a strong white man. Oolama will have strong white man ..." <br /> <br /> "oonga bunga" <br /> <br /> "me-te-tonga .... no .... keeel") basket "
