Martin Lawrence is not a fun man I run around. He has just too much in his mind, and he is too sour, raising his pennies early in the game. He tries to make fun of critics who boil down to "f *** them". Then he continues with pretty primitive sexual jokes on smokers with neck cancer, and it just goes downhill from there. 3.10
