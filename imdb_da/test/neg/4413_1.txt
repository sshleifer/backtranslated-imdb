I watched this movie once at a kiddie matinee at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959 when it was released and I was 11. It was one of three features that was shown that day. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it since, but have wanted it because I'm a movie and appreciate it terribly along with the big, good and average movies. What I remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members of children aged 8 to 15 shouted with laughter on the wooden pattern. A triple bill at a theater with 3 adventure films is something that an 11 year old does not forget, but I can't remember the names of the other 2 movies. (One star George Montgomery and David Farrar.) <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other 2 movies in this triple bill were much better. They were "Watusi", 1959, with George Montgomery and David Farrar starring and "The Angry Red Planet" in 1959 with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden staring. Ms. Hayden has also written a few books on health and fitness.
