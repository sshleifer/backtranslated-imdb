The most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time Garbo spoke in a movie. Apart from the 'milestone' (if you want to call it that), it's a movie that doesn't go beyond creaking melodrama, with Garbo trying his best not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The reason involving Greta Garbo returns to his father after 15 years abroad. Her father, a captain of a barge, is happy to see her even though she seems a little cagey. She soon falls in love with a grizzled sailor, who also notes that something, a barrier if you like, will hold her back. <br /> <br /> In any case, the two do not love each other and will soon blow over Garbo as she diffuses the situation by revealing her great secret, which is not surprising to us if you have read the video box (damn you MGM !!) Garbo is nothing but weapons in this movie, she trades and trades slams her arms and gets lattice quickly. The two male leaders are fine. Probably the best performance comes from the classic quiet actress Marie Dressler, who plays the drunk captain's lonely drunker girlfriend. What a performance! It's wrong, the tagline couldn't have read, "Dressler Talks!"
