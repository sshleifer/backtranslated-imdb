I was thrilled to see this show when I started watching A&E promoted. I've been fascinated with ghosts and paranormal since I was a kid and love to catch "Ghost Hunters" when on (sci-fi channel). I have tried to see three episodes of "Paranormal State" and only spend my time commenting on it because it is so bad and persistent that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a freak free freak. "Paranormal State" is beyond cheesy. Cheesy "Director's Log" voice-overs who will leave you wanting Captain Kirk. Cheesy teasers go into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context. Everything paranormal on this show is believed to be "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then comes the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... as in "Poltergeist", you almost expect the team to leave and say "This house is clear." I greatly appreciate the "Ghost Hunters" approach, where they are in favor of disproving claims, so take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring to the customer (if they find anything) that haunted does not respond for evil. "Paranormal state" is not "so bad, it's good" ... it's just pretty bad. Not A&E used to stand for "Arts & Entertainment"? The art part has long gone and the entertainment factor is now also decreasing.
