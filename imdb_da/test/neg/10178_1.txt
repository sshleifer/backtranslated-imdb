First of all, I have nothing against Christianity. I think every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But I can't imagine how stupid a person should be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. They would rather use it to feed some starving families in third country countries. I will not speak of speech action or plot of this "movie" because I could not find any of them in this one. History is simple - two reporters, one (A) is an atheist, the other (B) has for some reason left religion. B regains his confidence in religion and teaches A a lesson - believing in Christ or going to hell. This message appears after about ten minutes and continues to repeat until the end of the movie. People, do not believe the rating of this "movie", read reviews first. I have not wasted an hour in my life :( PS: Why is it classified as sci-fi? Because of the few nice sounds and some light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil actions? It's a new :)
