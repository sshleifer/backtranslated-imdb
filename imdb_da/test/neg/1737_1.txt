Worst.film.ever Nothing else should be said. Aaron Carter is completely repulsive and the rest of the casting material must immediately extinguish their substances. It's really a horrible horrible movie from the beginning to the end. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing the films many (oh so many) errors, but I can't be disturbed / become too sour to make ordinary sentences. <br /> In short, I absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad, it was good", it was a kind of way ... <br /> <br /> It was unadultered dragon. <br /> <br /> Gavin
