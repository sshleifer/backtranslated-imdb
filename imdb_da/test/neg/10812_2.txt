Take your camcorder, turn off all the lights in your house and film people running around with an hour and a half, and you have the basic idea of ​​how this movie looks. It is very annoying to see this kind of movie. To be fair there is daylight at the beginning and at the end of the movie. I like scary movies and creativity, but this just didn't matter to me. So sorry. I really tried to like it. There didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we have to find our way out of here. Didn't learn too much about any of the characters, so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open water" has that title for now.
