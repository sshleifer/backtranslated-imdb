Some movies you want to see because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow. Some you want to see because you will be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; These will not directly feed you, but they will help you place yourself in a larger world than you would otherwise have. And at least the hard parts of life are what you choose not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are movies that don't do any of these things, you want to keep an eye on the commitment or because you need a historical connection. These are rather worthless experiences of building a life. The problem, of course, is that you often don't know which of the three movies to go into. You can get some indications from people you trust, but because a life in movies is so personal, you really don't know until you go blind. For me it was pretty worthless. Yes, yes, I know, because many Bunuel are the epitome of the sublime and rich. And you should know (if you don't) that among my greatest movie experiences, some very strange movies are very strange. It is not that this is not cinematic or symbolic deep, or apolitical / politically friendly in my opinion. Its how it comes that is off base. Its the deviation from the real deviation that annoys me. Part of the problem is that this is a successful alternative art, meaning it is successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can simply be explained, and the explanation is not only broadly acceptable but simply coded in shorthand. Surely all this is true. When the word "surreal" is used, it is generally used incorrectly to denote a movie image or a world that differs from reality or seems strange. But when used correctly, which means consensus theory, it's always about Bunuel, and especially this film and the one he really did with Dali. So because they invented surrealistic cinema, one defines and manages the concept. It pamperes myself and I have my own alternative definition that does not come from their philosophy. That's because philosophy is completely in conflict. It is not at all a philosophy, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. The packed anarchy carefully chooses the things they use and the things they oppose without clearly distinguishing them. So okay: against linearity, against narration, against story, against religion (an easy one) against conscious love. But for an illinary linear story, to establish his own story (celebrated by countless film school professors; what else can they do); for a kind of transcendent "unintentional" love. <br /> <br /> It's his own enemy. If there was a Bunuel alive today when he sold his image, the first thing he wanted to do was attack the church or the surreal. My regular reader knows that in almost every case I play film Spanish and avoid the French. But in the surrealistic case I would like to think back: Get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
