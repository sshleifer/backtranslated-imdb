Yes, the movie was so boring and incomplete. After a certain time, I wanted the hook to eat these people so we could get the film over. <br /> <br /> The reason is that three Aussies take a fishing trip up a river in a small boat where a fishing guide steers on a gun. He says he's just doing it for insurance purposes, all crocs have been chased out of this river. He is eaten immediately by a Croc. The trio then gets chased up a tree, gets picked up by the reptile in their attempt to escape. They use most of the movie to argue over the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> Predictably, one survivor finds the travel guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. Aww, they killed the film's only sympathetic character! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
