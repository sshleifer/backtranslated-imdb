Eugene O'Neill's 4 and a half hour 1927 game brought on screen in less than two hours. The toy's combination of symbolic dialogue and Gothic melodrama has not lived very well, and the casting has some problems with it, especially Norma Shearer's Nina and Ralph Morgan's Marsden. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes out better, but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the other philosophical paintings that better fit Gable's reach. When the plot sits down to the quadrangle of love and the audience adapts to the voiceover, the movie becomes more enjoyable. The technique used here for the little ones is another problem. On the scene, the action was froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. Here they are finished as voiceovers. You think it would work better, but since the action no longer freezes, the actors are forced to pause and talk on the camera to match the feelings of their thoughts. Plus it's hard for any movie bird to watch this movie and not think of Groucho Marx's hilarious parody version in "Animal Crackers." Added to these disadvantages are some cuts made for censorship reasons (Nina's promiscuity is soft-knuckle and there is no mention of getting the abortion more central to the game) and a miserable score (unredited) that sounds like background music to a turn-of-the-century weepie. O'Neill called this movie "a horrible hash for attempting condensation and idiotic censorship" and although "Strange Interlude" is not as close as his later "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night", it certainly deserved better than this.
