This movie was not so good at all. Here's the first clue, and it's not going to be a strong movie, Harrison Ford's name doesn't just appear first, but it's also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, what was it? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The action was, at best, except for the Amish boy, he did a decent job of being so young. Then you have the story, which was weak and slightly over the place, and it won the custom! The music was horrible, I know I already said something, but it was really bad. The premises were really good and it had to be restored. Well that's all I really have. <br /> <br /> Your average movie guy, <br /> <br /> -Trever
