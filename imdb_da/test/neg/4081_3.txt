Evan Almighty continues the regular Bruce Almighty franchise, this time with beginner freshman congressman from Buffalo, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) turned in the center. A completely innocent (and not even truly self-indulgent) man, God (Morgan Freeman) decides to enforce a sort of search for Baxter to illustrate the importance of ... mutual friendliness so that Baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay further). Think of Evan the Almighty as a healthy derivative of 'Distinguished Gentlemen'. Baxter is not a cone, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman) wants his undisputed support for a bill that is essentially harmful to the environment. And well-meaning Baxter, who knows the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support him. <br /> <br /> In addition, the new job comes with more responsibility, and Baxter is somewhat confused, not spending enough time with his family. <br /> <br /> So God decides to give Evan Baxter guidance by forcing him to become the modern Noah. His orders: build a sheet. Unless it can be mildly humorous to see Baxter's transformation into "weirdo with beard-o", it does not seem to be much point on this whole thing that becomes amply clearer when the movie's climax fizzles. (SPOILERS: If none of the people are killed by the "flood", then what was supposed to call the animals ... or at least those who apparently weren't from suburban Virginia? Or more importantly, if all Baxter had to Realizing that Long's projects fall into their quality, why should he build a sheet? So even though a comedy like this doesn't have to be a hysterical laughing rebellion, one was certainly made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with too many homilies (and not all of Morgan Freeman) and action that seemed to be intended for a movie with several epic events.
