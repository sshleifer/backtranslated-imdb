Anyone can make a movie these days. Budget, production value or experienced herds do not have to stop the self-described "director" from "realizing their dream" these days. Respect for the craft of filmmaking or even just respect for any movie aesthetics is no longer a prerequisite for actually performing a movie. Director Bill Cowell must have believed he beat gold when Lion's Gate decided to market his original movie as a sequel to a movie he had nothing to do with. <br /> <br /> I personally find the Lion Gate far, far more erroneous than Cowell with regard to Dark Harvest 2, which is made available to the public. Lion's Gate's misleading marketing of this movie should be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office and Lion's Gate officers should be sung in sulfuric acid and petroleum for their complete disrespect for film, filmmaking and good sense. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.
