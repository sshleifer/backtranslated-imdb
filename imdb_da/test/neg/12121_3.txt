Unfortunately, a boring flick and of course the only way to see the slaughtered bootleg Public Domain version, which is so blurry and dark, is that you sometimes find it difficult to figure out where the screen is. The leading players are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to appear as rude, charming and sexy. He completely forgets what the movie is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some women who played him for a goose to begin with. The lady herself only goes through the girl, being worthy if she is not busy, seems to be sweet. It's a pretty poorly written thing, never interesting or witty. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets. It only scratches the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this completely incalculable flick.
