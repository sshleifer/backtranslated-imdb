It's strange what fate does for some people. As I looked at the discount box at a DVD dealer, I encountered a copy of Deadly Instincts. Being a collector of any movie that is either sci-fi, horror or with alien monsters, I decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars a good buy, believe me). After seeing it, I was of the opinion that it was nothing special. But after doing some research on the internet I discovered that the movie is actually called Breeders & was a remake of Tim Kincaid horror flick that threatened video stores in the mid-1980s. As I have already seen. My appreciation for "Deadly Instincts" grew after this discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college. The only teacher there, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen? That's right, the guy who turns into a cyborg in the cult CYBORG COP four years earlier) notes that some students are starting to disappear while encountering a black -haired woman with a pea face and wearing a kinky leather outfit. His study shows that a strange creature had taken a trip on the meteorite and had come to Earth to breed with the local women. Along with a local detective who believes he is responsible for the disappearances, Ashley tries to stop the monster. <br /> <br /> The original BREEDERS, directed by Tim Kincaid (who wanted to leave the genre to make gay porn) was a sci-fi / horror movie that was actually a thinly blurred soft-core porn movie designed to take skin flicks for genre fans. It is, in my opinion, one of the worst films made in the 1980s. Why anyone would like to reinvent it is a complete mystery. This remake is actually a better bet than the low budget source. The film, which embraces the basic concept of a foreign monster trying to interfere with human women, eliminates all pornographic elements. In fact, the film is actually very tame. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even under the shower stage), severe and violence kept to a minimum level and there are no gore (which can cheat gorehounds). This makes remake a movie safe for the whole family, that is, if the kids are not afraid of foreign monsters (which brings me to the movie's M 15 + rating, which seems a bit much). <br /> <br /> The relationship to the subject is aside, the film has some errors. The script, with some good characterizations, has a number of holes so large that you can break down a meteor through. <br /> <br /> What? You're angry with me for that? Come on, this review needed a bad saying so it will stay interesting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie's setting is a problem the script failed to fix ?? The movie is set in Boston, but the buildings do not seem to belong in Boston. Something about the architecture is not right. Another thing is the college itself, with a rather large building that holds about twenty students (all women, of course) and only has one class ?? art. The only teacher who has a relationship with a student (and also the guard!) Who somehow escapes the principal's attention. Not to mention the police, who is so one-dimensional (& stupid) that the real Boston PD would have a good case if they ever decided to sue. Oh, and the meteor ?? well the chance that a meteor sent from Saturn (check the opening credits) when Earth without recovery is astronomical. It does not include the chances of all passengers in the meteor surviving the landing. <br /> <br /> As far as the play goes, Todd Jensen gives a reliable performance as the heroic teacher, while the late Kadamba Simmons (who was murdered by his girlfriend shortly before the movie came out) cuts a striking figure in this leather outfit as well as prove she can shop. The visual effects are run-of-the-mill, with credits due to the filmmakers to bring us a cool monster.
