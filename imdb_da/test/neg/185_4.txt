Don't make me wrong. I really love the "arena martial arts genre" and I am increasingly surprised at how many movies like this one are out there. This is one of them, and it's not even close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues in it I thought it would be good. However, he cannot save this movie, and to be honest, he was not very good either. Just do not pay attention to what other people say; The fighting sequences in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I'm talking about since I've seen so many movies like this. There are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. I suppose they only added these to make the movie a bit longer, in addition to manifesting the bad guy who, uuuuuuh ....... bad (which we didn't already know).
