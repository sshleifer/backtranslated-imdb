My friends and I have seen this so many times I have lost count. This is worth seeing for them in the right state of mind, which means that this is not so much a good scary movie as a lampoon movie for its funny quotes and bad effects. This movie is best seen with other similar individuals, so you have someone to laugh with. <br /> <br /> You will laugh when Greg jumps and blends in the lab and pits his pet rabbit while his bones change from right to left on the back. "Greg, stop itching!" Brandon. You will laugh like J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to lead Greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the shot. And you will probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman doesn't have any of the features he used to construct her.
