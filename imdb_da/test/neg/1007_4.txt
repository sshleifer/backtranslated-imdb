I was disappointed with the third movie in the "Death Wish" series and would not recommend it unless you really are in Bronson. He is his usual self in this, perhaps a little lighter than the others; the rest of the casting is good if you watch a movie in the week on TV - the whole movie has the production value of a bad episode of A-Team and I like the escapism with a show as A-Team, but not on the big screen, although it is an action movie that does not claim to be so advanced. The movie takes a while to get started, and when it finally does, it gets out of control at the point of ridicule. The reason is something out of an episode of "Highway to Heaven", and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizens cast and gun games are so uncontrolled that you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the evil guys. Skip this and continue to the 4th installment, which I highly recommend.
