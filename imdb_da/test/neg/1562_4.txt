Reason: Four people are trapped in a lift. One is a businessman, the annoying species who is aggressive and complains of everything and everyone and is a talkative talk of distilled stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more comfortable in her character. A teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman sour, and an older guy who just stole 100,000DM constitutes the rest of the throw ... The movie is all about how they handle their problem that time goes on and without success to reach the world when the lights go out and as the cables begin to snatch one another in succession .... <br /> And yet it's not too exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator?). You don't like the characters much, you just hate one of them. And all the twists in the plot do not contribute to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses for completing another few minutes of dialogue, as the writers still run out of inspiration and ink on a full-length movie in a lift. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope "Phone Booth" will be a better bet ...
