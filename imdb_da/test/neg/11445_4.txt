A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the murder to the local police and becomes a hit target for the mob operators. A professional murderer, Dennis Hopper, employed by mafia, stalks her to prepare for the heat, but eventually he falls for her. So, as a parody of the Stockholm syndrome that defines a case when a kidnapped hostage begins to suffer and collaborates with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster also falls for her abductor, loves and both prepares for an escape. <br /> <br /> Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to adapt to the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing and fails to keep up with the artistic level of a great performer that Dennis Hopper is. There is no real excitement and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is to some extent rescued by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not best for her, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is Vincent Price's short appearance, and in a small act of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in "Wall Street". <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend the 116 minutes watching the movie, it's not a complete loss; This movie offers easy entertainment but we would expect much more from the director of "Easy Rider" and the actor who gave us Sarah Tobia's character in "The Accused".
