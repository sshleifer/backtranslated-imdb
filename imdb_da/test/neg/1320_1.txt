Just as bad as they get This film commits the fatal error, whereby the viewer does not like what happens to characters. The two women in this flick are so stupid that you start to mess with the evil ones, so this thing would end. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel. <br /> <br /> Set in highbrow language, this movie lacks verisimilitude. People, not even people from Ohio, simply don't act like this. Well, maybe the authors do. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
