What a shame. What a horrible shame. The table was set, the candle was lit, the guests had arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... not really. Just pretentious drivel. It could have been good, OK maybe not great, but it could have been very good. All the items were there, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: NO LIGHT! How it happened is a mystery with everything at the director's disposal ... the story was quite brave, though it certainly required a great deal of work on possibly more posters to correct the story and tighten up characters a lot (all that was consistent and constant and unnecessarily tight was cinematography, but I come to that). But the direction was miserable, the play was just that: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham, then the cinematography ... it was something to see! But only if you are in film school "Cinematography 101, how to never use a professional film camera in any case". It was clear that the student had fallen asleep through part of the lecture's introduction and only heard "... use a professional movie camera ..." and then happily return to la la as the phrase is finished. can I say; amateurish and pretentious at last! I can only see this movie intended to appeal as a Chick Flick because it had to be sad but then fall and then stop being "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so even those 'Chicks' would not be fooled by this schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> PS. I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She is much better at her craft than what this movie allowed her to be, even though she was completely miscast. In fact, I feel sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and (you guessed it) the cinematographer! I say '1 to the wall for them when the revolution comes!' Okay, not really, it was just a movie "but maybe a good" tar and feather and run out of town "might be more satisfying or at least much more entertaining !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN: - (
