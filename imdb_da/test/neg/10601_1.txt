** Possible Spoilers ** Three youngsters on the wrong side of the law get the chance to turn their lives and become useful members of the community by becoming the undercover police in 'The Mod Squad', a resurrection of the hit TV series of ' The 60s, directed by Scott Silver. Because of their less than stellar backgrounds, and because of who they are and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go elsewhere the police can't so they are tapped by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate a filthy nightmare suspected of being the front of a prostitution ring. In the beginning, Julie gets a job there as a waitress, while Pete and Linc just "hang out" to find out what they need. Julie is quickly recognized by an old boyfriend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who turns out to be involved in drugs tied to the shady conditions that go down the bar. Before it is over, the 'team' is up to the throat, while it is also run by a lot of crazy cops who are also involved in drugs and thus tied to their investigation. From the beginning of the movie there is a feeling that you are coming late; as if it is assumed that you know what is going on in relation to the group's origin and work. All you come here is the short mug-shot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse of their past; There is nothing about how this whole thing actually came about. The thought was probably that by doing so this would lead to the story quicker, getting things moving together. Although this is true to some extent, some added background would have made the texture history a little more interesting; The way it was done here only depreciates the credibility of the whole case. The reason is marginal to begin with, and any time spent on character development would have been well worth while. What is delivered, and quite unthinkable, is a less than compelling story filled with one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors do not get any help from the manuscript, nor from Silver; The Danes, Ribisi and Epps come close to strangling Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time they assigned them, coupled with lack of support, they still fall far short of giving these people life. Farina, a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here, comes as something more than a "good policeman's caricature". There is a feeling that everything was given once in this movie; some details and shades would have driven the inventory significantly on this one. The support model includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a shame to see the actresses involved here being wasted like this; much more thought and planning should have been included in this movie. As it is, it comes across as inconceivable and poorly executed. Danes, ribisi and epps are like big leagues who got stuck to play for all the marbles on the local sandlot; Instead of getting a shot at the title, they all hung out to dry. As Terry says in 'On the Waterfront': "You were my brother, Charlie, you should have looked at me." Now it's obvious that there wasn't Charlie looking for them here, and after "The Mod Squad" they can all just hope for something better to come next time. I rate this 1/10.
