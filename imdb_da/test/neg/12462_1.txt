As a rule, I try to find as much in movies as I possibly can enjoy them. I made no exceptions to "Tart" and did my very best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how big, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie. It failed for a number of reasons. First, cinematography was pointless and ineffective. Second, the manuscript reached depths of 'poor' who took it well and really beyond the category 'so bad is it good'. Third, the actions that were left in mind were desirable - it was appalling, it really was. Anyone who saw Mischa Barton (seen here as the remarkably terrible Grace, a character so poorly invented and realized that Yes Yes Binks doesn't seem so bad) as Devon in John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs" will wonder what went wrong between then and now . Perhaps she had got a sign that was worthwhile and a modicum of direction, she could have given this movie a redemption function. Alas, that was not the case. Finally, the film seemed to have no meaning whatsoever, expressed nothing, achieved nothing. I really wonder why Christina Wayne was bothering. <br /> <br /> "Tart" made a slight attempt to be something and failed. The result - a movie, unfortunately so bad that it's just very, very bad. Don't bother - it's really not worth it.
