One of the worst movies ever made. If you can get through this movie without falling asleep, do it well, considering how much you can turn up the volume, you can't hear what 'actors' (?) Are saying and if you can see what's going on from the horrible movie (I mean hell if you can't find something that works better ... use a home camera ... At least you can tell what's going on!) <br /> <br / > It's beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slide through the cracks and escape on video ... and more ... how do people do this not how terrible it is ... good good ... (!) <br /> <br /> After what I just told you ... If you're waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash, there's nothing to tell. .. a group of campers on motorcycles are lost in the forest and a lot of people are terrorizing them ... or something to it ... what more is an action movie than a horror ... is this movie? of no interest ... I like this, which I literally feel to you. <br /> <br /> Absolutely Trash ... not even one of the cheap fun flicks to see renting. 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' and get a ball
