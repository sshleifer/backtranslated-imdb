I agree that this movie is about sex without seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. In fact, I do not think at all about how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. In any case, did you know that the first hotel / drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or so? The Korean film was actually brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time forcing the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman differences in experience and thinking. I mean most of Neal N Nikki's hotel / drunk segment was emulated take take. Can't Bollywood filmmakers try to make originals alone, please? Seriously, I've never enjoyed a Hindi flick that's a copycat. Those I enjoy have always spoken Indian feelings through Indian cultural means.
