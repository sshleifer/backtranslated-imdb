The most notable thing about "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. The caller's voices all have a fake, read-from-a-script call to them. An evening with an annoying loudmouth at a Dallas radio station is told with the sarcastic insight into hell. Stone is trying for an existential revelation and instead has unintentional comedy. When a caller makes a "deep" point about something, the Stone pushes the camera on one of his character's faces as they are hit by a traumatic realization that is never revealed to the public. Bogosian constantly overcomes in one of the most annoying beliefs ever smeared on celluloid. Underrated classic? Give me a break.
