Nothing Carson Daly has ever said or done on this show ever made me laugh or even smile a little. I don't understand how this show has survived for so many years. Even the "fun" band member is like one of the kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to look at himself. Daly and that guy are just arrogant frat boys. It seems that they are not even trying to be a little fun. <br /> <br /> HORRIBLE TERRIBLE FEATURED SHOW. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I just can't stress enough how terrible this show is. Don't look at it. But if you absolutely must, I recommend to dress your eyes out and clog your ears with cement beforehand.
