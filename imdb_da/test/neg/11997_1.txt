This movie really started excitedly when a poor young boy was imposed by a pack of wild dogs. After a tense hunt, he is rescued by his grandfather with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We are then introduced to a number of annoying house comrades, including a pie that is always half-dressed. During this stage, the movie increases the tension with strange "plinky plinky" background sounds that had me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I paused for a while, but when I looked back at the screen, how strange the kind of thing goes around grunting and killing. A word of advice if you're ever caught in your home by some nutter - get some cardboard boxes and a tray. Although we ran half of the movie because it was not interesting or memorable, we are now at the fantastic conclusion, the last surviving being thing fights a "Whip Duel" with Grandpa and his magic whip. I don't want to say what is happening here, but I can say that the whip is full of tensions, with air combat, split level battles and all sorts of drama. <br /> <br /> Now I have to push this movie through the door of a neighbor I don't like.
