I think it's very interesting this movie is called a thriller. It is anything but exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear piano sounds. Then you hear piano sounds. Then some people talk about facts that do not concern anyone. <br /> <br /> Again piano sounds. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was the reason why I was able to register with IMDb because I think this movie is one of those people to be warned about. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: That way, the most actionable part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: "The actors". Yes, the quotes are intentional as you can think because they do not act. They play piano and make small talk, but it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> I think before this movie I never left a movie theater and felt angry. Really, this movie made me angry. Angry for the time and money I spent on it.
