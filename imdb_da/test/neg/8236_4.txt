Revising old movies that you thought was average is not necessarily a good thing. They sometimes get worse. Fighted by the Fangoria camp (in Gorezone they felt it "the most horrific movie since Texas CHAINSAW"? Um, no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably developed a cult feeling as an "intense" horror image. In fact, it's just an average stalk and slash? Uh, bid movie that briefly sets itself apart from the package by bidding on a killer who clucks like a chicken. Yes, chuckles like a chicken. For the filmmaker's credit, at least they didn't make the killer sound like a duck in LA NEW YORK RIPPER. It would just be silly. <br /> <br /> Narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying slasherfilm is bound by reason, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers fled. Luther is actually paroleed after a long scene where people argue that he is reformed even though he complains like a chicken and has shavings (which he apparently has shaped in prison). It's the kind of movie that a couple sees a bashed in the door, and the girl rejects it by saying, "Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys. She forgets many things since my father died." The kind of movie where the hysterical mother runs into a policeman looking for Luther and tells him, "The killer is in my house!" So what does he do? He grabs her and literally pulls back to the house and says, "Show me only where he is and I will do the rest." Why not call again? <br /> <br /> It's too bad that the movie is filled with such horrible action and dialogue because the Luther character is actually quite interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a dead ringtone to Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, which gives Clucking Luther a real air of threat. In the hands of a real instructor, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGER and be a true cinematic oddity. But Albright is not the instructor and just places Luther's fascinating character in dull slasher stairs.
