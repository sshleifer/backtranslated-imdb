While you were spending time on a Saturday morning, "Looking for Lola" came on HBO. I decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The movie was incredibly incredible, and there was absolutely no screen chemistry between leading actors, as I found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (main actor) in scenes where he skips the bill at a fancy restaurant and where Lola (lead actress) allows him to use her boss's house to trick her parents into believing he is rich, it was almost as bad as him "daydreams" about people around him who make the macarena (it was EXCELLENT!) and the two actors ultimately fall in love. I continued to change the channel, but I tried to give it all chances to become a sweet love story with a few chuckles. It never did. In fact, it became so bad that I decided to end it so I can claim that I looked at one of the worst movies ever made in its entirety, rather than being criticized for not giving it a fair chance ". The last scene where Lola is trying for a dance part was the culmination of the movie. She comes late after marrying (even the scene where Mike tells the pastor to hurry up and then just pulls the papers away and claims it is done was in line with this film's credibility) and then "convinces" the judges on one or more otherwise give her a look. The two male judges are already dismissing how late she is. But after seeing her waif around the scene (ok, she dances fine but not overly impressive), all joining Lola and Mike's families, other dancers there and * coughing * themselves the judges. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad I had to write a review. Look at your own risk.
