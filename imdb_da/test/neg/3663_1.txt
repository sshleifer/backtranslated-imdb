The not the best movie in the world ???? It was an understatement. I didn't like this movie at all. Not because of the story, not because of the graphic violence and nudity. The necessity didn't really have to be in it, it didn't matter to the story unless perhaps the girls went through a hard time, and being naked, probably believed them more. But one of the things in the movie I hated. Was that it was sooo dark. You couldn't really figure out what was going on. I think if it wasn't that dark and you could see where they were, maybe it wasn't that bad. Everything you know is a basement somewhere. You see no house, no way, the killer in it, all you could see was half face for about. 5 seconds. I want to see some things in a movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of pretty much dark, and everything you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. Then you will hear the girl sneak. There wasn't anything really stuck to me that was good about the movie, maybe the excitement of the movie's first 10 minutes ... but not the excitement of how the movie should end, but the excitement of .. I will see something in this movie, but a pair of bare bodies and various flashing lights. But honestly people, this was a saw meets Blair Witch Project wannabe. Both top notch films and both with the correct lighting to find out what was going on. Forget this movie if you can see .. if your blind person .. you might want to rent it to hear the screams if you are in that kind of thing. But then again, if you're blind, you probably won't read this either .. so anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
