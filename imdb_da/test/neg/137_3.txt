This is one of the more badly made movies I've ever seen. You have to take something of Truffaut seriously; It's not just some B-movies teeming with hackers. Of course, Truffaut could not decide if he made a noir or a sentimental chick flick. nor Deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply incredible - not even badly acted; just didn't act at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person like Julie / Marion is simply beyond everyone's ability to suspend disbelief; The role absolutely does not require anyone who is so beautiful. Belmondo's play also suffers even though his character is not as incredible as Deneuves. Unfortunately, the clich√© ends (which I do not want to describe) is far too appropriate for this complete mistake.
