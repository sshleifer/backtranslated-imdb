My Take: Of course, Steven Seagal is too boring to be the leader in an action thriller, even a boring one. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to do. Following the lead role in admirable audience-pleasing films such as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low ground for the bad movie ground. Now he is in low-budget B-level handling vehicles, some of which are "made of TV" settings that went off to the big screen. Half-dead death is among these, let's say, dead action movies. A loud and miserable action movie, dormant and lazily written (and worse, badly acted). This is one of the bad movies that I don't have to watch until the end by knowing it's bad. I didn't have the courage to get all my braincells to die while I was wasting my time with this. That's what this kind of bad movie you realize, the other movies you hate are not bad. The plot (and the room) is completely lifted from a similar image, Michael Bay is THE ROCK, although similar is not the word to describe it. Both films are summer films and are not meant to be taken so seriously. But in comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not much in the writing department as much as light and sounds) has better characters, a more compelling plot, better action sequences and generally a more entertaining atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in ninetieth death, none of them is exciting. Everyone is sometimes boring and predictable. Although predictability seemed to be a charitable asset in summer action movies, predictability has never tasted more sour in those who aren't funny, and half of death is never really fun, many times it's just a pain in the head (hear the bad rap music Repeat again and again throughout this movie making me yearn for an aspirin every second I hear them). The play is terribly mediocre, the plot is derived, without convincing or appealing signs at all. Seagal's character, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to be excited about. Seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick (played by rap star Ja Rule) and a lot of amigo inmates, and there is no chemistry going on here. <br /> <br /> If you look in a number of other forgotten action vehicles (what were these movies again?) killed by Seagal's career for good, HALFEST DEATH is overkill. And the audience is warned: you are invited to feel the pain. Advice: Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
