See, I almost lost all hope in Nickelodeon after seeing their latest "hit", The Naked Brothers Band Show, and "ICarly" is no exception! If you haven't noticed, ICarly is now # 1 hit tween sitcom on TV right now! After hearing it, I decided to see a few episodes myself to see what the hype was about! I have a word to describe this show in general ... "EFFORTLESS !!!" I can't believe Dan Schneider would go to this and do something here It is honest !!! Let me give you the details ... <br /> <br /> The ICarly cast starts with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Carly, unfortunately throughout the episodes, doesn't really have a personality to say about! I suppose she should be the average girl in the show (because a lot of people have a father of honor for a father, an artist for a brother, and a popular teenweb show wallpaper and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment!) And to say most about Miranda, Her action is pathetic !!! She sounds like a 3 year old girl with Tourette's syndrome on a sugar high half of the time! <br /> <br /> Next, we have Sam Puckett (good GOD, where do they get these names!?) played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is "CO-HOST" by Carly's webshow! (Wait a moment, if Sam hosts the show with Carly, don't the show be called "ICarly and Sam?" I bet Sam feels like she's been ripped off!) Sam must be bullied in the cast! (Yes, because every girl looms has smooth skin-tight shirts and pants with blonde hair extensions!) She also thinks I should also be Tomboy. I would find this a little fun, but it's her Cliché, PUNS THAT RUIN IT !!! "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" the saying is spared too much !!! GIVE THIS GIRL A WRITE !!!! and give her a coffee because I am not mistaken, Jennette's play is okay, but in half of the episodes she looks as if she is ready to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Next we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is the technical producer for Carly and Sam's show! There is not much to say about Freddie except for the fact that he is a techno-geek and has an infatuation with Carly, who never works! Here we go again with Clichés !!! DO NOT STOP !!! !!!? Nathan's play is also okay, but seems to be excessive sometimes! He is also living !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my most favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Let me make it quite clear; IF IT'S NOT FOR HIM, THIS DIRT CLUSTER OF A SHOW SHOULD BE MUD !!! Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! Spencer is Carl's older brother! If you had a little 5 year old who was both on a caffeine high and constipated, you would have this character summed up! Spencer also earns money from being an artist! (Hmmm ... I wonder ...) You'd think a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... well, I just love sarcasm! His art is much much better! I mean, what kind of sculpture name is "FREE SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT!!? It's about just as much creativity as a healing spray clinic on drugs !!!! It is stupid !!!! <br /> <br /> THE GREAT SETTINGS AND MORALS ARE FUTURE BAGS OF POOPS! These shows now tell that children who steal, lie and are an asshole for your parents, are a good thing !!! IF THERE IS HORRIBLE CROPS, THEY SHOW TO BE ON THE KIDS OF YOUR DAYS, YOU DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF YOU !!! IT'S THE LARGEST POSITION OF KRAP I have ever seen on TV! BAR NOT !!! NICKELODEON, "I'm with you !!!!" THAT'S THE WAY IT IS!!!! 1.10
