You are Dead is an indescribably terrible attempt on a British gangster movie. It does not have a single original idea in it, being a horrible copy of various elements of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The plot and dialogue are utterly eerie, the plot is ridiculous and completely predictable despite constant attempts to plot twists and contains nothing but one-dimensional stock characters and clich√©s. It has some good actors in it, but they are out of shape and cannot do much with the terrible material they work with. It is absolutely torture to sit through this drift.
