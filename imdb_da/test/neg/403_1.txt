This is one of the movies you see because it's bad. Such a movie you just look to see that it is shitty craft. Probably a horror, I can't imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug, especially one that is translucent in nature, where you can see the actors' legs behind. <br /> <br /> Even without budget, a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt to make this movie credible would have sucked the fuss straight out of it as they would have to replace all the actors and the whole story with the. If I had nothing to do while playing, I would have stopped it after 10 minutes and put on some quality program like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAVE HAVE). I highly recommend Brett Piper getting with Quintin Terrantino and really pumping some stools. <br /> <br /> :)
