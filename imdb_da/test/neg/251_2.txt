This movie should have been billed as three movie listings linked together to form a full-length movie (including many pictures of people slowly descending into dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the protagonist. The actual movie does not start until the case is almost over. I must say that the overload of the bat is quite fun. <br /> <br /> For the robot, I thought a robot was a mechanical device that might or may not look like a human. The bat's "robot" consists of a radioactive resuscitated body encased in a conductive robot body. As Tom Servo put it, "He's not that impressive, he doesn't even have knees!" That, and it takes the robot about an hour just to timber over the room. But when he catches you, you should see! He will disintegrate you with a push (powered by radium? Fluh ease!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and Bots. Otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.
