This film is about the complicated friendship, romance and deception between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> Great efforts have been made to make the "Edge of Love" look the right time. However, I find this effort too exaggerated, especially in terms of color tone. Most of the first half of the film is treated so much to have a strong bluish tone. It is difficult to find out who is in this tone. <br /> <br /> Another harmful point is the fancy use of the image splitting lens. There are many scenes that have three or four pictures of the same thing, such as three Keira Knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace. It simply makes the movie confusing and difficult to follow, instead of being artistic. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it's simply boring. The way the story unfolds is not at all engaging. Sienna Miller's unstable character is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, making it an additional obstacle to understanding the plot. I strongly recommend avoiding "The Edge of Love" unless you only watch a movie to appreciate great costumes, pretty sets and lighting.
