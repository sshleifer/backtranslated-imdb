So I rented this movie in the hope of learning about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the beginning of its independence from the Belgian rule. I was thrilled to get acquainted with the numbers involved in its history, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to bring together the various groups of opposing colonial rule, the political motives behind each, the reasons for the Belgian decision to give the Democratic Republic of Congo its independence, and also how the United States and the former Soviet Union were involved . Unfortunately, all my questions went almost unanswered. My belief is that this film is made by people who, through a familiar knowledge of the history of the DRC's freedom struggle, saw a story full of drama and emotion and decided to exploit it. They then proceeded to fire all the dramatic points of a story, cut them out with dialogue, went to the set, and shot it. I could be wrong, but in that case it is more sad, because then the decision-makers must simply be too bound to get everything in, and ended up smoothing all the details in an attempt to create a comprehensive story. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the movie can be a timeline of sentence statements and facts printed on the screen. The film goes through every major occurrence and tells the viewer who blinks the main idea of ​​what is going on completely smoothing the actual details in favor of getting over the big things. For example, there is the scene when Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army ruled by Mobutu. In the situation, the soldiers have three possible views: one who sympathizes with Lumumba, one who disturbs Lumumba, and one who stands in the middle, sympathizes and nonetheless obeys orders. Similarly, there are three soldiers speaking in the scene, extracting lines that unclearly show their views. Then, in order to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposite views bring up, the manuscript simply wrote some random footage, several hosts show up and they just end up beating everyone. This is the extent of the film's reflection. Most of the time, each character simply indicates their basic motives, the other characters react with theirs, and that is it. There is little narrative through actions; Even the things they say are directly the point of painful. It is hard to believe that the people represented have actually acted like this. Also in the tendency of this directness, things like political tension between factions are reduced to simple recognition of fact - we never learn what these factions are, what they are fighting for, their power, just about anything but they exist. The signs are also one-dimensional and flat; unfortunately I do not know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter who was passionately devoted to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after an hour of the film I certainly had no confidence to tell me. The Democratic Republic of Congo, like many developing countries, has a complicated and important history, especially in the period up to and after independence. But the story of these stories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the complexity of the situation. Lumumba fails to pay attention to these details, and ends up telling the viewer a little, except for the most general outline.
