In order not to get bored with "Love and Sex", I first tried to think of all the movies that were imitating for: "Breaking Up" with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (though it was more original), "About Last Night" with Rob Lowe, and many TV shows. <br /> <br /> Other just admired how beautiful Framke Janssen is, so I couldn't believe in a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. She's definitely going to give Julia Roberts a run for her money, literally - and wasn't Julia in a movie with the same plot or something else? <br /> <br /> The third attempted to find out why the author / director plagued giving Jon Favreaus the character of the Jewish name Adam Levy; He even refers admirably to eating a ham sandwich. <br /> <br /> Fourth, trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review why I was in the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written 9/2/2000)
