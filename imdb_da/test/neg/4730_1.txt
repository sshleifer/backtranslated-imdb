Mmmm, a previous summary says "If you like foreigners and predators, you will enjoy this movie", I couldn't disagree more, this movie does not pay respect for its weighty relationship and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi beaches to a little more than a teenage horror slasher movie, it has no excitement or preventive presence in former strangers or predator movies, and there is no traceable main character, I really didn't care for any of the characters, and I was positively longing to see the stereotype cast dead as soon as possible in the futile hope something better would replace them, it really requires super human incompetence to have two of the most terrible creatures ever invented positively fail to make an exciting exciting movie, only see this to see how DO NOT do it.
