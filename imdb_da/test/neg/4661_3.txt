Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> I have found in my film studies that when Michael Bay makes a movie, people shower it and hate it, but they still go to see it and it does a place around $ 100 million. Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors at all times. Along with Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has cemented himself as Hollywood's best action / adventure director. This point has been proven with his most recorded film, Armageddon. <br /> <br /> An asteroid, the size of Texas is hurtling toward the planet, and the only way NASA can think of taking it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid, live to its core, and drop a nuclear weapon inside then blow up the asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough to do it: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, a grizzled hardened oil drill who tries to keep what is left of his family together. Not helping the fact is his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), who has an affair with her best driller, AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), the head of NASA, Stamper and his team of roughneck drills train to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part movie. First, there are the fun parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds. Then they come into the room, and all the comedy is sucked out through the window and replaced by thought-building special effects, cool music and great serious action. Murphy's law is insane in the second part, which means that anything that can go wrong actually goes wrong, increasing the excitement of the movie to outstanding levels. <br /> <br /> With a cold casting and crew (Michael Bay as director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as Producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the screenwriters.) Lots of special effects, good humor, great music and a post by Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon mows great time. Signed, the constant DVD collector, Matt Macleod. Parental Warnings: This is not a movie for children. The F-bomb has been used a few times, and many other difficult words are also used, plus there is a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part may be too difficult for a child to handle.
