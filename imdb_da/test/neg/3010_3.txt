A professional production with quality actors who simply never touched the heart or the funny leg, no matter how hard it tried. The quality cast, the strong attitude and the excellent filmography made you hope for Fargo or High Plains Drifter, but sorry, the soup had no spice ... or meat for that matter. A 3 (out of 10) bet.
