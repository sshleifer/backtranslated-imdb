This P.of S. was highly recommended to me by two friends who have great <br /> <br /> (similar to mine) taste in movies and have seen more than anyone I know. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie, but this is a windbag action that tries to pass itself as a highbrow lowbrow film production. Or is it the lowbrow highbrow? The old generation clich√© "no redemption of social value" comes to mind. Bill Pullman tries, perhaps a little too hard, and apart from the child, the rest of the play seems self-conscious and bad. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and see a double feature of "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher". As someone said, it would never have happened if Jennifer Lynch was not the overrated David Lynch's daughter.
