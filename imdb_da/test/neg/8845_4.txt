While design and locations and photography are powerful assets in this movie; It is a turgid and melodramatic affair that shows the cinema's boundaries to convey the truth. <br /> <br /> The case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber, who play constantly and loudly, and would have made Max Steiner grimace at its overuse as it instructs the audience where difficult; how ecstatic how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story elite the details at the end. <br /> <br /> This increased and kitsch-utilization of emotions was once well covered by Peter Ackroyd on a Yukio Mishima book: This is not writing, it's Barbara Cartland. Exactly the same criticism can be made of this movie: a fraudulent, mawkish vanity project.
