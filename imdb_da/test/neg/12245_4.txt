Spooffilm has come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said: "Don't be stupid, be a smartie. Come and join the Nazi party". It brought us lovely movies, like 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane!' And even 'Naked Gun'. But the good door young. Fortunately, the genre managed to make it right up to the late 90s. And then ... Wayan's brothers released the apocalypse: 'Scary movie'. Suddenly the word spoof was an insinuation for raw sex jokes. Most movies that claim to be spoofs since then have followed, including 'Scary Movie 2', 'Date Movie' and the movie to kill the 'Epic Movie' genre. Sure there have been some relief. There was 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Will Ferell has become a vehicle enforcement close to any imaginable sport. Wayans Brothers also ends up 'Scary Movies' and they are made by the reliable Zucker Brothers. While these films have had some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically doomed to be films that are only loved by prepubescent men who have just discovered what an erection is. People who haven't explored the word 'spoof' and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh. No heart, no brain, just cheap glue. Unfortunately, 'The Comebacks' is added to the list. Dave Koechner (who was in 'Anchorman' along with Ferrell) leads a team of underdogs to win against a coach (Carl Weathers of 'Happy Gilmore' fame) who got him back in coaching. Koechner has shown promise as a supportive actor, but as a leader in this movie he just sounds scripted. He sounds too much as if he is reading coldly passionately. Also, the jokes about being a washed trainer who, through the course of the film, encourage the team to fail in school and later run from the police in underwear have been done before. Yeah, it's a ghost film. But let's remember that even spoofs can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a sort of sophisticated view of modern society. Also, the dependence on stereotypes will not make us laugh (who knew a movie with jive-talking people could lead to gangster stereotypes (not really, but you see)). While I will admit to laughing at least a couple of times ... it was not on par. The football team itself had many stereotypes, including a Mexican, a cocky jock, a fat guy, the shriveled nerd and the mentally handicapped help. Even the only female on the team was reduced to stereotypical female humor, as they were mostly smartly dressed and delivered innuendos. In fact, her character, as well as most of the others, has never been developed. It's a sad state for this movie. If it were only so dependent on stupid sex jokes, it could have done something for itself. In fact, this movie will probably be the ham of the jokes along with 'Epic Movie' for the upcoming time. Koechner really deserved better. The script in general was poorly conceived, even naming the championship 'The Toilet Bowl'. So yes. spoofing film dies. There is a movie called 'Meet the Spartans' (be in front of the trend, boycott now!) That comes out that includes a spear on Britney Spears' collapse. So let these children continue to get erections ... but people grow up and lose them. We need nutrition. One day they will learn to stop spoofing spoofs and restore them. Hopefully, one of the heroes will be "Get Smart", made by Master Mel Brooks, coming out next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (Stars)
