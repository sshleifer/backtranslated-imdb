I have read all the free posts on this muddy semi-noir and am amazed at the fact that what works in the cruel light from 2007 is a very dull delayed RKO assembly product. All the infinite documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict, and just the paddle maturity. The editing is exactly careless: Scenes just end and are followed by other scenes that have nothing to do with what preceded them. The dialogue carries the silent traces of Odin's origin: high-flying metaphors that could never have come from the limited fantasies of these workers. But what is really surprising is how terribly abused the triangle is on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she spins and expects and wipes out wildly - an unexplained performance multiple notches below her standard. Douglas, who surrenders to be lovable, then enters a wild murderous rage and is also hammy, as Ryan spins and shouts most unnaturally. The less interesting other couple at least gives recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is a kind of neanderthal by today's standards, is nevertheless smooth and convincing as Stanwyck's (much younger, a supposed) brother and Marilyn Monroe as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On Monterey's windy coast (and all that Monterey footage, but essentially irrelevant, is interesting as a document of how the city looked), amidst all the overheated hysteria, these are two islands of hygiene. One last point and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office has a mandate, but does anyone believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may have temporarily regressed to be obedient, wife, but I give the marriage a month.
