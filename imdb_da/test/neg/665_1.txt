After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for any of those involved in making this immense movie. For one as a general comment, the storylin was literally incredible and filled with incredible clich√©s all around. Of course, the same goes for the dialogue that paves the way for the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The action was also horrible with Kane, who shows no more than 3 separate and different feelings throughout the film. Even the use of modern special effects failed, as each prop was easily distinguished from its real life counterpart. Overall, I would not recommend that anyone even think about seeing this feature, as it will definitely ruin 83 (not even 90!) Minutes in your life.
