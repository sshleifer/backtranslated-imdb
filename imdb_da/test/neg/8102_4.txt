This was a strange movie. A bit of horror and particular movie noir. Some fifth colonists meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) appears. <br /> <br /> Soon, Lone Ranger comes to person with FBI Agent Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective in finding the killer, as he is more interested in niches (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and this is where it gets interesting and weird. I don't wanna waste it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was wonderful as he was killing the killer.
