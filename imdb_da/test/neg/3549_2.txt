Ask yourself not to watch this movie ... It begins with a promise, and as it goes on, you want the movie to end ... Predictable, not entertaining at all, wasted movie ... Save your time and look better thrillers. ... Synopsis sounds good, and so I looked at the movie ... But it was too predictable with nothing to give you a start ... No great excitement .. no good direction ... nothing phenomenal with the actor ... wildly away from this ... low rating ... nothing to write about this movie so i fill the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time destroying this movie is ... really annoyed by how good a premise is there was and how bad a manuscript was written out of it ...
