This is one of the movies I watch every time it is on, not because I like it, but because it's so bad, I can't take my eyes off it (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland "). The first time I watched, I kept waiting and waited and waited to laugh and did not get my chance to about 3/4 of the way through the film as they stretch the harassing police to their underpants and hand them in the park in an unflattering position. Apart from that, the jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't funny, their mishaps and mistakes aren't fun. Add it, it's not a very funny movie! Not even at a slapstick level! And what about the reggae soundtrack? It's a movie about two white garbagem and the music is all reggae. Seems out of place, right? If you like a good trainwreck, it's for you. If you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
