I was recently in a scene version of this game. And on the last day of the race, I was thrilled to see it play on TV. I put a ribbon in as it was late at night and I saw it the next day. I must say I was very disappointed. The actors in the film made some of the discoveries found in the script. It is understandable as the reseller process is probably different, but it was terrible to see. Much of the original script was also changed to the movie to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure if it helped the movie at all. I only gave 4 stars because I know the script and the writing is much better than what this movie depicts.
