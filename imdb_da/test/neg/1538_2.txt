First, the movie seemed to do well, they had the character profiles set ... the plot seemed to be in the right direction ... but when the film was advanced, the director seemed to focus on the wrong kind of thing. .. or just a lot was edited from the movie. The character's identities changed worse within the film. There also seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had things in the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself. AND the title ... no where in the film fits the title of the movie ... I suppose the title works for the previews .... The actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a better director and author , maybe it would have worked better. But it didn't. So now there's a new horrible movie coming out on Friday .... My opinion! .... Don't waste your time or money.
