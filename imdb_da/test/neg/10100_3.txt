When Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphan out Indian who continues to become Tom Black Bull, a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways, Tom gets a white name and must adopt the white man's language and ways of living in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment of one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who turns Tom and acts as his boss. Red is a full one, which eventually dies in history, which is about where the film ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, developing a reputation as a killer of horses in rodeo arenas. Oh yes, you have to read the book, this movie does not come close to making history fair.
