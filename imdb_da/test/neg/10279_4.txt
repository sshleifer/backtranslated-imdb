"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slowly moving B-flick where Blake plays a desert motorcycle policeman who wants to be a homicidal detective and becomes involved in a murder investigation. A mediocre movie at best, "EG in B", contains some members of the Chicago band, a bunch of action, some philosophizing and lots of boring dramatic stuff. Not worth the time.
