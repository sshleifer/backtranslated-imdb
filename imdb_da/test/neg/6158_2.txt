This movie fails at many levels. The script is the first to fail, and as I understand it, if the script stinks, there is nothing that can fix it. The reason is boring, after the first 45 minutes I look at the counter on the DVD and say to myself, "how much longer?" The cinematography is pretty horrible. I'm not sure how bad the transfer was on the DVD, but it looked like a VHS copy. Also the sound was poor. I realize this is not going to be remixed to 5.1, but it doesn't even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo that had been around for almost a decade since they cut this movie. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was all too similar to both Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember, the point scene took place over the last 20 minutes, usually it should take place in the first 20. Most people will be completely confused with what the heel is going on until the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The music of the film was excellent in parts and so totally inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien made the score, but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' things elsewhere, as it doesn't fit the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.) <br /> <br /> There were amazing actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a good job of drawing the little vacant life into their characters. (Paxton's character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him. I'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the protagonist carrying the movie.) Again, it's a big mistake in the script. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, I saw this from a mail order DVD service, not the theater. Overall a big disappointment for Sci-fi fans, or fans of Paxton or Hamill. 90 minutes in your life you will never get back.
