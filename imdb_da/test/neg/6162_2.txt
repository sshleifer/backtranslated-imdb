They say David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. It sounds right. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying Saddam Hussein wasn't as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw has lived in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He's pretending to be French all this time. He reveals to his wife that he is actually American. For some reason it comes as a groundbreaking revelation to her, despite the fact that she has always commented on her husband's American accent. Also their son - remember, he was born in France and never knew his father was American - speaks perfect American English without a hint of French accent. It's just one of several great plot holes in this movie. Most of the movie is a flashback to Tommy's youth in New York City during the 1970s, explaining his wife why he has been hiding in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a retarded adult terribly played by Robin Williams. I suppose Duchovny thinks the "retard" is someone who is just stupid because Pappas only comes a little weak at times, while other times he comes out as just Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick, even though he has to play a person who is mentally slow. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovy's wife Tea Leoni, is a pill-popping nurse who is confused by her husband's recent death. Leoni does a good job, but she mainly smokes a lot and shouts at Tommy for things that don't seem to be too important. The scripture did not give her much to work with. Tommy is also kind with a lady (whom he calls "Lady") who is in prison and gives him advice through his prison window (this house of detention is called "House of D" for short and thus the title). Tommy has no trouble shouting his personal problems high on a village so that this imprisoned addict can give him advice, and he does so many times without care. <br /> <br /> I will not drill you with the full summary of the movie, but plot holes are abundant in this movie that is trying too hard to touch but comes out as, well, bad. Really bad Really really bad. At the end of this train wreck, the script becomes cornier and cornier and ends with a ridiculously crazy end. <br /> <br /> Critics tore "House of D" apart and rightly so. I can't believe some people actually like this movie. It is a painful movie to sit through, and I felt weak afterwards - not from emotions, but from how terrible it was.
