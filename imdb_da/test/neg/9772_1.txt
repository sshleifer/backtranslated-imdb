I think "Bone Snatcher" should go for someone who is associated with this movie. Seeing this looks like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The ground is dull and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrifying, even at a distance. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art right up to the end, you will either be very disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I would read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker. If you're looking for a horror movie that will keep your interest, see "U Turn". It can be based on a boiled plot, but it is full of scary scenes that keep you going from the beginning to the end.
