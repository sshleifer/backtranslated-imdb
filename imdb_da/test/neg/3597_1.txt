I don't understand humor in this movie. I also found it offensive on how the Koreans were depicted in that movie, despite how it is actually just a caricature of Koreans in these areas. First, the actors are Japanese and they make the most rude expression of the Koreans in that movie. It disgusts me how these people are expressed. I felt angry, just watching one scene and how they were so badly made in the movie. The mood just lasts for a laugh, and then you don't understand why it's just fun. It is raw humor with the most obnoxious representation of society there. I found it to be an offensive movie in general ... Maybe it was just because I never lived in "hood" or saw any "hood" movies, but I do not intend either.
