First of all, I hate these moronic rappers who couldn't act if they had a gun pressed against their forehead. All they do is curse and shoot each other and act as clich√©'s version of gangsters. <br /> <br /> The movie takes no more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we are already in stock There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brain. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadler's character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. I didn't like him right from the start. The movie is filled with meaningless violence and Walter Hill's specialty: People fall through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is virtually no plot and that is a big problem when you mess with none. Everyone dies, except Paxton and the homeless guy, and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only two black people who can trade are homeless and junkie, but they are professional actors, not annoying nasty brain killers. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. Because they don't have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.
