I've always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated it for me in college. This is not as bad as the Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing bottom of the lunch box than the mistake. This The Fantastic Four movie, complete with I-have-no-idea-why-hes-exaggerated-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue "Kill him! ... let him go!" is classic, as it is staggering in its hilarity. The editing is good and the director of photography is not half bad ... these are the top pages. However, I cannot submit to all my friends to see in its entirety, but if I can get the chance, I show them, "Can Jonny and Sue come to outer space with us!" scene I do. I also include the final scene scene where Redd Richards in his FF outfit, for some reason, along with his bride Sue in her wedding dress, comes into the limo ... payout is the extendo arm in farewell when they drive away. Most people are in complete disbelief that there is something like this.
