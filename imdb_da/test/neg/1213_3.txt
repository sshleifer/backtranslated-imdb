I was pleasantly surprised by this. It is actually quite interesting and engaging. Cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields has entered her own as an actress. Black and white must really have set her free because I have never seen her in this very command that plays a conventional character. If marketed properly, it could be a medium sized frame.
