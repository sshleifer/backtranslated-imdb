This good-guy vs-on-evil tyrant story set in 19th century Russia may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves' career beyond these "Hercules" films. Despite the different costumes, however, it is still a "Hercules" movie with the usual set dialogue, random dubbing and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there are lots of actions, the pace rarely flagged, and Reeves has to make yet another of the scenes where he is stripped to the waist, tied with ropes and given a powerful whip, which obviously has little effect on his needy Grade.
