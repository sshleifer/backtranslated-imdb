At what time is a movie so bad, is it good? The fate of the doomsday stands out as a shining example of c ** on cinematography, and for that alone it deserves some sort of prize. The plot is about the old battle of heaven and hell for the undisputed souls of the newly dead. In the case of Darkhunters, representatives of good and evil manifest differently as a bunch of cats, a hooded Grim Reaper figure with a flaming flame's face, resembling a cold-effect electric fire, a Philip Marlowe-a-like with a serious bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be publishing from Kwik-Save. <br /> <br /> The protagonists compete for the soul of a new dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely, a boarding kennel in an attempt to evade his persecutors. <br /> <br /> The reason is spread thinner than a dieter's sandwich with no sign development or attempt to create excitement. The action is ridiculous, which is comparable to a school game - although it would be an insult to many educational institutions. And the dialogue .......... oh, how my pages hurt! With the dead unsolicited souls described as "the unwanted cup of life" by the flame-glow, you wonder if Hell really is a McDonald's. <br /> <br /> But it's bizarre convincing, you just find yourself watching to see how bad it can be - in just over 80 minutes it's worth spending time on the unintentional giggles.
