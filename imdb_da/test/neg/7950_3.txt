I found this movie at a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. The interesting thing about it is that Camp Video bought the rights to it and beat a 1986 copywrite date in the credits. Anyways, plenty of odd facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not scary. To call this scream or a "thriller" is ridiculous. There was only maybe 5 minutes on most of what you would call horror in this 80+ minute movie, and it consisted of acting because it was HORRORIBLE! All the puns aside, the writing for this movie was also absolutely garbage, just as the special effects and makeup were ridiculous. No wonder it is such a fuzzy movie, probably the director has spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in a big pile so no one else could be exposed to it.
