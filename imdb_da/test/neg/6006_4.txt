This movie was really bad. I went to the theater expecting something exciting, and instead got the opportunity to hone my "guessing the next plot twist before it happens" skills. Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even gore was greeted with such a complete suspension of belief that it really did not add too much. The exaggerated clever cracking and cop's speech shop on the crime scenes made it all seem more fake. And the scene where Lambert's character struggles with the tracks and reaches his "investigative epiphany" goes largely to indicate the level of intellect expected of the audience - a little. It is probably the most annoying aspect of cinematography was the "X-Files" treatment: Every building in the movie, whether it was the building or a house at noon or a hospital, suffered from a lack of visible illumination (not to mention lacking patients' in case of hospital). I don't remember a single scene when someone turned on a light switch. It would probably have been good. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is really not an Oscar-grade actor, so I suppose you should take this movie for what it is worth. In the end, I have come to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this movie seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching "The Warriors". Otherwise, you are back with an effort that is boring and unoriginal, and nowhere near the same movie as the genre as "the silence of the Lamb".
