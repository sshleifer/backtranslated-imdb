The majority of this light musical story is located at fictional Midwick College, which Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) participates due to the great actress Grace Hayes, his real mother who fills the same role here and who manages to deliver his love interest through her secretary Mary (Healy) who is his real wife. Drably aimed at a faint manuscript, and also hampered by excessive clipping and poor editing, this movie gives some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and has fine twists of soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as a snack store proprietor and the dynamic tape dance Roland Dupree.
