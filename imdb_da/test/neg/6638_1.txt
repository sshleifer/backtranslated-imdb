"Chairman" is a ridiculously silly movie from the popular cartoon Carrot Top (also featured in the 1-800-COLLECT commercials). He plays a surfing inventor who comes on a man who has a flat tire. Top helps him out and a few days later discover the guy's dead and has given his company to the comedian. Although another was in Carrot Top's role, it would still have been bad. The wit (which constantly rigs all the way through) is terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "plot twist" should have been discarded. NOT SEE !!!
