I'm not sure what the director and editor thought when they edited this bad excuse for a movie, but what they were thinking about, didn't help this movie, only hurt it, and it hurt this movie. The action is for once not the problem, it is the horrible editing, scenes will end without apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people are cut off in the middle of the sentence. I'm not sure what the story was, but it wasn't really something, as what I saw was pretty uninteresting. Just bad around, a huge "Jaws" rip-off and not a good one on it. The MST version was fun though. 7 for that, no one for the movie itself.
