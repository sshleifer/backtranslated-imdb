I hadn't planned to see O12 because I didn't like O11 so much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robber with a sensational arsenal of stars. Still, I was talking to seeing O12 one night, and I was very sorry. The reason is not only boring, but also meaningless. I honestly don't even know what it was all about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more joy I can tell you. But even the boys who eventually came to report later to me that the plot continued to be terrible and useless. My advice: Don't look at it. Go look at Team America (hilarious btw ;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve. In my opinion, the most boring and meaningless peace is to be on display this year.
