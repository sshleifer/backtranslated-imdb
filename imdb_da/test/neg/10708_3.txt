This movie is terribly convinced. It is a low budget, poorly written, some pointless garbage. But Saturday afternoon I came across television on TV still bumping into my mind as one of the most entertaining I've ever used in front of the television. The slime in this movie is epic - maybe not Ed Wood epic, but close. The premise is hysterical (men are forbidden to be too dangerous and imprisoned in - haw! - football stadiums), the pseudo-culture is ridiculously bizarre (there is an underground sex trade with women dressing up as men to serve "deviants") and the title "Last Man" is a pitiful reincarnation of Rocky from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I didn't see the end of what I must assume was so dripping with sirupy "what have we all learned from this?" nonsense it would bring an urge to brush your teeth, but everything in the first two-thirds was so oddly bad, although the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest, it is still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy, stupid, brain-free sci-fi B-flicks.
