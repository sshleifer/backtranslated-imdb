Wings Hauser and son, Cole Hauser quit making a film about neo-Nazi bullies targeting a gay man and terrorizing a city. Wings play the hero and his real son is the villain. Very low budget movie that doesn't have many redeeming features and for some reason no one has seen it! Maybe because it is a very ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and the studio realized this! Maybe Wings Hauser himself has prevented the distribution of 'Skins' after seeing it himself! Maybe people just wouldn't comment on such a bad movie! Oh good! I generally like Wings and Cole as actors, but it was a movie they both should have skipped. Wings instructed, wrote and was the leading actor in 'Skins'! An extremely bad and stupid movie! 1/2 out of *****!
