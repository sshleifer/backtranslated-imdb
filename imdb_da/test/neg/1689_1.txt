I scare, despise and hate this movie with a passion that makes the red, hot gates in hell cold by comparison. it is nothing more than a campy, scary and utterly eerie trip down the memory channel to the eerie time of the 70s, a decade I was glad I was not part of whether this absolute pace is all there was on sale! <br /> <br /> The animation is poorly dated, not least with the sticky, missing frames and signs of big bulbs, this film is an eyelid. from the widow nod to the parents with the freakily gay seahorse, and it's tenant's hand gestures and kenneth williams-esque voice to the overtly unwarranted druggy hymn, High Cockalorum, this movie, I'm sorry to say is one that was forced on me as a child, and I have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me .... This terrible display of complete horror should carry an R-rated certificate, so disruptive it is in that content!
