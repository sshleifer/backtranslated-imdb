Beware, my lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: Filmmaker / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> Trustworthy thriller from the groundbreaking producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is "in danger" and Ida Lupino is the "woman" in this post in "woman in peril" style film. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a heavily wounded psychotic handyman driver (no, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely warrior, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to do some work around her house. Things go downhill from there when Howard captures Helen in his own home. <br /> <br /> Howard has a horrible secret, not that he could reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. Maintaining it, that is. He has an unfortunate habit of getting to and finding his employers dead. This is part of the movie's problem. The character of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he has been free to move from city to city unhindered, even in the year 1918 (when the movie is set). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, antisocial tendencies are discouraged by the smallest and most common things (a young girl flirting, lacking in war because he is being rejected for service). I do not know how he himself did it past the interview with Helen. There are other inconsistencies. If you were locked in your house with a lunatic, but left yourself in periods, could you not find a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan thinks I'm defeated by the material. It feels like he's playing over his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the dense burst of dementia have all been there - done - the robotic feel to them. At this point in his career, he had probably played this character, to some extent, ten times, and it shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I did not) through showed humanity types as if he were stopped in his traces of a music box and his affiliation with a group of children who would not judge him. Lupino just needs to act frazzled and in need, which she is more than capable of doing. <br /> <br /> The picture had one thing to go to it; What would be the final solution to the conflict? So, of course, there was a disappointing end that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Of little interest was a recurring motif where the camera would capture Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree). This indicated something that was going on or was going on in the head. Horner (1953's Vicki), who made his reputation in production design, does a good job of making the house a prison. Also credit, the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house. Ultimately, understands work from those responsible who all have much better movies for their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out of 4
