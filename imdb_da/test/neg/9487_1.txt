I've seen this movie and I didn't care about this movie at all. I wouldn't think of going to Paris because I don't like this country and its national capital. I don't like learning French anyway because I don't understand their language. Why should I travel to France when I prefer to go to Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently, the Olsen Twins do not understand the French language like me. Therefore, I will not bother France's journey, no matter what. I might as well stick to the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. That's all.
