I followed TV a day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas". Believe me when I say it was enough to get a good rating of the movie. The first scene I saw was the monkey, the child, the fat guy and the black guy who looked like Dave Chappelle, and flew around in a crop of sweets thousands of feet in the air. While everyone else was solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on a kind of drug binge, where he continued to shout something that looked like the English word faster. They then landed on a twenty farm long dock in Africa. After a heart felt goodbye, where the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the movie's "villains" seemed. They completely assaulted their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan jump out of the quay on the boat, which sailed a mere 40 meters away and caused them to sink their beautiful car into the Pacific. Having seen this movie, I have a new purpose in life; to find the midget that played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a jumping pen.
