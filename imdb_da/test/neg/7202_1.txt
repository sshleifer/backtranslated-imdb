It's just about the WORST piece of waste I've ever had the dissatisfaction with sitting through. The story was embarrassingly amusing, the graphics were horrible, and the actor ... I have never seen worse working throughout my life. A preschool class can come up with a frightening, better written and more entertaining concept than this. I apologize to anyone wasting their time on this movie, as well as the actors who agree to do the job. It was obvious they didn't get the right direction. The authors must have spent their time at the film school in the "back room" that plays the lead. Many professors wasted a lot of time on these two. I would really be embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
