I don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves. This film is a misdemeanor for all that we keep sacred and not in the good "artistic" way of insulting. This film becomes the archetype for PAINFUL dialogue, provided by even more pathetic actors.
