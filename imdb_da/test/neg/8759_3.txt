Well, I had seen a lot of reviews on this one and very promo always shows the scaling scene. But this flick is a tough one. And I mean it in every way. It is difficult to find a copy because it was a low budget-dependent release, and because MPAA was in search of every copy on VHS, it came out without a rating, but it had to be assessed for MPAA. So the copies disappeared into the underground scene. All the people involved in this flick never did anything else in biz. So it made this girl unique. VHS copies hardly ever come up on ebay or other sites, and if they do, you pay over $ 100 to get one. But because of American relations, I was able to catch a release on DVD sold worldwide. Limited, but it should be some kind of official. Occasionally, there are still some screenings of this splatter party. But is it worth hype about it? As mentioned earlier, it is a tough one to catch, but also to sit through. There are gory kittens who are necrophilia who are nudity but there is also a lot to talk between coppers. And to be honest, if you want to see the movie in 5 minutes see the end, it's a flashback in the killer's mind. The blood is flowing and it is actually a splatter party but not the full 80 minutes, splatter masses for 10 minutes. The quality of the movie is okay, sound okay, no elevator, colors okay, black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. It's okay to see it, but you never get scared, but it's one to see with your friends having a beer and a pizza I guess. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
