If you're looking for a movie that puts you in bed, the Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not what I expected to be, and the film even disappointed me. The cast list was pitiful, and the whole plot was pathetic and was not like the book, except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read the Heart of Darkness and they create their own movie in their minds, but those directors cut important scenes and add meaningless. If there was someone in the movie that was supposed to be of a particular culture, they should have used an actor who was of that culture. There are actors from all over, and I'm sure they could have found better fit for the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if that is what you are looking for, but the film was cheap and meaningless, and one who could make the movie as respectable as the book should have done so. If you want a movie that draws you in the dark, the Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
