Now the movie starts well, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when the whole plot is about Karen's (that was the name the girl right?) Pregnancy. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie It's really corny and the characters are really stupid. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is more stupid if the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or boy for the way he was used to her. <br /> <br /> Yet my conclusion is this: absolutely not the best celebrity comedy, just another movie like many others with nothing special, they could do better, but they ruined it if only the plot had taken another way, but they keep the pregnancy thing and they certainly destroyed, so finally conclusion: I do not like.
