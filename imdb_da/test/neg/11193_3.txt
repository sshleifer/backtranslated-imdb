First, separate the story from the movie. The story of another continuing war in heaven is good, very good. Religious theme films are not the most important choice for many people, but angels at war are. I really loved the story, and some of the picture's pictures gave me the opportunity to back it up as the angels' field on spikes .... awesome pictures. The real movie, however, was only poor, I can't find any reason for the protagonist - the priest-cum police are in there at all. The leading woman too ... no reason to be there, the protagonist dialogue was just empty, it had no substance, the story could have been told well without them. Now, some sterling performances, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen have drawn some fingers, even though their scenes were mostly with the lifeless leaders. Another thing I do not get from this movie is why it has native American rituals to cleanse the dark soul. The child who carries it is clearly of original American origin, but apart from the end scenario there is nothing linking here to that heritage. The reason for the dark soul itself hardly told, oddly, because the dark soul is the master of the whole movie. The story of its original owner (Colonel) is briefly touched, but not enough to understand why it is his soul that is the special. <br /> <br /> I can't find a rationale for rolling stage shoots in this movie either of the plains around 'chimney rock'. I get the feeling that they had a helicopter and wanted to get the most out of it, since none of the images have any relevance, nor are they consistent with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the sci-fi category more than it does horror. There were no real shocks or scare scenes, anything mildly gore and blood, but no fear element. So, except for 3 roles, damn played well, this movie is a great ole 'dud. Unfortunately, the dud factor outweighs the good working factor, just for many weekend players.
