For a series inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land right on that ass. 3 has always confused me and - with the risk of sounding like the terrible Hans Keller - I have often wondered if I miss the point. The story feels like a puzzle game that has pieces that do not fit the box and the result is that you spend a cozy evening at the fire trying to match sky that really is sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you resume the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. I know this review puts me at risk of being pulled to Whitby by teenage vampires who want to drink my blood while listening to Busted, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. I've always been a werewolf man myself.
