I'M BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Films <br /> <br /> >> Benefits: Absolutely no <br /> <br /> >> Disadvantages: I Don't even know where to start! <br /> <br /> Plot Capture: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, speaks and acts more like a live action cartoon character. It's the whole plot I got out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Notice: I remember when I was in the ninth grade of the release, and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even fun. All the characters in this movie are extremely tired stereotypes, the sound is only audible when music is played, and the movie looks like it was being recorded by a public access channel. Fortunately, I didn't buy this movie like all my other inner city degenerate classmates. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My judgment: Avoid this video as its a sexually transmitted disease.
