Bizarre. This film should be based on a famous photographer, but all that happens in this movie is fiction. I think it is trying to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it the primary photo focus. In the film, the wolfman moves into the apartment over her. She seems to be obsessed with him and falls for him. She puts her children and husband over the wolfman and even tries to incorporate him into his family gatherings. Some of the wolfman's freak show side kicks come over to visit and she interferes with them. It's all very bizarre. <br /> <br /> FINALLY VALUE: Nothing memorable. There's just something weird about a woman who makes her jollies shave the wolfman. I think you can find better movies out there.
