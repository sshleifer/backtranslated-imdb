I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I've never heard much about "How to hit a character" and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who thinks it's fun. This movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even though most of them will give it a thumbs down. At best, there are short moments of mild amusement, mainly from Don Knotts, who plays the same nervous underdog persona that made him famous. After the movie was finished, I was curious if my teenager could pick up the fatal flaw of this movie. We were totally in agreement: Prentiss Gates sidekick character was even more dumb than Don Knotts character. <br /> <br /> Please Limpet, restrained astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken movies are around to enjoy.
