The only time I think trawl through IMDb comments is when I've seen a duff movie. I think I'm looking to trust that it's not just me. For me, Lonesome Jim was a duff movie filled with incredible characters in incredible situations that hit paralyzing and boring against a creepy conclusion. So I check what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, alienated, as side by side with more star ratings and plaudits, let me doubt my critical abilities. But maybe I should check the settings for the commentary presentation, as after a while gushing down and I'm relieved to see appreciations that reflect my own. I feel justified. It is a rubbish film, it does not stick together and it is a waste night that sits through it. Law to be related spirits.
