In the light of the calm of this flick from the viewers, I must again assume the role of the role of punchbowl, which Lowell Weicker used to say, I scratch my head on the sheer number of happy comments. "The African Queen" this is not. The taste of the period is wonderful, yes. The action is fine, but no actor, no matter how great it can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly boring and insignificant party and dinner table conversations here, and I don't care how much it's taken from Joyce's text. Imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a Christmas dinner of a not very interesting group of people (it is not clear to me that it is a family that someone suggested) to listen to their worldly table speech, and You have the essential experience of this movie. Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but it is said to be infinite length. As I said, the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me. Talk about mysteries, see a good rather than this.
