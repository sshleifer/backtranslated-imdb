While going to buy cigarettes, the professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is abducted and forced to have kinky sex for many days by three hoodies. When released, the director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives him a cold reception. The disturbed and humiliating Daniel leaves the dance company and raises the obsession to seek the abductors. Daniel has sex with many women, whom he supposes to be the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The Book of Revelation is a strange movie with a promising beginning that loses its original power and becomes a kind of too long erotic soap opera or soft porn chic. The production is great, the DVD's cover is amazing, but the characters are not well developed, and Daniel's trauma seems to be excessive as most of the men would fantasize with the dream situation he was presented with. to become sexually targeted for three sexy women. The melodramatic development with Isabel's disease does not add any value to the plot; The open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for women's motive or title. It is very clear that the manuscript of a man's feelings is written by a woman. It was good to see the still beautiful Greta Scacchi again and her makeup eventually is impressive. There is a saying in Portuguese that could be translated into English as follows: "If rape is inevitable, you must relax and come." Daniel should have done this and spared me to see almost two hours of meaningless history. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" ("Revelation Book")
