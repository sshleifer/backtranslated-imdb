The worse movie I've seen everyone. Like the other honest reviewers, it's just an excuse to get naked birds with their juggers out. Don't get wrong, naked women aren't a bad thing, but there is another movie genre for it. <br /> <br /> Boyfriends beware. I sold this to my boyfriend as a classic bike gang party (due to reviews) being greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place. Relax in the chops for me. What makes me laugh most is all the dog bike dives you went to in the movie were full of models with the works cosmetic - which biker rods have these? They are usually a little haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs! Totally unrealistic. The action is horrible, lots of pointless hard and a complete waste of time history. Has anyone checked out Vinnie Jones' attempt at an American accent? It's as embarrassing as his football skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. The only reason you wanted to watch this movie is if you are a young guy who can't access p @ rn and has nicked it from their parents' movie collection for a couple of perverse kicks!
