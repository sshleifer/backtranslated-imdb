I didn't like this movie for many reasons - much live! It was interesting how they thought how the future would look like this, but I was very sorry to see it here. There was hardly any action. Although the classic orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The views were very creative. When this movie comes on TV, I want to change the station immediately. Not because it's a bad movie just because I know what I'm up to when I see this - complete and total boredom. It's a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into science fiction stuff ... because it simply wasn't right. Like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood half the movie anyway.
