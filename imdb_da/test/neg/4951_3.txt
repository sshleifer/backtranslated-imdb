Having seen "Still Life", a short film directed by Jon Knautz, I was really excited about his feature film debut, "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer". "Still Life" had perfectly addressed the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and I was eager to see what Knautz could do when addressing the horror comedy genre. The name and advertising material of the campuses suggested something like "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness"; A fun, gory, 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters. Though that was what Knautz was going to, he completely failed to capture any of the fun or entertaining values ​​that these films had. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horror battles that it is trying to evoke so big in the first place. Two-thirds of the maturity is primarily devoted to the film's hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and college student as he goes to class and tries to handle his uncontrollable outbursts of anger. There is nary a monster in sight for most of the movie, hardly a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at something horror-related. Although "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had subsequent volumes of gore cut out, they would still be entertaining. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's simply boring, which is the worst thing a movie of this kind can be. Jack Brooks himself is not that interesting, at least not enough to justify the amount of screen time he has given. Everything you need to know about him is revealed in the movies for the first ten minutes and from the time he does not knock the mass out of a monster (and he rarely does), he is not worth seeing. The film goes nowhere and follows him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates. <br /> <br /> Finally, things come up. Jack Brooks fights a few monsters, some heads are crushed, a few people are slaughtered, and then it is over. Just like that. All within a time span of about fifteen minutes. That's about fifteen minutes. The monsters are all quite inventive (and completely done in the camera), and there are some good gore gags (the best thing is to be a zombie head broken in), but after sitting fifty-five minutes of pure tedium, fifteen minutes won't cut . <br /> <br /> That's all there is to it. I could ramble on the play that is pretty well done (especially horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how creativity prostitution is a good recall for the days when movies didn't use CGI, but it doesn't really make it " does not matter. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is totally boring and while Jon Knautz of course has the talent to create a good movie (once again, the last fifteen minutes killer and "Still Life" was great, check it out), "Jack Brooks" miss the brand. It has its successes (plays, makeup), but they do not change the fact that it is not very entertaining at all. The screening I caught on this had the director and participated in participation. One piece of information I picked up was that a sequel was in development, and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to the "creation of a hero". My advice: run this and wait for the successor.
