Although this film has had a lot of praise, I personally found it boring. There are some good Brazilian sunsets, and the signs are credible, but the story of how they interconnect, though very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie here for a long time. The central woman takes up one man after another in a close knit way and puts primarily the interests of her children. As the different men's tolerance is stretched, we see their signs develop. The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent plays. It is a rare insight into the Brazilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep your eyes open.
