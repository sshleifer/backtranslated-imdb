There is a thin line between being theatrical and simply forced. Forced action. Forced take. Forced Plan. Even forced photography. There are people who say "The movie is evolving that way because it comes from Asia", but I see no form of forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a thin line between fiction (and every work of art it is fiction) and is just unlikely. In a more personal way, I feel nothing about the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I just can't believe in the fictional world that's been suggested. It just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through it you just don't click.
