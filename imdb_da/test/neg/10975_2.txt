I bought this video on a throw-out table in the video store, which expects a good draft in what was to be called an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I think I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a pan, but here goes. <br /> <br /> These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of much more worthy movies. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatrical public and all the great films that have contributed to their reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: is the joke about destroying the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this eerie scary flick? Can the reference to Austen classics 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' be anything else? How much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? Should we simply take it as a daunting misconception that all actors are gay and thus let their role-playing on the screen affect our lifestyle, also accepting their private gay relationships in our faces? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I say no to this one.
