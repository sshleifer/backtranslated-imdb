In fact, anyone responsible for this killer should be whipped, pulled and hung! If this is the big Eugene O'Nell drama is like I will never be the victim of seeing it ever again. There are so many things Error with this feature, where do you start? First, Elmer Bernstein's bombastic score is present throughout the film, even in the silent scenes, where background music draws from the character's motivations. Secondly, these characters are not pleasant people, and while some reviewers may enjoy that I personally did not like any scene where Ives ate the scene, but that was the way his characters were written: that did not like. W / Loren is it never quite clear if she is good or bad ?? and all her babbling about how she is going to change things back the way they were before the baby arrives ?? Well, I saw what came out clearly. Perkins is miscast, and then he plays the role of warming to Norman Bates (whom he played two years later) himself to blame for the murder at the end. Hokey! Third, this movie is a studio studio and it suffers because of it. The story would have benefited from space shooting to develop a sense of "place" with regard to the farm (which all the main driver fights over). Since it's filmed, there's no value to the property because the movie has a studio sound phase that doesn't feel convincing. This is a really horrible movie.
