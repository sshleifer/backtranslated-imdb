I watched this movie shortly after seeing Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. They both have good casts and good plays. They both have stock characters of sisters who are very different, an offensive founder, a woman friend / confidant, an emotionally inaccessible father, a dead mother and a surprising lover. Both films have the characters of life-changing realizations, and both films suffer from a kind of 'love conquers all' sentimentality. They both add a little titillation with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial backlash by Gwyneth Paltrow naked. Both films seem to have been constructed as if the authors of the works on which the films were based did market research and said, "Okay, there is a market for stories of relationships between women, so I'll write about two sisters with an offensive governor ?? In other words, instead of the drama that comes out of the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to suit the dramatic situation. It seems to be forced, the signs don't seem right, relationships are incredible. Saving the tensions between the characters is simplified with simple excuses, whisking away the year's acrimony, leaving everyone feeling warm and unclear at their end. It's just not right. Romantic fantasy. The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more overblown than Moonlight & Valentino, especially the founder's part. Sydelle Feller is so vicious that it is hard to believe that her father would stay with her or even marry her in the first place. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino, you'll probably like In Her Shoes as well. Enjoyable performances in both, actually bring the actors depth to their parts that go far beyond scripts' intricate sentimentality.
