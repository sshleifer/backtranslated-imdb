I have a love for these phrases on British social norms, and it is rare that you lose me. But our Better has lost me a little. It's a narrative about social climbers and their joy to break the rules, but I found it a little boring. <br /> <br /> I liked the Duchess, though she whines a little too much, and Constance Bennett fully plays the role of Lady Greyston, a role that Bette Davis could have played backwards. <br /> <br /> But movie comes to life in the third act when Ernest joins the party. He is so lively and fun (and in truth, there is probably more makeup than Lady Grayston). He gets the last line in the movie and it's a gas!
