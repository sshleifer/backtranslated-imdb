This low budget indie film redefines the word "blah". It will most surprise that this word can actually be found in the dictionary, defined as: "nonsense .. uninteresting, boring, lifeless". The movie redefines the word because I had to add to the four words: "PC crap", "pretentious at a pathetic level" and "meaningless". <br /> <br /> The movie is so hard to be "hip" and "in contact" with modern beautiful people-fighting-for-je-ne-sais-quoi behavior and "thinking" (do they think?). There is almost no reason to talk about it, even though there is one to sleep for. The phoniest and most politically correct thing about it is how a white woman is good friends with a young black stud, the black street sax player with a penchant for the clever advice and advice and the cool black psychic. Isn't it beautiful how the races can get together? Ahhhh ... Finally, the woman reads "poetry", which is no more than one of her boring "dear diary" entries. She gets a standing ovation (!!!), although in reality the hearing would be more likely than not drowsy in deep sleep. But this movie has a bit to do with real life, even though it is here that should happen. In fact, her "poetry" reading would only have been ovation if she had the feeling of including the juicy, sexual details. "And then I rubbed his big penis against my sweaty, impatient pink little vagina ..." Cheers! What's worse, the leading actress has a dozen scenes where she either baths or screws with someone, but they never have the feeling to show off their breasts, which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess. <br /> <br /> The black guy and the blonde, separated by one meter in height, join in: they look like a cheap variation of Rodman and Madonna (as if the latter two are not a cheap enough combination already). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in his "Miss America" ​​book, is the blonde. Stern writes about Eggert that she took out her implants. But I think when they took her implants out, they sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake, because she looks hungry here. The scissors player in a scene develops angel-like wings; He looks like smoker advertising angel food cakes.
