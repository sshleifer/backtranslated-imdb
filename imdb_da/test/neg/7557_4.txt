Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a traffic accident. The end of the story. <br /> <br /> "End of the story", that is, at the "end of any physical action". Not in that sense "end of the movie". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed by the neck down. When he discovers that he is unlikely to ever recover his limbs, he decides that he will die and ask the doctors to complete the medical treatment that will keep him alive. The rest of the film is essentially a long debate about the rights of the eutanasia and the injustice and the right to die. Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, it is presented here in purely secular. If Dr. Emerson has some deep religious beliefs, they are never expressed in the film. However, he believes passionately that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; Giving a patient the opportunity to effectively take his own life would be a surrender to the enemy and a penchant for that duty. Ken therefore finds in a "Catch-22" situation. He must be able to show that he is healthy and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. However, Emerson believes that a desire to die is in itself a sign of madness and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr. Emerson put their respective views deeply and sincerely, but it cannot conceal the fact that "whose life is it anyway?" simply doesn't work like a movie. At one time, movie versions of stage games were made in the same way as theater productions, but in the 70s and 80s it was often seen as unsatisfactory due to the differences between the two media. When games were recorded, the general tendency to "open them" by filming on site as well as studio sets was by taking liberties with the lyrics of the drama, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Brian Clarke's game, but I suppose this is a story that would work better in the theater than in the cinema. There is very little physical action; Most of the action consists of long discussions about a hospital bed, where the protagonist is paralyzed. Such a plot does not launch itself to the "opening device" at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talk at the expense of action. Although it is well written and there is some good acting, I am surprised that a movie is ever made of such a mathematical subject. 4.10
