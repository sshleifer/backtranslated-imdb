This is an entertaining bad b movie. In fact, it's really much better quality than many B movies. It had a consistent script, decent direction, movies and movies, and I've seen worse plays. The zombies were big, clearly there were Romero zombies, and were really an interesting zombie story. Of course not the Oscar material, and if you are not in zombie movie or b-movie, you probably will not enjoy this, but if you want you like this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good, though they never really explain how he can heal from shots and zombie bites. But if he has more than one line of dialogue where his bad plays are quite clear. <br /> <br /> It was a good end to it, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he ever saw this.
