As the characters begin with "unknown" identities, they are not identified by name, so you begin with the beautiful James Caviezel who wakes up in a store. He finds out that the place is locked. Don't ask - the windows are made with safety glass, and it's impossible to get out. Four other waking men make it a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in a "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with a "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as a chair "Bound Man" and Jeremy Sisto shot and "Handcuffed Man". Oh man ?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective amnesia. They think three of them are kidnappers, and two are victims - but they don't know who is who or who is. Forgetfulness is due to a pipe leak. Don't ask - it happens. Meanwhile, chief lawyer David Selby (as Parker) is sending his police to solve the kidnapping while one of the men's wives, Bridget Moynahan (like Eliza Coles) is waiting with great pleasure. But the gangster's gang leader, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots" is also on his way to the stage. <br /> <br /> As DVD synopsis says, "As secrets are revealed and led the excavation (the five men) must fight against time to find out who is good and who is evil to stay in live. "This story reads much better than it looks for movies, unfortunately. When the secrets are finally revealed and the memories are clear, there is no longer much interest in what has happened. Simply, director Simon Brand is a prerequisite for Matthew Wayne's idea, but they easily invest in the characters holding the short end of the stick. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (11/1/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
