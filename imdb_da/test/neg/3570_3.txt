I agree that the movie is not the best I've ever seen, but I would like to mention that the actors depicting Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the actual Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The movie, based on their famous split, would have been better if professional actors played parts. Many movies made in this time frame exploited the popularity of the Big Bands. Most often, the films were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade. Most of the film's audience didn't go to see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey play himself; they went to the plot and the music. I've never been much of a Dorsey fan, but the music is good even today. I will comment on a previous post about the actors who played mom and pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as Judge Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Ms. Allgood as Mrs Monahan in cheaper at dozen.
