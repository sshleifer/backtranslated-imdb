Before "Miracle on 34th Street" Maureen O'Hara and John Payne made this, this movie. I was supposed to describe it, but I can't find out how much this movie appeared. The subject of adopting a child and Maureen's disease are both very serious and sensitive issues, but it could have been much better than it was. It was so extreme in his portrayal that it didn't come across it all. Probably the problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie. (See my review of "A stranger in my arms.") The beautiful O'Hara was often seated with clunkers like this, another is Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews), which I might want to look into. <br /> <br /> If you have emotional ties to this from childhood, you will be nicer with this rather lifeless, colorless and defective movie. But for something in line with this, you might find his TV movie remake. It must be better. It must be.
