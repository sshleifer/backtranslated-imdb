The modern chapter of US Navy's elite submarine demolition team is called to do .... whatever they want, apparently. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen was made an officer. Already the story is incredible. Michael Biehn is his closest C.O., but he keeps Charlie on a rather long line, and one of the men pays it early by being beaten thanks to Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team uses their free time to commit court crimes. For the most part, an exercise in random fire and paper thin ethics, these particular seals can be better suited to serve as crash test dummies. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes counteract the stupid cases.
