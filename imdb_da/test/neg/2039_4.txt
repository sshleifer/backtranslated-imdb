Just boring, a little rough, a little disturbing, it wasn't terrible, but not too good. There is a good scary bit when the statue comes alive, although props for this scene. Not much happens and the film just feels kind of scummy. I was happy when it ended and I don't think this is a true story .... very surprised that this is about 6 on average.
