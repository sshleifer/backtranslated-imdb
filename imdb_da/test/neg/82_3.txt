STMD! It's not a horrible movie, but it's totally forgettable. The lighting is deliberately poor in many scenes and unintentionally bad in the rest, so you will probably get out of a view with headaches or eye strain. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The gratuitous nudity that is crucial to teen slasher flicks is of course there with the archetypal teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn't look like. What was needed was a smarter dialogue and more heavy humor. <br /> <br /> I don't really recommend using your time to watch this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just one scene or two showing imagination or humor, but unfortunately these are missing in this movie.
