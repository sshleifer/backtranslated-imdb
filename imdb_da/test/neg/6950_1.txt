I want to preface this by saying that I love watching bad movies that are entertaining. This movie delivers 100%. It's hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. It's full of crappy stock footage of random things in a city (people walking, traffic, skyline, etc.) who don't tie in anything. Then there are the too long 'sex scenes'. These involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of stockings on each other's bodies. These are by no means erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie. This is especially true of the shower scene, where two of the so-called "barely legal" girls who could not be over a day over 40 spray each other with blood, but there is also a crew member who sprays blood from the outside while one of the girls holds smiling at him. No one had to remember any lines to this movie, if they don't clearly read maps, then they have a magazine in front of those they keep sliding on while struggling through awkward dialogue. Then there is Mr Creepo. He throws Ed Woods name around as if he can somehow compare, but he is far from anything of that quality. He walks around a cemetery that bubbles around random things that went wrong in the movie, which really helps the complete lack of power that the movie was already underway. We couldn't stop laughing at this movie (except in the sex scenes where we were gross and occasionally horrified) <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 1/10 to go so far beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.
