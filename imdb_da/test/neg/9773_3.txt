The name of this movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. Desert deserts were interesting, but this film narrowed along with a snail's pace. It started off nicely with an underground hole and something came out, but then we tried to get involved with the lives of some very unlikely people. When they found dead bodies, or should I say skeletons with any flesh on them, did they begin to search for the reason why? At times it was somewhat different as something followed them in the desert. Some sort of black ooze or something that would start eating human flesh. As the meat was munched, a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining people. The reason for this black ooze we find out was pretty bad ants? Unbelieveable! Then the ending didn't make any sense. I suppose this movie's motto will be when you have an itch and see a swamp, kill it quickly before the ants' friends smell your flesh.
