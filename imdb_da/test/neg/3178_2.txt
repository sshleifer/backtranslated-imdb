There is no Esperanto in this movie <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, especially because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is mistaken about the languages ​​used in this movie. There is absolutely no Esperanto at all. It's almost all English with a few words of Navajo. Don't watch the movie if you're looking for Esperanto movies. Other options are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable), which has little Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (though completely mispronounced), and there are some Esperanto street signs in Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator". There should also be some spoken Esperanto in "Gattaca", but I've never heard anyone. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the other reviewer is right. This movie is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time elsewhere.
