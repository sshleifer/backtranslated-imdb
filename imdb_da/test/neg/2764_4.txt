Someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference of "presenting multiple phrases" and "screwing the audience over". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the plot holes; When they cannot find their way into or out of a scene, they just say "she regresses her past now" or "she crushes it now" and they think it explains everything. This movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a full blown failure. (* 1/2)
