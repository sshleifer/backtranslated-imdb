What an accident! Normally, when criticizing a historical film, it is always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in, which are usually added by the authors to create more "dramatic" situations. However, "Empire: Nerone" is a whole 'nearer kind of animal. In this movie, you are burdened with finding something that is confirmed by the historical record in the midst of the phony of nonsense and fiction presented as Rome's bad boy artist-emperor. And it is a shame because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all Roman emperors. His life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie. The producers of this root choose another route that only leads to scratches from an informed viewer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is depicted as a 6-8 year old boy when Caligula has killed his father for betrayal, moves his mother Agrippina and sends boy out of slaves in the countryside. "Ten years later, history resumes just before the Caligula murder. Fact: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four-year reign, and was only three when he was murdered; Nero's father died for natural reasons; Agrippina was briefly confused for bad behavior, not treason; and Nero was not raised among slaves but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. Okay, according to the authors, Nero is now around 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact, he was turning 4); Agrippina manipulates Empress Messalina's demise and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero. Then he goes out to conquer Britain and is poisoned by Agrippina shortly after his victorious return. Nero has been declared emperor, although he is still only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 A.D., two years after ruling. He lived until 54 AD Nero should have been 31 years old by then normal chronology, but actually succeeded to the throne at the age of 16. The story tells us that the five good years followed, "Nero ruled wisely and well under the leadership of the philosopher Seneca and the presidential commander Burrus. good action is fake Senatorial resistance to Nero began only when he began to show signs of madness and started killing senators for real or imagined treason. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's mother Agrippina Murdered her husband to make her son emperor. After a while, Nero kills her announcement and decides to kill her. In the film, he sends his hands Tigellinus to stab her to death. was a survivor and did not go easy, Nero tried three times to poison her, but as an old poison poison herself she was knowledgeable of all that and he failed, then he tried to crush her to death one by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber, but it also failed. Then he sent her on a boat trip on a ship deliberately built to fall apart and sink; as it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam to shore. Finally, he had killed her. Now everyone shows it would definitely improve this movie! <br /> <br /> Other errors are missing: Nero's lover Acte was not a childhood slave friend, she never told him, and there is no evidence that she was a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by beating his wrists while sitting next to a lake. Contract. Contract. The sources of Nero's life are primarily the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom were senatorial hostile to him and his memory. But the evidence suggests that he remained very popular with the common people, as opposed to one of the final scenes where he was pelted by the mob of vegetables as he left the city to commit suicide. Why did the authors and producers write an intriguingly interesting story with lots of good stuff for any movie and do this piece of crap? Oh, and did I tell you how cheesy the sets and costumes were? Laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> A star because there is no way to judge it lower.
