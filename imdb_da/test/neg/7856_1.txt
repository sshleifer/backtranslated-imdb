C'était complètement minable: à fuir absolument! <br /> <br /> This was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material and it was successful! <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie under any circumstances unless you want to have your ten euros torn up and pushed up your nostrils with a bunch of weapons, incredibly unpleasant signs. <br /> <br /> This type of movie clearly illustrates the gap that still unfortunately shares directors and audiences. If the individual (heaven forbid a collective could have perceived this dross) behind this had been thoughtful enough to see the version currently playing in French cinemas, he or she would have endured what I was forced to endure, and mercifully rewritten it or just scraped it completely. The wind of adult humor that gets mined here, in my opinion, dates back to Fritz the Cat, but lacks the movie's avant-garde status or even its basic attempts at social commentary. <br /> <br /> With the proliferation of remakes and increased reliance on existing material to fund storytelling these days, one would hope to choose Snow White and thus not have to worry about perceiving signs or a radically new story would have allowed more time for, oh I don't know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent movie that has something to say and doesn't telegraph its vacuum from the opening frame? <br /> <br /> A apparently scary production.
