I expected a documentary that covered Sci-Fi in 1950-1965, and received a great ol 'commercial twisted with leftist political induendo by James Cameron and film mogul baby boomer pushing his own works. 'Watch the Skies' has previously referred to the films 'Giant Bug' and 'Space Exploration' from the 1950s, including such favorites as "Earth vs. The Flying Saucers," Thing from Another World "and" Forbidden Planet "as" them " , "deadly mantis" and "tarantula." There are lower budget examples that are rarely mentioned as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> This would have been a much better documentary if the few remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors plus the non-Hollywood boomers of the era had been interviewed. I only wish there was a "0" rating, as a "1" is much to generous .
