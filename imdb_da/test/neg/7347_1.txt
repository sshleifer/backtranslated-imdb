When I first saw this show on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read a lot of good messages about this show and I decided to watch it. The show was so boring. Each episode was predictable. More, this show has no logic. Hypersmart girls who go to school and sometimes do such stupid things start 99% of the episodes with a monster attacking Townswille, then mayor (he's a real fool, he's not funny, he's so stupid that I'm not can imagine how he became mayor). Professor, yes, should be the smartest person in this show, but actually ... He even found no difference between monster and his brother. The narrator's comments also make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and at the end. The animation is also very strange. Everything except the main hero is shown in a nasty way. Also in every epsode, this show gives you some life lessons, and that means it is oriented on young children, but if you look closer, you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
