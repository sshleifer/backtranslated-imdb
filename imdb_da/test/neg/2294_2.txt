Occasionally I like a good horror movie, so I thought it would be a splatter and gore movie. but it was a boring boring movie, maybe because I've seen a cut version, because there are only two things where little splatter, sometime some cut down some arm and where someone shoots one arm, but the only one thing. Wismaster, for example, had more cool tendons than evil oath, it is more a dull oath than an evil oath. and some actors how miserable at.o
