Talk about marketing. Poster / home video cover of 'The New Twenty' sends a half-naked man in a "Wolfe Video". For those who are familiar with gay movies? this is broadcast a "must-see". (I loved reading a reviewer (from another site) stating that they had been "tricked" into seeing a "Sodomite" movie. Are you serious? The tag itself as the word "gay." The Lord gives you eyes but you can't see ??) When it is said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: the lonely homosexual, AIDS victim homosexual and the closeted gay) it is more about long-term friendship and characters, growing apart. In fact, if there is something, there is more (here is one for Christians to complain about) heterosexual couples having sex outside, gasp !, marriage. Not to mention backstabbing, drinking for excess and drug use. I see this more of one made for TV-Logo or Showtime movie than big screen input. Well, I loved the filmmaker, some of the actors could act and I always love to see a large group of friends who actually seem to have known each other for a million years. But we've seen all this before. Nothing really "new" here. Barely an original idea ?? thus bringing back the same 'ole' I have AIDS, let's do it. "For a large part of the movie and boy, our friend has a serious drug problem, but let's not do it until it's almost too late. It's so (USA)" Queer as Folk "and" Broken Hearts Club "respectful. deals with a group of college comrades who now grow (in size not mind) who eventually have to grow up and each try their best while failing. at least the heavier put Ben, Ben, he stole every scene, but again there was not much to take.
