When I saw this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in my head. The play was terribly swelling, and it was bad acting. The most brilliant piece of play throughout the movie was the guy who had to play out-of-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I expected this movie to be a real tragedy, with a deep psychological plot in the aftermath. Around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no end, just wandered over and over, and the plastic bag got worse. Let's get real here. This is a horrible movie.
