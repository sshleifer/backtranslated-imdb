I have seen lots of waste in every language on every subject and every tendency to film production. From each period, each director and any kind of budget available. That said I really must declare: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst movies I've ever seen. It is painfully bad. It's pompous. It's cloudy. It is incomprehensible. It's annoying. It's a really bad mess. It's a piece of you-what-what. <br /> <br /> What's more important: it's missing a point. And even though it had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it is impossible to ignore the lack of coherence throughout the matter. <br /> <br /> It's strange to be weird. <br /> <br /> I actually felt sick and looked at this bin. The theater where I saw it (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. At the end, half of the audience had gone out. There was a Q&A programmed at the end but no one stayed. With the exception of about two sickos, everyone else ran to the door, even included. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours in your life. This is probably one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie in hell, this movie will play 24/7 for eternity ...
