Tom and Jerry transport goods by plane to Africa. But being white men is worried that they will not be safe, so they put on blackface to fit in. When they do, they adopt the black dialect and fully occupy their new characters. They rush into the sea and use the plane's wing as a fleet. Before landing, they suffer the advancement of a convincing squid and more serious danger from sharks, swordfish and whales. Once on land they are afraid of amazing creatures, and duck in a hole. Inside, it is even worse when they come across live skeletons in the blackface. And by going out of the cave, things are even worse than that when discovered by cannibals. "Plane Dumb" is a particularly sloppy bet by Van Beuren Studios. An example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, goes into the cave before they do it.

"<br /> <br /> They shouldn't have bothered. The raw animation and poorly executed gags make the movie a loser from start to finish.
