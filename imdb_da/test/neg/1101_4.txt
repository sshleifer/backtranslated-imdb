After spending all of her money to care for her terminally ill spouse, she recently moved widow wife Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to her late husband's run-down family home in rural Pennsylvania, where local legends talk about zombies moving the forest at night. <br /> <br /> Just seeing the names of this movie's writer and director in the opening credit was enough to send up shakes on my back: Boaz Davidson is the "genius" responsible for scripts for such STV titles as Octopus 1 & 2, spiders and crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the godly 'video nasty' The Slayer and the boring vampire flick The Forsaken. With such a dubious talent manager, I do not expect much from malicious little things. <br /> <br /> And when I'm finished with the movie, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the movie looks good at times, with the wonderful use of the creepy forest landscape, and the casting gives reasonable notions with the clich√© drive they are working on, the plot is so unemployed, poorly written and derived that it is impossible to be excited about. Most importantly, it may not be that the film's murderers, undead children who travel every night from the mine where the dead are not at least scary, a smudge of makeup, black contacts, and some crappy joke shop scars do little to add to the feeling. of threat. Scout Taylor-Compton and the firm are doing their best to look scared of the tiny terrors that convincingly confront any confrontation, but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience are too little use: the little blighters just have nothing It takes to relax the blood. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of unclear zombie chow scenes in a futile bid to win over gorehounds, and the final killer who sees the victim's blood pressure both Compton and Heuring is appropriately tasteless, but overall Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) instantly forgettable trash? Just another clunker in the movie cartons Cardone and Davidson.
