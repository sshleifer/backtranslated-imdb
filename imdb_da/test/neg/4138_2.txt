Where meaningless, hideous characters and boring movies. Saved by short sex scenes, crazy witch, beautiful desert island and Brooks body. The reason is unclear, the signs are superficial and odd. That said, I managed to see it all, mainly because I was completely transfixed by jiggling and kind of hope that her character would come in at last. The film was well shot, well directed, but perhaps cast it in some ways. Disappointing. In fact, the summary summarizes the first line, but this site dictates that you write the 10 lines minimum. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
