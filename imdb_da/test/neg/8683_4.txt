In this silly symphony, a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city. Most of the short ones are the two mice that explore the dining table. The animation is fine, where this short sufferer is in the absence of humor. Maybe I've just seen this "dining table adventure" in too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Although it did come first, I didn't find it that fun.
