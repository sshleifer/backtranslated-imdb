The year still has three weeks to go, but unless a really horrible turkey turns out before then, Passion Of the Mind can be the winner of my coolest movie in the annual competition. An interesting idea poorly done. And for that matter, Demi Moore is very good at curling her lip and smoking cigarettes, but is it all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Have Ligit and Myers or one of the other bad boys of nicotine got some of their illegal profits invested in this production. It is confusing, silly, and moving in the hectic past with an arthritic worm. I gave it a 3. Would have been a 2! <br /> <br />
