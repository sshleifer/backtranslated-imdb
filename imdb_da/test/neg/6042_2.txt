Someone said that WEBS is much like an episode of SLIDERS, and I agree. Spoilers: I have never seen the actors on sliders and have rarely seen it unless there was nothing better. WEBS is that kind of movie to see if you have no other choice. Read a book. WEBS have these kinds of TVs have been actors who look as if they are there as part of their PROBATION or Work Release Program. Some low-budget television films have actors who at least look enthusiastic. The actors in the WEBS look like they got paid the minimum wage and worked on a clock. They have the desperate, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce" look. The Queen Spider looks good except it is rarely seen and there are no other spiders (and no webs). The Queen's Spider bites people and they become Spider Zombies, which means they are trying to keep their eyes wider when they attack humans. The people all struggle among a variety of reasons, and they are not sympathetic. Having met all the "people" I would have recommended the charm of the school to the characters. All that WEBS made me feel was APATHY. I was numb for the characters and hoped for some interesting gore and special effects. Gore was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen who looked good. If the WEBS had a bunch of Spider Creatures that ate people, it would have been more entertaining. Apparently, they could only budget "spider-zombies." WEBS is a sad entry into SPIDER-oriented movies. It can qualify as the worst Spider movie ever because Eight-Legged Freaks had great special effects.
