When someone tries to tell me they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movies that are "cool" to hate, like "Manos, Fed's Hands" or "Avengers"), I ask them, "is it a movie about a orphan who is constantly trying to kill adults? Does anyone say the line" I'd rather eat a ride "in that movie? '<br /> <br /> This movie is WAY for infantile and moronic for adults and way too violent and irresponsible for kids. Is there so much money in Beavis and Butt-head demographically making a series of movies like this? There is a problem child 3 but I haven't seen it I would rather eat a turd.
