"Quintet" is certainly not a movie, most would find entertaining or even interesting for that matter. There is no scene, dialogue, action or plot development that would light a spark. The icy world is one thing, but the confused plot is something you really can't bear. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there are no emotions, and there is no meaning in anything that goes on. There is a world encased in ice, where no one does any meaningful work, except to play the Quintet, and the rules of the game are never even suggested. The homes are not heated even though there is electricity, but who and what produces it? There are wood, but there are no animals except dogs, so where do you wear clothes or shoes for that matter, as apparently there is no industry and everyone is dressed like in the 16th century in Europe, which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic pavilion background. The whole movie sticks to Altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the audience. Destruction or hopelessness has nothing to do with the lack of appeal to this movie, the world of George Lucas 'THX1138' is not brighter, and characters are no longer fun, but the story has its way. In the Quintet there is no obvious or even implied path, and in my opinion it does not even evoke the thought of everything, such as similar films, John Boorman's "Zardoz". It's not even done in Altman's unique style, so it doesn't appeal to his fans either, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even for him.
