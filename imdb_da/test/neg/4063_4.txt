I would have given this movie a star voice if it wasn't for the laugh I got out of it. Some of the dialogues were just as clever that they make you laugh !! How could anyone have actually talked like this. Not to mention the fact that bodyguard Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 as a pro and Michael Pare's team of whiners could dig a trench filled with gasoline and burst a large block in time. Has anyone noticed the lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with the guy saying "boss, the plane !!" to Michael Pare like 747 comes to mind. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers. Not to mention that the chief captain deserved to die the bad death he did to be such a joker !! Imagine escaping being bound just to be shot by a "crossbow". Hey. <br /> <br /> The bad pilot probably died in the plane while everyone ate steak and had room !! Just for laughs they have to make a sequel to show us how they all stay in the middle of a category 3 hurricane at Neptune Atoll. I heard Michael Pare call it the "best honeymoon resort in the Pacific." Now it would make an interesting movie !!
