I grew up watching sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc. In other words, mainstream television. Over the years, many sitcoms have come into the air, and of them a very small percentage is really beautiful and fun. The war at home is an excellent example of the majority of modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give the show a 3 out of 10 because that's what it is supposed to be a comedy, but it doesn't seem to go out of its way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should make you sweep your feet with its big jokes, you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in TWAH I see pretty much any joke coming. The characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes I have seen on the screen yet, and the play is not very good, afraid of the father depicting a stereotypical beer drink that loves American idiot perfectly. <br /> <br /> Poor plays, incredible characters and jokes that do not guard you, detract from this show to a point where it is unmatched. If you do not have a cable and would like to see a comedy worth seeing, try Boston Legal. It's more worth your time.
