I love his martial arts style, it's fast, close and oh so fast, but it seems his movie is becoming more and more crime-based quality of life and less meaning ... I thought he was out to produce a deeper message . At least some of the films had a hidden meaning or agenda, this had some good redeeming qualities of the character, but the rest was so far away. I was very disappointed. The martial arts also suffer. I hope to see a more devoted Segal in his future movie. This movie also lacks to keep the storyline going, there are too many holes so the tank is lost. Too many things are cryptic without a solution.
