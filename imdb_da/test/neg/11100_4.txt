This was a pretty boring movie, actually. I think the problem of a French horror movie is that the French must be easy to scare or something, because this movie was not just scary. The special effects of the mum's ghost looked as if they didn't even belong to the movie, as if someone put them into post-production to spice them up because the actors hardly respond to them. <br /> <br /> The reason is just a kind of meanders that are the opposite of true storytelling. I suppose this was based on a French television series where they were to distill it down to a two-hour movie. The plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the Louvre, which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it several times. (So ​​that's how people continue to steal the Mona Lisa!) The girlfriend and police officer from the 1960's version of this movie come together and try to practice the demon. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure if this mom was a bad guy or not. He kills two guards during the film, but he just wants to get to the afterlife.
