Movie title - Tart <br /> Date of review - 5/26/02 <br /> Year of film - 2001 Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (hardly), Melanie Griffith ( hardly <br /> <br /> NeCRo's Rating - 4 skulls out of 10 <br /> <br /> Must contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Plot <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain wants to be with the "in" group and then she leaves her real friends and joins them ....... very annoying rich people speak up. Acting <br /> <br /> I think I got what I wanted for Dominique to be ok, but man, the rest of the throw besides maybe Brad Renfro was bad or at least not interesting or sympathetic at all. I know some might say the others were good because they made me hate them .... believe me .... I like unlikely signs, but this group is unlikely because they can't be convincing bad people. <br /> <It shows that the only other people I got this for were barely in it, and that's Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had, they were ok. Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good sign, even though it was small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly under attack from horrible dialogue and very very annoying characters, it's violence enough !! ok, there was a bludgeoning with a rock which was ok. <br /> <br /> T & A Nudity Factor <br /> <br /> hahaha, they couldn't even add some nudity to help spice up this movie, probably because nobody wants to wear their body for this crap. If they are to expose themselves, they should do so in a movie where they are remembered as their character and not for "oh hey, I heard she gets naked in this." <br /> <br /> Overall picture of movie (review) ok ok I know that I am proud to be the person who likes the most if not nearly every movie or at least find something good in it. Well, this movie is one of the few I really struggled to find worth inside. The problem with this movie is that it's so terribly annoying. I already have a profound hatred of snobbish rich people's attitudes, and neither did it. All this movie is real, is just a bunch of rich people sitting around, acting depressed and stupid. I can't emphasize the annoyance enough. This film tries to rehash the tried and true "In group" plot, which can usually be done ok, with a little trouble. Why don't I have a picture from the movie or box cover? Well I felt that this movie didn't deserve that glory, so I decided to take a picture of the reason I rented this, and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain. Yes, I also got mad at her in Lolita and thought she was so good that from that time on I decided to check her out in any movie she's acting. In any case, I keep my promises and yes I have seen most of her movies, minus a few hard to find them. She herself is a great actress, and I would defend her actively, but man she chooses some of the most crappiest movies to steal in. This movie and smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness, but at least Smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some really good scenes. The DVD box also tries to trick you into thinking that this movie also has stars in it by putting the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips on the front of the box. If there's one thing I'm out of, it's a movie that patches the names of stars on a box to make you think "wow it has ____ I wonder how well ___ is in this, I saw ___ in that movie and thought she was great! "only to have the big names in the movie for maybe 10 minutes in total 2. Bijou actually had a part that half meant something. Melanie, on the other hand, has only 2 lines over .... Attributed I don't like Melanie so much, but it's about ethics and not starry. Out of all this mess, though props have to go to Brad Renfro to make a good performance with Dominique. Brad can be a very messy child in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this movie gets skulls is because I got what I wanted most, as was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I also had the extra pleasure of watching underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more. So even though I was annoyed everywhere, I still came up with some positives, even though it was pretty hard this time. I only recommend seeing this if you have seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are a spooky fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be heavily depressed. Also, if you're a fan of crazy movies like me, don't assume this is a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty for the money you spend to buy or rent. <br /> <br /> Some movies are "so bad they are good" as it says. What they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (to pass up)." <br /> <br /> NeCRo
