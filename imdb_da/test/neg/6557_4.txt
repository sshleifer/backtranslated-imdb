I have been a big fan of the company's original crew since I was eight years old. I saw all the movies and appreciated each one for what they kept from the old series and for further developing the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Even in the "Undiscovered Land" I thought the characters' aging was well handled and the story was worthy of a theatrical release. But having said that, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is easily the worst of the series with the original crew. I agree with many that the fellowship Kirk, Spock and McCoy are handled well, but the overall script, the direction - of William Shatner - and the special effects are not worth anything other than a television episode. This is a "buddy movie" and sometimes almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The action sequences are not persistent and therefore build little or no tension. The dialogue is weak, although it gives a couple of laughs both calculated and not calculated. Klingons seems to be thrown as an afterthought. The whole "Sha-Ka-Ree" concept is just silly and Laurence Luckinbill, a fine actor in everything else I've ever seen him boarders on the absurdity of this movie. The scene in which Sybok evokes images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain breaks the image of the characters that we have known them. Spock would never be a party to such stupidity, and McCoy, who is trying to save his father, is full of outrageous, superfluous dialogue and completely wasted DeForest Kelley's play. The whole scene is wasted and shows us nothing new and nothing we will see from these figures. I understand that Shatner did not want to work with ILM for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but it does not allow such a bad story. In some respects, I think this story fits into the old series, but the films, including "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", are much better quality than this. It's a shame that most other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. Focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is great, but far over used. The old staff really seem to be out of character. I liked the old Klingon General and the sultry Romulan at the bar. I liked some humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but it's about it. If this was a TV episode, I could accept many errors. As a movie, it's just bad, uninspired filmmaking. It's also a shame because I want this movie to be good. Although it was the level of "Star Trek III", I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series work like works by Shakespeare.
