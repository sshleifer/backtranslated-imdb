My roommate and I have another friend working on a local Blockbuster Video. He finds really horrible movies for us and tells us about them. One of them was a "Christmas Horror" movie with the first professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as a killer Satna Claus. We didn't see it immediately, but we didn't think that could be any worse. Apparently we were wrong. We were shown this slasherfilm "starring" Ken Shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow. First, we thought Ken would actually be the murderer scarecrow, and therefore we wanted to see, but he wasn't, and it made the movie even worse. What absolutely RUINED the movie was teenage drama. If you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, never ever see this movie.
