SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality), but I didn't expect this to be as painful as SHRIEKER would see. <br /> <br /> It's just awful. Bad play, confusing script and direction. Annoying signs I wanted to kill. It all was probably done in a week. I have seen episodes of CHARMED that were more complex and convincing than this one. <br /> <br /> It has the look and feel of an outdated episode of a poorly thought out television series that no one has ever seen. It was a task to look at and I could feel my mind getting darker and brighter at the moment. Watching a movie should not be so much hard work.
