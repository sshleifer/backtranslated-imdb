It's boring that some find this movie worth seeing. I'm Russian and I'm angry. There is nothing in this movie that deserves praise, except filmography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this movie is poorly designed and corrected. There is nothing more annoying and even scary than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this waste art). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers of a pervasive evil, and he managed to create a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive management work. I will never advise any of my friends to see it. Huge disappointment!
