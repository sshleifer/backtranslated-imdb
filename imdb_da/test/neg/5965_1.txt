This movie is a complete and complete waste of time, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And coming from me, it certainly says something. In fact, I wish I could have given the negative stars instead of just classifying it as a pathetic one-star horrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find legend about chupacabra interesting and I have a feel for cheesy horror flicks. But I draw the line on this one. <br /> <br /> The action is sucked. The leading man gives one of the worst performances ever, looks and sounds unnatural, as he delivers his poorly written lines. The head woman gives a slightly more tasty performance, but it doesn't really take much. <br /> <br /> Chupacabra ... well, considering how low the budget this movie may have been, the creature was acceptable. However, it looks like someone in a mask and body suit. The mask is quite detailed and can look cool in person, but not on the screen. <br /> <br /> Talking on the screen, you would think they could have at least used a better camera. It seems that it was shot with a camcorder to cry aloud. Not a good one either. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the writer of this abomination thought. The dialogue sucks and just ... I can't describe what I feel about it. At least not without getting into trouble with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It's just not worth it. If it comes on TV and you have nothing else to do or see, * find * something else to do or see. Read a book, listen to music, * everything. * Don't just submit to this. If you do, you can't say you weren't warned. And for the sake of the Lord and the wife, don't rent this sucker. It's not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. Believe me, I know.
