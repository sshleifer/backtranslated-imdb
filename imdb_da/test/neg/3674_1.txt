Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this movie - lucky for him! He may play 30 seconds of screen time, and his role is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie I couldn't tell you what role he plays in the movie !! ?? OK ... they suck you in the first hour by immersing yourself in dark underground tunnels. Spooky movies filmed in dark underground tunnels simply suck most people in for the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then you will start to wonder: "Why do I see this?" I remember thinking how easy it should be for an instructor / writer to use dark underground mazes to make a movie. You just have to film people walking around in dark tunnels and you have instant "excitement". But this is where this movie no longer goes! We all wonder what bumps into the night, but there's nothing out there in the darkness of this movie, but more dark. The story is even worse. Apparently, there is an underlying story to the movie that I learned to "watch" the movie. But the film uses so little dialouge that it never came clear during the screening. I still don't understand what the author / instructor has said. Some children caught underground by a misguided sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time - the same time as the signs? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie that drew me to write my first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
