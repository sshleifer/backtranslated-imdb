I gave this movie a four star rating for a few reasons. First, I felt that this movie was certainly the sermon, and I hate it. Still, it's my own fault to see a Christian movie in the first place. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something like a spiritual battle, someone opens a kind of border that lets demons into our world and the like. Something I'm very interested in, actually. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this movie is two couples abducted by a group of terrorists to become victims of experiments. But because their experimental serum comes from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, the couple's men can now feel, smell, hear, and see the demons of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently, the taste experience is not present in the kingdom. <br /> <br /> This movie is very clich√©. They took the title seriously as the men, while chained to the beds, demanded that their women look behind them because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although it was a good bet for what it was, I think the special effects could have been made so much better. The demon claws on the woman were in a word fun. The wife was uncomfortable as hell, and everyone in the living room almost cheered when she died. We hoped she would be beaten by the other woman with the chair. <br /> <br /> The message is one that I don't care to comment on, except that I think the Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it. And then I give it four stars because it's not the movie's fault, I'm not a Christian and don't like this kind of message, and I got a kick out making comments all the way through. My friend and I watched this movie seem like an episode of MST3K.
