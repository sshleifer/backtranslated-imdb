Do the authors who evoke these "comedies" write such empty lives that they embody them in tragic shows like this? Why the talented and beautiful busy Phillips is among this bin is beyond me, I can't stand the Spanish-speaking girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as the other African-American girl with the sharp voice. The forests are often stupid, the Jewish guy shouts a lot and the show never goes anywhere, a particular episode with the more solidly looking for love was just awful. I don't think there would be so many people working in a look for love office and just a man? Of course, the whole woman is in dense tops and lots of makeup to make up for their lack of talent. I actually found Holly fun in his older shows, and I have always admired the busy, but this show is stupid, empty and had nothing to do with it.
