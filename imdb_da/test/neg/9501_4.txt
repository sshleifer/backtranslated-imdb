Underwood's goofy story of a young man (Arquette) convincing his friends to kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, the direction is strange, the dialogues are out of place and distorted, the actors didn't do much justice either, Arquette is annoying all the time, Ian Nicholas was non-existent, Macy was decent but only because he is quite good actor and probably just tried his best not to get out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. This is a silly movie in my eyes, boring at times, not entertaining, just a movie I wouldn't recommend to anyone. IMDb Rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
