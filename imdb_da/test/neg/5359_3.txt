Can anyone give me a reason why only one American door in this movie, and when he does, it must be a very emotional scene, but when the Operation Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians in slow motion scenes or thousands of Arabs, also in slow motion scenes, cheer and say "Take it, you non-American monsters!". I know I used "slow motion action scenes" a lot, but that's because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, slow-motion. Every one of them ... And this group must be called "Invincible Slow-Motion Bullet-Dodging Force" as they seem to have supernatural powers that help them dodge bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have a kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the complete non-American army that stands between them and victory. At this point no one worries because they have been asleep by another ridiculous slow motion scene. That's if they don't laugh aloud at the bad plays, cheesy dialogue and incredibly bad history. That's what I did ... Cast is made by unfamiliar actors who probably remain unknown as they don't even play characters. They just play boys with guns (and let's not forget superpowers) ... The only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not so bad (even if they are in slow motion) for a TV movie ... But that sugar still ... and at the same time it is so bad, it's good ... OK, maybe at the end it will be a little too repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
