I am from Australia and have respectfully seen the extraordinary culture of rugby union in New Zealand. I really appreciate Kiwi's comments in relation to this movie. It was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport. Anyone who was involved in making this horrible movie should be made to apologize formally to anyone who had the accident seeing it. Note: People do not break down and cry while slowly reciting Hakka. What a pitiful scene it was. <br /> <br /> We should feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot, who nearly killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with a half brain, so apparently the light? What a thoroughly eerie character (with visits to children's hospitals does nothing to redeem his despicable personality). <br /> <br /> And why do people even make a movie about Americans playing rugby? They have almost nothing in the sport worldwide, not so much as guaranteeing an attempt to make a movie about it (yes, Rugby is a 'world' sport, unlike gridiron and baseball)?
