Director Jeremiah Checheck, who led us big budget debacles like "The Avengers" and the restoration of "Diabolique" have directed this ripoff of the Die Hard concept done - what looks like - a Blair Witch budget. <br /> <br /> A nuclear reactor in California has been overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - The terrorists are not Arab they are really dissatisfied American soldiers who mask as Arabs! We find that they do not really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. We are not sure what the statement is, but never against. So there really is no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to go alone and actually blow up the plant because he is insane. So maybe there is a threat after all. But the army goes in and all the evil guys are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and a good guy is also killed. Let it be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds muddy and a little waste of time, then you have the idea of ​​what Meltdown is about. <br /> <br /> The script never has trouble introducing the characters or even providing personal information that can unfold or emotionally involve the audience. So we are left with one-dimensional characters: the-expert-it-no-will-listen to; the-trigger-happy-Sergeant; de-slimy politicians; the-dweeby-Engineers. The story jumps from a cliché event to the next in a formula composed of virtually every action movie you've ever seen. But almost every turn, just when we think something can be at stake, skips the script and we find that there is actually nothing to worry about. Like Die Hard, there is a police officer inside, unbenownst to the evil ones. The big twist is that the policeman here is .... A woman! Oh, and she's also hurt. But not so bad, just enough to make her twist a few times. Oh and instead of walkie talkie, which Bruce Willis had this policeman, has a magical cell phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When he does not shout at any other Bruce Greenwood - his jaw made of granite - tries to calm her over the walkie talkie. He even makes a joke once, but we are afraid his face may break. After all, it's serious. <br /> <br /> But most of it is the scene after peoples' questions. The military expert argues to wait it out (his mindset doesn't seem very good, but he must be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people of the White House argue with him; the army sergeant argues with him too; the pleasant Pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist. The dialogue is completely B Movie all the way and lines like "stop the broadcast! STOP BROADCAST !!!" can make you roll from your sofa while wondering if the characters actually refer to this stupidity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps compensating for the lack of quality of production, the camera work is preserved in the faux documentary 21 Gram style, which is to provide immediacy and energy to the scenes, but the way it is rude and amateurishly used here is right annoying; even pretentious. Further attempts to accelerate the pace have been made with inclusion of incoherent black and white recordings that are randomly narrowed to the main action. But it's also pretentious and annoying in the Blair Witch kind of way. In short, the stylistic attempts look very amateurish. <br /> <br /> The music lives up to the visuals - it is synthetic and inexpensive. Kind of like a porn movie, but with less melody and much more heartbeat sounds. The graphical processing is extremely poor too: Cheesy graphics in large red font screaming at us "9:28 pm" as if the timeclock actually makes a kind of difference. <br/> <br /> Meltdown can act as a marketing concept but it is clear that the manuscript was another thought. FX - a part of Fox - put this cheesy production together and lost millions of dollars on it. Now that's what I call a meltdown!
