This is a movie that really makes me scratch. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their very best cartoons - with great animation, unusual backgrounds and great stories. So in the late 40's, a new animation form (for example, "Crusader Rabbit" series on TV) - animated with extremely simplistic art to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture's cynical trick worked !! Instead of the public hating the tones (as they should), many accepted them, and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this movie the award for best animated concise legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately, in the world of Hollywood and Hollywood, it began to creep into products of legitimate studios - resulting in rather crazy cartoons. Later it became even worse as in addition to miserable animation and backgrounds, the stories became almost unbearable for adults to see. The wisdom and style of the classic comics was gone. And for this tragedy I am partly due to GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the granddaddies of cheap comics. The story is not that bad, but the animation is a horror and listening to the child who says "boing-boing" is incessant, is a pain.
