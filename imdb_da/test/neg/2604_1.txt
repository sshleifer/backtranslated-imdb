I must admit that I enjoy the previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at that time. I was sorta enthusiastic about the family reunion until I saw the "new" crap they were putting out. No surprise, it was exactly like the old crap. All the lame jokes were there, including flashbacks, except this time they added a joke about an old scary pedophile that seems to be in every EPISODE. This is just one of the annoying gags family guy living out of and for some reason people are watching. It's no longer fun, it's just annoying. Let it die. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the family guy was fun at some point and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh, but now it's just no fun anymore. If you actually find family guy fun than you should be retarded or borderline retarded.
