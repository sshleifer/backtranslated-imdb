As you can tell from the other comments, this film is only about the WORST movie ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it: Boring, Unbearable, Laughable, Miserable, Stupid, Terrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could go on with such descriptions but you get enough point. <br /> <br /> I would have given this a 0 if possible - bad action, poor conducting, poor production, bad plot. <br /> <br /> This was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965. Very low budget, boring plot, horrible acting, really bad special effects etc ... I rarely ever see a Sci-Fi movie, I Absolutely believe it is so bad. I think this is pure waste. It also has nothing for it. For a "B film", this is the very bottom of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think I would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes. Like this, good low-budget "B" movies give a bad name. That makes the Ed Wood movies good. <br /> <br /> Things to watch movies for direct movies are when you think you've seen the worst, you see something even worse! <br /> DJ Perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh mankind!
