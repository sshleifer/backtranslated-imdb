[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is a totally depressing affair, but unfortunately not the way filmmakers predict. Today, everyone knows the story of how it was slaughtered and released in such a blunt, incoherent form. The other half, in particular, makes little sense, as plate elements are introduced and fall, apparently randomly. The final end left me scraping my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr. Loomis death or what? This is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a movie picture. It's not a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> On a related note, this is the most graphically violent item in the series. I have no problem with gore if it is in the right place, but this movie takes it to absurd levels. The infamous exploding head should be a new cover for the series. Michael himself even enjoys the act of murdering another person, which is incompatible with his effective methodical approach in the John Carpenter original. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who was responsible; CEO Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I would be delighted to give everyone concerned if they would only release the legendary "Producers Cut", a more complete version of the movie, which is a major improvement from every account. From what I understand, it's like a completely different movie. I offer to pay full price to buy the DVD if Miramax comes to its senses and releases it. <br /> <br /> There are, however, a handful of good items. The idea that Michael is being controlled by the Druids is exciting. Paul Rudd is solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a good connection with the original. The slender images help make the case a little more visible. But these bad deals are overshadowed by the overload of drops we have to deal with. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is known to be Donald Pleasance's last movie. Many of his scenes were excluded from the final cut, and when he looks, he seems weak and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, an overt (if accidental insult), if ever there was one. The fact that a talented performer should complete his career like this is too depressing to even think about. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Published by Dimension Films
