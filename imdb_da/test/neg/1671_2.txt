What a really moronic movie, all I can say is that the author must be very fond of magic mushrooms and LSD because this must be the result of one of his 'tours'. You follow the whole movie idea okay it's very strange, but hey I'm sure that at the end will be a perfect good explanation of all this ... Only to be disappointed to find erm no, there is no explanation at all And the twist at the end makes it just as confusing. At the end of the movie you probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a Que who paid for you groceries and the grocer told you it would be 11.95 thanks and continue to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason. There are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and I think it leaves it to the viewer's imagination in a totally bizarre way. Don't make me wrong I like weird movies, 'The Cell' could easily be described as strange and twisted, but in my eyes it is a brilliant movie (despite the fact that J-Lo encountered, I didn't like the maximum itself I didn't succeed in swinging my mind. This is not one of those movies, and I think you should take to consider the characters of those who praise this movie. I can tell you that they are probably the kind of people who would go to an art exhibition, see a splash of pigeon clips on a white table and say "Oooooh, what a masterpiece, the artist has really found a unique way to portray eternity", When in fact all that is, bird is excrement on a table. <br /> <br /> Remember the last in mind when watching this movie, <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading!
