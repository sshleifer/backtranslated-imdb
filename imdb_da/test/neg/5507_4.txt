Jesus Franco is pretty hit or miss on his movie & I would say this was a miss, that is, unless you are in total sleaze. I would say that the man has an eye for a good shot, though it involves topless women with machine guns silhouette towards the sea. This is generally quite ridiculous and the play is terrible, but the play is the least of what it is about. And what is it about? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women choosing and shovel in the hot sun without apparent reason, and just as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe some. Most noteworthy (?) Is a scene involving a young woman tied to a chair and a seemingly amorous German shepherd, and while that is only implied (fortunately), it is probably a scenario I could have done without. I would rate this up with Tender Flesh as one of the French movies I would rather not have in my collection, even if the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
