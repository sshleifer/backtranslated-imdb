This film should be completed as soon as the joke about Bebe's Kids is told in the opening. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really fun routines were not supposed to be the whole family could see. Look to take that point on one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and try to squeeze the joke as long as you can to make it a movie. This movie should be self-service because I can't find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar. What is most fun about this movie is that the authors and producers commit it as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
