If you live in the suburbs, are relatively good financially, and do not have much contact with England's urban life, then this is comedy for you. Nothing a lot of crowd would go to, but if you are like these characters, they show you will love it to pieces. All in all, it is a comedy that the BBC snobs will sit back and laugh at their pleasure and only a few of the public. Comparing it to BBC Comedys as only bad and horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to drift away from the BBC's regular product to the public and deliver to some of a folk culture.
