After World War II attack on US forces in Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (like Muggs), Bobby Jordan (like Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (like Glimpy), David Gorcey (like Peewee), Ernest Morrison ( like Scruno), and Bobby Stone (like Skinny) will serve their country. But both the US Army and the Navy reject them as young. Still wanting to "knock on about a million japs" attacks "boys" an Asian clerk who turns out to be Chinese. However, the unfortunate incident leads the band to help uncover some really ugly Japanese and German people. <br /> <br /> If "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only Mr Jordan and Mr. Stone would be rejected for military service. But it is possible that recruits were turned off by the office manners shown by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. "Let's get tough!" was made under what exactly the script describes as "open season on japs" - for this and other reasons it is not aged well. It's a wasted effort, but the regulars boast, with Tom Brown moving the story together, like Jordan's spy brother. <br /> <br /> *** Let's get tough! (5/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
