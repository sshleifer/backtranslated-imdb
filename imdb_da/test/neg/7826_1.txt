The story is uninhibited and badly written. We get threads and a possible hook on one, only to see it disappear. If the writer had difficulty reading his work carefully, it has turned out that Madsdens character's first problem and encounter with the 'bad' girl suggests there will be an uneasy alliance between them as they try to solve their problem. <br /> <br /> The problem goes nowhere. The relationship goes nowhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. No one digs and no one is appealing. Writing and managing is ridiculous. You can feel that someone is struggling with the mess and changing the story of trying to extract some excitement. There is no. The author / instructor is simply a beginner whose confused action somehow became a movie. From simple mistakes like "... did they take polaroids ..." - in Japan in 2007? For insulting errors like nudity for eroticism, this film is an insult. You can't make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And by patching 'Madsden' on the talent list, manufacturers thought they would succeed. He hardly seems. Asia is certain ... and the result is some heroin-chic panto. <br /> <br /> Give it a big miss.
