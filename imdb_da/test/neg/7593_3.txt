Strange things happen to the Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real daughter) as they move into a large, newly inherited house in Ireland. Crusty bodies are in the basement, a turkey jumps blood, furniture moves and ghosts of a dead child and a tiling old lady up to scare the little girl. Paranormal investigators are eventually called to banish the evil spirits, but Maura is still in possession and shocks everyone along with a meat division. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of clich√©s, but there's a standout performance by Alexandra Paul. .. too bad it does not belong to this movie (nor others I can think of without hand)! She can hardly keep a straight face and her overbearing and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to see. In any case, she is much more interesting to see than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
