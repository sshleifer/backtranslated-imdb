A pretty lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot hangs on a pretty decent idea, writing is deeply paralyzed, and two of the three main teens are absurd wood. The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan, they must be far more ruthless than shown, but if they were the devil-maybe-care, it might be difficult for them to be comfortable, so they end up being neither really. In fact, I only began to enjoy the movie when I started to want their death. One of those films where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realize we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe they wouldn't actually. Avoid.
