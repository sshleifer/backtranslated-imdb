Hercules adventures must be one of the lame excuses for a movie I have yet to drive over. You will have to look far and wide to find something that is approaching the level of ambiguity on the display of this movie. Acting ?? Bath. Editing ?? Bath. Direction ?? Bath. Special effects ?? Poor and Laughable. Reason ?? Bath. Lighting ?? Bath. Cinematography ?? Bath. Costume Design ?? Poor and stupid. Everything else ?? Bath. Seeing Hercules adventures is as much fun as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test. This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno finishers (if any). Eight things I learned to see The Adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you don't have the budget for real special effects, rotoskop a scene from the previous movie. It will look good - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are striving to restore Zeus thunderbolts, take time to frequent stops to vaporize your body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions. <br /> <br /> 3. Any sword fight, use of magic and almost any other daily activity in ancient Greece created a sound that resembles a game of Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed as extraordinary from Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to start your crappyfilm's runtime, expand the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throwing in too much music. It also helps if you have a previous movie to extract scenes from. <br /> <br /> 6. Fighting scenes move much smoother if the evil ones attack Hercules one at a time. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did the money. <br /> <br /> 8. I didn't think it was possible, but Hercules Adventures makes the first film, Hercules (1983), an Academy Award winner.
