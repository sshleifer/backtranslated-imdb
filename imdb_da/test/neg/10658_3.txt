Two redeeming qualities of this film were cinema photography and a story that was hard to resist. But the script, the direction and some scenes were just awful. I kept asking myself why such a good caste would have produced such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity that underlies the film, but knew the movie was full of errors. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much better and reached a bigger audience accordingly. What makes me think about this is that with all the problems in the movie where some scenes were painfully bad to see, I would still see how the obvious conclusion would solve itself.
