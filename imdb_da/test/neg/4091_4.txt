I very much enjoyed Bruce Almighty, but at that moment I found out there should be a sequel without Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (the babblende scene is one of my favorites), and in my opinion, an Emmy deserves for his role in The Office, he is quite weak in this boring comedy. I'm curious how much work the writers write, because we could just as well without the story. But even though we throw the big plot holes (why did elephants and lions help Evan, since the flood only concerned that area in Washington), the movie is simply ... not fun. I didn't even laugh, and as far as I remember, a comedy must make you laugh. Or giggle at least. Not this one. <br /> <br /> However, there is little hope. Evan Almighty has "family" written over it, and perhaps a family show can be fun (kids can be entertained by various animals and the silly jokes), but for me, Evan Almighty simply doesn't cut it. br /> <br /> I give it a 4/10 and hope that Carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature.
