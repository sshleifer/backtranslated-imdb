Another movie with a star of a wrestling. So far I've noticed .... wrestlers can't shop on the movie screen. This movie is no exception. The action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say and they can't be serious, they are trying to act scared, but they fail and look stupid. The action is horrible, possibly from the bad instructor. The plot was stupid .... Only some people are placed in a hotel because they are criminals and they are accidentally killed by. The movie is stupid all the way through, making it the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only think and that's why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Godnat dies. The rod through the head and the stories about him plunging were amazing. All in all, it's a really horrible movie and you should definitely not waste your time with it.
