This grim boring and scary movie made me think that Chaplin was the real Hitler, then only someone like evil that he could torture people with this tripe. I saw this movie remastered, which only made the suffering caused by this cruelty more serious. This film is nothing but a pathetic, repetitive film, which, instead of inducing two hours of laughter, induced two hours of suicidal thoughts. After the first 10 minutes of this, I began to wish that the gas would start to seep from the theater's speakers. <br /> <br /> If I could give it a zero out of ten, I'd happily do it. Avoid at all costs!
