I watched the DVD at a store near my home, and since I'm a cheesy horror movie / alien flicks abuser, I wondered how good it was. It even had two prizes mentioned on the front page (I can't remember which festival it won), so I figured "Hi, it may be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to IMDb to check some reviews. Here, both people based the movie to say that it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful experience in indie film blah, blah. I then played the DVD and did not think of any review I had read with open mind and did not expect anything at all. Man ... I don't like to be this critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I just need to give some pointers of what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1 Action / Dialogue: Action was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes where I couldn't see any effort whatsoever from them! The dialogue was even worst ... I think it was probably the aspect I didn't like most in the whole movie. The speeches between characters seemed ... by. Not just bad, but far away from the actual events in the movie. The monologues of the female character, even though they were delivered, became boring and annoying a little ... But of course, the most ridiculous aspect was ... "foreigners" or "infected" ... I don't even want to comment on one thing just to say that it was completely ridiculous and took the whole mood away from the picture; 2-Visuals: The strongest aspect of the movie ... If you forget the horrible FX and light signals, they used to simulate explosions or whatever the hell they were supposed to be. The "camera in the car" aspect was pretty cold indeed, but they didn't even use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They left it for cheap audio and video FX and the three "infected" characters. The movie gets boring in so many scenes ...; 3 audio: Talk about editing ... this movie has no problem showing how weakly edited it was. From computer sounds, the forest animals mimic "alien dialogue" ... ah ... So what did I like in the movie ... (SPOILERS) the only thing I really liked and it was actually scary was the succession of two scenes where The car is still and you see something / someone goes in the distance. At first I really thought it was me to see things, but when the character realizes that the "characters" coming towards her were her own reflection, I was surprised! Pretty scary idea did well! Other than that ... I had a terrible time. <br /> <br /> And I don't recommend it to anyone ... not even "teenage get together" because you can't even laugh at this ... <br /> <br /> I give it a solid 2. Only some technical achievements worked here ... except it ... yes ... nothing
