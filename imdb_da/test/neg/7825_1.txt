The trailer is so great ... I thought it would be a good movie ... What was supposed to bring the women in Hong Kong to be killed? They could have done it in Paris. And half of the fist: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> -No, I don't! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No, I don't! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No, I don't! Repeat 100 times ... so ... Well, I don't love you ... So I shoot you! : D So here's why filmpiracy is a good thing! Imagine if I would give money for this torture myself! I'm sorry about the time I lost seeing it ... movie producers had to pay me <br /> <br /> for the inconvenience ... worst movie ever seen ...
