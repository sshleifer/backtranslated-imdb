I went to see that I would hate it, I did. Everything about it was wrong; It was as if they were filming another book. Granted the locations and houses very lovely (if not a small miscast-yes even the house was wrong for their parts) Keira was too modern, boring and honestly I found it uncomfortable to see her. Where everyone else sees Darcy as a sex god, so the author of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he is not supposed to be) and the Bennett's turned out to be poor and for some unknown peasants this is incorrect and ridiculous. The soul that Mr Bennett would answer at the door of his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear for the middle of the night is silly. They had servants. Sir. Collins was not repulsive and the greasy just stupid and uncomfortable, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old, and Miss Bingley had a vicious dress, whatever! As if! It is historically inaccurate, and even the end is unsatisfactory. I could go on for days. I hated it so much that it was not just the book, but I fear that for many people it will be their fateful experience of this great novel, and it will give them the worst possible idea. The BBC version is so superior, it's not even fun, and everything about this version is an insult to its memory. In short, if you have to see it, be sure that you have read the book first or seen the BBC version differently, you will be led the confused road that is how it is, which it is not!
