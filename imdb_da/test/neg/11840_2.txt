The storyline of this movie is clich√© and has of course been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide it. It looks like there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur dolls, so instead, the viewer sees some robotic toys (from a cheap toystore) moving in a very unnatural way. It's fun because it's so bad. The action is almost as unnatural as dinos are. No one really seems excited about being in this movie (which I fully understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it is almost impossible to see it without falling asleep. The one positive comment note I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it does not take a full 90 minutes.
