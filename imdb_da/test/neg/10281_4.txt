First Off, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake, has always been. <br /> <br /> This movie came at Movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me and of course the star. But after seeing it I was more confused than I was before it started .... There are some good scenes and I thought they would go somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be a " anti-cop "" anti-buddy "" anti-hippie ", pretty much" anti-everything movie ", with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is great as a leader, as good as anyone could be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and love his acting, even in shit like this ... But this substance induced 70-inch tripe well ... better stay away from this ... And it ends what a piss.
