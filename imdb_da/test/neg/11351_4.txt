Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli's entry into the Mick Garris Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult jewels as the Phantasm series and the irresistible strange Bubba Ho-Tep; But he does not bring any of the qualities that made these movies good for this television episode. The reason is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of ​​an innocent wildfire of a madman. This time it is a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head in crash, she finds herself stalked by a white confronted maniac. The whole hunting sequence is really ridiculous, with the young lady stopping every so often to put traps; only for the madman to appear seconds later, and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband - just happening with a wealth of information on how to avoid crazy kills; with lines like "Expect the Unexpected". The only real highlight for me was the presence of Phantasm's Tall Man, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli tries his best to make as much horror pictures as possible; with things like a rotten body of a dead baby - but because it's so stupid on it all, it's hard to take that piece seriously. This is the first episode in the series and the first one I have seen; I really hope they get better.
