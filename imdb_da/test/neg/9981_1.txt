Who really wants to see it? Genuine violence, disgusting sex, for so long. I don't want to, but I've always been true to my philosophy of seeing movies as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (just after "Next Friday"). It's basically just bad. How can you possibly call it something else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they've been like this." Nice, but why bother us with that? It doesn't matter if it has been like this (and there are many scenes where I really doubt it). The point is, why should anyone see it? The problem is that there is only one reason to like the movie, and it would be that you like violence. There is nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you would say in splatter-slasher movies. But horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement, maybe characters you're interested in. But here's everything dark, boring and boring. Each character is sour. "The story of an emperor who cannot handle his power". What? In the very first scene, he runs naked through the forest with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a maniac for 2 1/2 hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you are lit by seeing Helen Mirren, being pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie. Or castration, yes, it was fun! Real Birth Scenes, How Fun! People, animals, who care about us, let's just treat them as toys. I don't care what anyone says it's no movie, it's just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, degrading and disgusting. Go see a porn movie if you want sex or see a scarecrow if you want violence. At least, they do not make movies as an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
