In order not to be confused with Michael Ritchie's crooked 1975 beauty campaign, this "Smile" is a downward example of the good intentions that pave the way to hell. <br /> <br /> The film parallels two stories: a poor Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a face-deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a TV-burst Malibu family appearing "Gidget Get Birth Control. " Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a pampered, self-absorbed high school distant from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children. <br /> <br /> The movie uses deformity as a means of excitement by treating Ling as the Frankenstein monster. Kramer constantly masks her deformity through hats, caps and camera placement. This approach utilizes the freak show quality of the material. She may be uncomfortable with the way society views her, and Kramer's response is to cover her until the great revelation. Why disturb your audience with such discomfort? We see her face short at the end, and only a few minutes before closing credit shots of her after surgery reveal a swan during the harelip. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; It is crucial that Ling is as popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> Funding for the film came from a trust established by late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They imagined a heritage of quality family film. Give me "Son of Paleface" any day.
