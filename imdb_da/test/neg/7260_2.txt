This movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining the radar, and it is some time before you ever see the deadly mantis. Probably a better movie in the fifties, this dated piece is a bit slow to go and the pay is ultimately not very good. Although it has its moments as when the guy from Perry Mason argues with an old man and when he says "I narrowed the possibilities of a" excuse me, but when you narrow down something, you have a few or more options, not one ... If you get it down to one, you haven't narrowed it down, but you've actually figured out what it is. The monster is the standard 50's sci-fi fair, better than saying the grasshoppers at the beginning of the end. Acting is sub-couple and the hero is the most uninteresting ... in fact, in some shots she looks like a guy in a row. You can see lots of fighter plan stock footage and other things, but you won't see much on all the deadly mantis.
