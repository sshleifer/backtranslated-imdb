Somehow I have lost some years to watch this movie, though it has been quite successful and generated many discussions in Israel. I'm sorry I didn't postpone it indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The theme of 'Kadosh' is a very genuine and painful one for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the Orthodox family and society. The basic situation in the film's premises is possible, the problem is that the way it is brought on the screen and the 'solution' that the described conflicts receive in the movie is wrong. Gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach to picking signs that are either fanatical or incapable of expressing their human feelings makes the whole story seem simplistic. He also doesn't have much better service for his female characters, even though he at least shows more sympathy, and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall, Gitai's vision is one-sided, his cinema is too basic, he focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be of interest to people who do not know them, but are not at all relevant to the whole story. Starting from interesting premises, what we come here is a boring movie that seems longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, obsessive use of music playing in the same register, not only from a musical but also from an emotional perspective and a very inconceivable if not even confusing conclusion. What a difference between this movie and 'Ha Ushpizin' inspired by and describes the same social landscape and managed to transfer human emotions to the screen. In 'Kadosh' there is too little cinema and too little human emotion.
