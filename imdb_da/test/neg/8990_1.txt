This fantasy was complete garbage. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder, critics from the British media complain it is driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is a left-wing looney's greatest fantasy that comes to life on the big screen. Anyone right to the right of such healthy Bush bashers should be appalled that it has ever had the means to be done. I am sure it will work well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It's hard to believe that these days of insane Muslims jumping up innocent commuters, someone in the UK thinks Britain should surrender in the war on terrorism. I think it is no longer the country I admired for standing alone against the Nazis nearly 70 years ago. Everyone hail Neville Chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement!
