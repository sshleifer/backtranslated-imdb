"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the odd behavioral sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it, it goes into Smallville. Jonathan Kent is the first to be performed by it. The flower causes people to turn their behavior, and when it affects Jonathan, he becomes short-haired and violent, but Clark manages to stop him from doing any rash until his father finally goes out. Okay. so far so good. next up is Lana. The episode was good until then, because the flower causes her to try to seduce Clark. at the last minute he refuses her, but the damage has already been done. this episode causes false impressions and is not suitable for people under the age of 20 because of the adult content. The first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect that the flower has on Pete) was good, but in the middle of everything about Lana's alternative personality, was most defiant not, and it destroyed what could have been a brilliant episode. I'll give this episode two.
