This is a really horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this in. The use of miniature models of the train is ridiculous. The reason seems to evolve along the way (there is a stranger aboard; oh, and an eco-terrorist is also on board; oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh, and the train goes into another train one hour ahead, oh, and it took nuclear waste on it ...). I mean, really come! The alien monsters are not scary (though there are many of them), and the play is immense. Check out the guy who plays "next president" - do you really think he could be president? For the sake of goodness, he has spent his entire acting career playing evil guys!
