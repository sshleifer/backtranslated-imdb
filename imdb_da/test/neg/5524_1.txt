As other reviews have said, another of the myriad numbers of Alien clones, this time with a fantastic wodge of The Terminator, adds a bit of the classic SF story "Who Goes There?", And an insane silly plot unit Lifted from the Andromeda tribe (apparently flashing red lights makes raging killer 'droids unable to detect shaken people standing three inches away from them). <br /> <br /> OK story: After a number of people running around in a spaceship and killing each other, we get a caption. <br /> <br /> "25 Years Later". <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station orbiting Mars is due to be relieved of 48 hours, discovering a ginormal spaceship on a collision course. It's Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. Not a good time to have taken everything useful off-line at the relay station to do some repairs then. The nearby ship does not depart from its course and sends a "NOT under any circumstances submit this ship!" warning. After a lot of shouting at each other, the crew of the relay station do something together and get the station out of the way right in time. But the ship changes course and hits them in some way - impaling one of the crew on a pointed, clever crew member. The satellite is beginning to "lose integrity". Bits de-pressurize. Much more shouts and runs where only two crew members are sucked into space behind. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked out behind?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, the wheelchair-bound techy (called "Wheeler" - the only detectable joke in the whole movie) is derived from the fact that Siberia drains them from all their power and they must board on her and turn off her engines. They all go aboard and take off their helmets. "DO NOT enter this ship!" Of course, getting on board the ship and exposing yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases. A team leads to the Main Computer room, where they find a frozen-frozen guy that collides with what looks like an American Express card, but turns out to be a mini-disc. The other team finds some switches. It is astonishing that the dead block turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member most likely to survive a meeting with a raging stranger. They turn off the engine, but that means the ship's reactor will explode. An eerie Point of View Shot starts killing people. There is some guess that Siberia has discovered a new ore, a worthy source of millions of values, which means that the more friendly members of the crew immediately put themselves in danger of getting it. The POV shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! walking sounds on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, they give you the idea that the killer has tights and the effect is wasted. After that, just run around and be killed in the order of cruelty and acting until only the obvious survivors survive - along with the sweet dog who had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths. Just why hardened veterans walk into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets. Cats and dogs have long been a mystery to this kind of movie. Other stupid highlights include anyone who forgets to list the descending levels of oxygen until reminded of the built-in computer's voice (not that the low oxygen levels in any way dampen any of the impressive fires that this foolish boot starts). If the Killer Droid id is so clever, it can steer the ship in a tight curve and get someone else to hit the relay station, why not turn it off "DO NOT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES Enter this ship!" warning signal .. I'm sure it was looking for more people to kill and then shouting away! was not a good way to go about it. <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only one to play - everybody just flares their nostrils all the time as they tease their teeth and shout and point guns at each other. That kind of script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that kept me looking to the end was the hope that the script requires her to take off all her clothes or get wet while not carrying much. Unfortunately, it didn't. One of the things that is wrong with this movie (except having more cyan on the screen than in any other movie ever) is that there was no free naked.
