I'm sure I saw the future KILL for the same reason as most people: the amazing poster of HR Giger. And like everyone else, I was disappointed to find out that the movie couldn't live up to the poster (Giger said director Moore actually asked him to do so). When I first saw this when I was 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I still think that if I hadn't seen specific movies on MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> The reason has a bunch of annoying college boys running into the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang leader for their brotherhood. It is when they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psycho who kills the gangster and blames it on the frets as an excuse to chase them and take power. The rest of the movie mostly consists of chases. A hand full of frat trying to fight their way out of the mutant city (which I think should be LA, even though it was made in Texas). There are some pseudo-political things that the frat boys community is pro-nuclear, and the mutant society is anti-nuke. This is how Splatter became a freak because of radiation. Most people develop cancer from radiation, but splatter just shoots spikes and slaughter girls. Yes, it gives lots of meaning. At one point, our heroes rescued a mutant girl from two pro-nuke police and she shows them "how the other half lives." The other half turns out to be all punk children who dance to a bad 80-year-old pop band. So our little epic is both stupid and dated. It's really all there is to it. Frat boys run around in shaken buildings, while guys who look like motorcyclists try to kill them ... Oh, and that's the future. I don't think you will have any doubts as to why Ron W. Moore never made another movie. This thing is a real stinker. If you like Giger, buy his books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie), or just watch ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time that no one needs. <br /> <br /> If this description does the picture well, there is another crappy movie that does the same, only bigger and better: After New York's fall. It is bad, but it blows FUTURE killings of the screen.
