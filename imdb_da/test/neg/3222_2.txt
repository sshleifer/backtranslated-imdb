A great gangster flick, with brilliant performances by famous actors with amazing action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> Seeing such a broad draft of well-known actors who have many good films in their film films in such a movie is pretty amazing, without a doubt it could be one of the worst things they could possibly come up with in. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the plot is as you would expect from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy. The way it is told, the movie looks far beyond what it is (when I thought the two hours should be almost over, I was totally surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). The action scenes look very much like those from the 80s television series - for example, the A-Team. It was just what in the 80s (especially with the A-team) these scenes were far more sophisticated than those in "El Padrino". It is especially fun watching the boys point to their weapons in the air and still hit something (not talking about people taking tires behind car doors, which later look as though they have been shot through). <br /> <br /> Acts well for the action. Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it is so exaggerated that you might think it is a parody (but unfortunately it is not). My advice is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
