1. Looked at 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): Mildly entertaining story of a group of five children forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother are fighting and working in World War I as England entered the war. They are told that they should not go to the uncle's mansion, which of course they do again and again, and they discover a sandfeet they want daily that only lasts until the sun goes down. This is the "IT" referred to in the title created by the Jim Henson Group and spoken by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their desires usually cause other problems they have to learn from. This part of the movie has not been performed very well because it is obvious that the children, above all the Freddie Highmore character, do not learn from them, but instead continue to go back to "it" to solve their next big problem . "IT" is not as fun as it could have been with comedian Eddie Izzard, who really didn't get much opportunity to improvise, and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, even though he's the best character. The kids are fine about their plays, but the story would probably have been much better to go into the fantasy area, but they also had a human story that could also tell, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. So all in all, this was an OK movie but could have been much better.
