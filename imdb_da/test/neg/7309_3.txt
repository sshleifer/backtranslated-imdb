The figure of Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is mostly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy of Ernst Marischka (1950s), where beauty, gentleness, sweetness but also history are present. This was Sissi, perhaps myth for some; however, a strong portrayal. The spirit of the Habsburgs' greatness and the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness greatly influenced the films. They simply had a soul. However, Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, although made 50 years later, seems to be a wrong exhibition of the Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something else to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; but it does not seem to add much, but deprives the whole story of much. Let me analyze it in more detail. September 1898, Sissi starts in Geneva port. Accompanied by her girlfriend, she goes to dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), to tell the whole life story to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists of flashbacks to important moments in Sissi's life, but these moments are chaotically presented, and therefore, one who is not very knowledgeable about Austrian history can become completely misled or confused. Emphasis is placed on Sissi's bad marriage to Emperor Franz Josef. Her wedding night scene is a failure. No one treated an Empress like that (I mean dressing and paying). The focus on Sissi being misunderstood is quite historic, but the points that her vision differs from the rest of the hips are not true. Where is her desire for peace? Where is her love for her nation? Where's her charity? Sissi seems to be pretty very elegant, modern, liberal (from the 21st century point of view). She primarily cares for her appearance, which is not true historically. Sissi had an inner life that is not shown in the film. "When women want to wear pants" is a phrase said by her and seems to be the image of Sissi presented in the film. Sissi rejects monarchy, which is the film's noticeable criticism of Austrian empire. In addition, she partially accepts anarchist movements, and to my very surprise, she blames her husband, Emperor Franz Josef, for Rudolph's son's death. Where is there any mention in the story that Sissi was present in Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, mother-in-law, is better shown, but Sophie's death hardly seems authentic and the conversation a bit clich√©. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize so much, but another important aspect of movies that I find weak here are performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments like Sissi, she generally doesn't fit the role. She looks more like a "femme fa speech" than a tragic emperor. Her makeup is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures like the Empress. Malik Zidi is a little better than Rudolph and can be considered the one who raises the value of the performance, in general. Still, Stephane Audran has no special job as Sophie: you simply don't get the impression why she detests Sissi. She despised her for Sissi's young age while it was crowned for her behavior, lifestyle and her faith. First, it is seen in the movie, but that is not enough. But the biggest mistake is, I think, Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was counting with pride, honor, patriotism ... here he seems to be a kind of libertine thought to only love his queen. And the depiction is so weak that this performance is very pale. The exact choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt, she really fits the role of her appearance and her gesture. But unfortunately her role does not require much time on the screen. A good point in this movie is some costumes and beautiful authentic places. Geneva's port is well presented, and the moment of Sissi's death arises as a good surprise from the movie. It seems to be how it really was; However, the moment is well from the symbolic perspective ... the Empress goes and knows nothing about this is her last moment. That is how she must have felt about it, it is that a madman destroyed part of the world's greatness. Another good moment was visually when Sissi spoke to his son Rudolph in Corfu. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In sum, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very prominent historical figure, a significant historical time, it tries to cure the sweetness of the Sissi trilogy, but does not seem to offer anything creative. Charm is gone, greatness is gone and history is ignored! Not much worth finding out! 3.10
