This is the slowest "movie noir" movie I've ever seen. Very weak script only allows Jack Palance and Rod Steiger to deliver exceptionally good lines that were made for a working audition. Palance and Steiger both confirm that they are really serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, which mainly takes place in a living room. Of course, the director moved the actors around in a rhythmic circle as they delivered exhausting long lines to keep the slow pace from becoming visible to the public. The action does not cease for the last ten minutes of the movie. If you are one looking for more depth in a criminal drama, this is not for you!
