Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal movie I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, even in progress, and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed about a little. The best action scenes were Nia when she again kicked ass. It was interesting to see her as the bad guy after seeing her in two seasons at Walker, Texas Ranger, and still kicking, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
