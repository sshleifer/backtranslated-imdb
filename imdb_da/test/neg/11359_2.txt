This movie is really bad and trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends in removing credibility from the film's history. There are so many things I could point to the movie that I could almost write a book about how much the movie sucks. For example, like 50 people on the plane, they killed as 100, and they continued to come, apparently the virus causes hepatic complications because everyone had yellow eyes, and the virus causes people to roar like lions or something and the virus does not regenerate Only tissue, as it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus destroys people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot a person with a gun (probably only on airplanes), the person is kicked back into the air. Remember that if you escort a prisoner on an aircraft and you lose him, always look in the drawers and cupboards the size of a bottle you never know where these bastards should hide. And if you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (happening all the time) after seeing dozens of people killed, just get off the plane, watch the sunrise and joke about dancing the flight attendant. :)
