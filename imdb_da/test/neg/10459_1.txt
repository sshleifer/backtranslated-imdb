As other posters have commented, it was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid-friendly) FX was low class, they should have spent $ 1 on a coke. As is typical of these D movies, most victims die and leave a mystery except a fortunate soul and of course the lead. Hope the money was worth for Boxleitner, really really big step down from Babylon 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but damn it was low, even for him. "It was so bad, and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad too. Don't look. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning spoiler under **** <br /> <br /> This thing chased everyone, it was after and yet Boxlietner was gone ... that was pure BS. And the end? How the hell did the kids just end up with him?
