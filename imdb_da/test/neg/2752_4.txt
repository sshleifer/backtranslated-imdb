Shemp finds out he is in charge of inheriting one million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Considering how scary he looks and his personality, it's not surprising that he can't get a taker - that is, until an article appears on the paper explaining his difficulties their new hubby (plus the money of course). <br /> <br /> While I didn't hate the three stooges and would like to see their shorts at times, they never even got on their best day close to Buster Keaton's brilliant comedy. That's why I didn't like this movie, as it was a ripoff of the plot from Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With Stooges it was not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy pictures or just reuse older Stooge shorts. So from the beginning, this movie is a pale imitation of an original. It is also obvious that this movie lacks the charm and subtlety of the original, and the gags generally seem to be very forced (especially the phone's booth scene). The cousin Basil bit, however, was pretty sweet and fun - though it was far from subtle! But the worst aspect of the film was the not very funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women seemed to marry him, and the action became very quick and furious - all in a small room and lacking in comic beats - ending in a fizzle. <br /> <br /> Overall, a boring retread. Also, before you mark this review "not helpful", make sure FIRST see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
