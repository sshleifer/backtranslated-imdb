I rented this movie in the hope that it would provide good entertainment and some good poker knowledge or stories. What I got was a documentary type look at an average guys life that happened to be really good on cards. Do I want to see the romance with his wife? NO Do I want to see if everything was happening in this guy's life except poker? NONE. Well that's what you get with this movie. The play is good for such a low budget piece of crap. The film never tries to break the mold or make anything original. It simply sleeps going its way through the script. The ending is disappointing and doesn't really look deep into Ungar's mind. Instead, it focuses on what was already obvious. He was a killed card player with an average life that does not differ from any other average Joe in Vegas. The film focuses on aspects of its life, which were the UN's extraordinary rather than the extraordinary. The poker scene in the whole movie gives up to approx. 4 minutes of recordings. Ungar's results in winning the WSOP 3 times seem to be life-based. A 10-year-old could do a better job of managing this movie. Or maybe the script was a piece of shit from the beginning that condemned this joke of a movie. <br /> <br /> To watch a movie about gambling watch Rounders. It has at least style.
