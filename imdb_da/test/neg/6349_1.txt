Last night I was bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out cold' that I once bought with a lot of other cheap movies from a video store. Seemed like a good old action movie, so I took out chips and cola and was ready for a relaxing evening. Now the pain started right from the beginning. The protagonist is a boxer who is the best guy I've ever seen. Of course, as the good person, he must be nice, but he is just a pussy! It doesn't quite fit with a boxer who has 28 KOs and starts working for a pimp to make some extra money. Even fine guys can still be cool. Well, his first fight came as he worked for this pimp. Each stroke was clearly missed and it became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the punches. Then there is this totally worthless play of the whole cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave it a 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie.
