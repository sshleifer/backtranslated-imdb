I rarely laughed so hard at a movie. Note that I laughed at the Iron Eagle, not with it, because that's probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception for sci-fi monstrosity CyberTracker). You must also remember that this movie is not a comedy! Even with a view of the prehistoric plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could enter an American Air Force Base, steal an F-16, fly to the Middle East and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing is without faith), the movie is full of ridiculous action scenes that give little or no meaning. For example, Doug Masters at various points uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot a steel beam, a control tower and a tent. All these things explode into a massive fireball. Why? The enemy aircraft also explodes in a strange way, reminiscent of a paper plane blowing up with a fireworks display. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I actually enjoyed this movie. Certainly not in the way that decision-makers would probably have enjoyed, but I did the same and later bought the DVD. It is also enhanced by David Suchet's amazing presence as the evil terrorist leader (perhaps you will remember him as a mustachioed Belgian detective Poirot?) Overall, the movie is a laugh and a light-hearted alternative to more serious fighter films like Top Gun. Though it is just as subtly homo-erotic (check out the male line between Doug and Chappy. Something happens between them!)
