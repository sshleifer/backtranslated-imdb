This is the second addition to Frank Baum's personal produced trilogy of Oz films. It is almost the same childhood as in the other two pictures, although I consider it better for the others because it is shorter. As in the other films, there are artists in animal suits, an adult woman pretending to be a boy, and the characters and plot jumping everywhere while the camera is static. This time in the middle is a magic cloak that gives wishes, and the boy is played by a woman is made a king. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects are seen at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure exposures. And there is a man in the moon similar to those made by Georges Méliès the year before, most famous in 'Le Voyage dans la lune' (1902). Méliès imaginative fantasies and creative tricks made him the premier pioneer of early cinema, and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this little Oz series.
