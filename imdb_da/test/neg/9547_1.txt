I can imagine the authors of this story thinking about this script: <br /> 1. It makes a serial killer movie like the Se7, Knight Moves, Copycat and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It will sell ... 2. The killer must adopt some kind of pattern. I know; He will copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. It hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3. Now we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; Of course, the good guy can be bedding just like in the rear window. 4. At last, we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. <br /> <br /> Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and run them completely in the ground. I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High. I just kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the twist ended finally, I was not shocked, I just said, "Oh. Who cares?" The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just a proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally it would earn at least 2 or 3, but I'm so sick for unoriginality. When will they learn? 1.10
