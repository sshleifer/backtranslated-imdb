I loved the beautiful Greek landscape, but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even more difficult to follow in the movie. I can't imagine how anyone can watch the movie, get some grip on it, if they haven't read the book, and they will probably wonder why Australian Allison became French Anne and many others seemingly meaningless changes in history. The mysteries in the book seemed to be carved or laid out in the film. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it when I had read the book several times. I have recently seen it with my grandson (very intelligent at 8pm and usually in movies I like), which was mostly amazed at how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise couldn't imagine why one would see it except nature.
