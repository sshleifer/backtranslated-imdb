This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and I still haven't recovered from his 1990-Oscar nominations. And as well as Hulkster shines in this movie, you can't discount the fantastic writing and direction that selects this masterpiece in the highest part of movie performance. If you haven't seen this movie, drop what you do right now and get yourself a copy. I guarantee it will blow in mind. And if you don't like it then I just have a question for you .... Watcha will do when the 24 inch pythons and Hulkamania run wild on you !!!!
