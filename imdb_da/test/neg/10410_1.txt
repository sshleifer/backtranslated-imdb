Are you kidding me? The music was so loud in this show that I often couldn't even hear the dialogue. And the music was nothing great. Someone knows what Jakes mother said when he walked into the door ??? And the sponge cloud looked pretty close to having so little instant destruction. Someone examines the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this. I felt like a bunch of his com players were sent on the spot and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialogue. And what about a Kansas teenager about shopping in Soho .... couldn't we have had a better line here? Bored me to tears and only kept the watch out of the soft leaves of the over-mixed way to loud music.
