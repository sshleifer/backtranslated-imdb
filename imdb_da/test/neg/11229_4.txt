If you're in the mood to laugh at a really bad movie (bad in the way only Ken Russell can be at his worst), try this one. It'll make you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn booth and you can just smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner walks around in a blonde gem and gets her kick from "pretending" to be a two-bit hooker (she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has become so damaged by men that this is the only way she can connect), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is out to murder her (another movie ending with Tony Perkins in a row). Annie Potts turns out and must not give an ounce of her usual humor, which is reason enough to hate this movie. Kinky will love the sex scenes, so rent the unrated version in the red box so you can watch Turner give a policeman a taste of his billy club (I had to pause the video until we stopped laughing).
