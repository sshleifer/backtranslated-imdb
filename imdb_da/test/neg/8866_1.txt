I never understood this type of ghost film. You get some serious / semi-serious movies that everyone knows and takes the seriousness out of it through immature speed jokes and such. We've seen it many, many times, and it's never been fun. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more unclear and less liked the genre, although I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as clearly understood by the title, focuses on making childish fun with Pulp Fiction. That's the main reason I decided to see it when I found that the movie was overly indulgent by Tarantino's sick mind and greatly overstated. I had hoped for one or two good jokes that were fun of the overly violent and meaningless type of film that Pulp Fiction was in every aspect, in my (anything but humble) opinion. I was very disappointed. The reason is basically a rip-off of Tarantino's movie, with a few scenes spoofing others, often better, movies, in the same childish and humorless way. Pacing is bad, and often you sit there, guessing the outcome of each scene, predicting any joke, often thinking of a better one on the spot, bored out of your mind. The action is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and are deliberately paper-thin to make fun of the characters they are based on. The problem is, it doesn't work. It just makes the movie much harder to sit through. Humor is young and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like. The movie is a terrible waste of the real real actors involved. Possibly a little entertaining for fans of the typical spoofing films of the same kind. I only recommend this to people who have really cut off Pulp Fiction, or fans of the Zucker parody films. Everyone else: avoid. 1.10
