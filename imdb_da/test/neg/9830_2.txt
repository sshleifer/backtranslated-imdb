If you've ever wanted to know more about taxi drivers, then it's a great movie to watch, just for information. I can only hear it now, "Wait, just wait a second! Why don't we follow a driver's seat throughout the day! Cabbies are fun, and they are the people they meet and they only talk to each other for just a few minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! Harry, you take care of production, Joan, you have materials, Brian, you go around some actors, and we must all meet here again tomorrow to start filming! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the movie could not have been worse if it was much happening. At least without planning at all, there is always the surprise element. Some of Jim Carry's films have added stuff when they go together and they always do well at the cashier's office. The problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well scripted out, and it tastes pretty much. Paul Dillon plays the cab driver in Chicago who works all day. We pretty much see what he sees. People come in and out of their car and he drives around town. He speaks to these people for a few seconds, and then we get more people. <br /> <br /> I admit there were a few funny bits here and there. A religious family tries to talk to the driver's lead into the church with them, he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a bad girlfriend from her boyfriend, and takes a rape victim home. I think the moral of the movie is that a cabin driver is more than a cabin driver and has a greater influence on the lives of his passengers than you might have imagined. For some people, he is just a means of getting out of here, but for others his very common word helps change the direction of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to trying to make sense of the rest of the movie and it does little to succeed. It had a bit of the anesthetic that feels to it where the vast majority of the movie sucks and then eventually tries to do better in just one or two changes. I was not so impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few worth seeing again. As far as the actors go, Paul Dillon is. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all in this, for about 30 seconds each, but don't look at this for any of them or you will definitely be disappointed. I want to give the other people the impression that it is not your ordinary movie they have produced here, but it was not a very good one either. There just wasn't enough material to hold you for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it did not succeed.
