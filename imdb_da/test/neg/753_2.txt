Poor Jane Austen should be glad she is not out to see this horrible wreck of an adaptation. So many good Jane Austen movies have come out recently that it deserves to be permanently buried with two other films, I despise-The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main beef with the movie is that it totally misses the book's point. Jane Austen was joking at the Gothic craze in his community, and much of the novel is heavy in the cheek. The film, however, is serious and faces terribly melodramatic. The light-hearted, fun-loving taste of Austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this eerie foray. Iinto horror meets with drama day. The scenarios about Catherine's imagination are both free and uninteresting. Also Henry Tilney is terribly unappealing. Why do I ask anyone would fall for him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen tonight, see Emma instead!
