This movie was bad and the films about how some college students stay in a house to get money by renovating it, and then find out that the house has a woman Deamon in it and that there is a portal to hell. In this movie there are lots of stupid scenes as at the beginning of the movie, how they clean the house and they start dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good acting scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped off. I've only hired this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and the only thing worth seeing if you're a fan of horror movies.The acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is Roy Scheider from the great movie Jaws and throughout this movie there are lots of errors and my rating is 4 out of 10.
