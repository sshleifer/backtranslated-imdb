First of all, this movie is gross in terms of nausea, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to see it because it looked like it could be fun, but it quickly became disturbing with the ice made of body parts and surprising graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg, who testifies to the cruel murder of a man's husband (Greg subsequently becomes crazy and grows up to be the title character) of what seems to be mobassins. There is no explanation for this murder, making it the biggest WTF moment in the whole movie. Other, lesser WTF moments include the surreal asylum that Greg goes to (with evil clowns), a woman who speaks in tongues because she has been obsessed with the Holy Spirit (what this has to do with something I do not know) and that the fact that Olivia "Holy crap has her career thought so badly" Hussey is in it. None of these are good enough reasons to see it. The only reason is the character Tuna, who is a thin child with cushions filled under his shirt, so he resembles a fat child. For some reason it hit me as fun. I went much further up in the night than I should have looked at this movie to find out if there was some reason why they couldn't use a real fat child for the role. Although I fell asleep before the end, I have gathered from other reviews that tuna end up losing "weight". Okay, so they didn't have the budget to pull this out realistically. Suggestions to the instructor: What about doing the sign ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> That's it; If the prospect of tuna does not interest you enough, there is no other reason to acknowledge the existence of the movie. If disgusting horror movies about ice are your favorite source of entertainment, check out the far better "The Stuff" instead.
