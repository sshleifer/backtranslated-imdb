I watched this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it was so cool. The DVD saw so many great actors, and I wondered, "Why have I never heard of this movie?" Then I turned to the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and the answer began to explain itself. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to defeat the idea that a great cast is like a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so horrible. Okay, the script is terrible and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I have ever seen in Chazz Palminteri and I am surprised that he would do something, this ridiculous. But undervalued, but skilled actors must make their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional police specialist who comes out as stupid as a C-movie mob handbook. He, along with the leading detective (the badly directed Nolte), the great but simple Michael Madsen and the late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen is completely wasted) constitute an elite group of LA detectives charged with liberating the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s. The film introduces this squad as police, who will break any law to ensure those who believe they are above the law do not operate in their city. At the start of the film, the police smoke at a local restaurant, take an alleged mobster (William Peterson) and take him to a place they call Mulholland Falls. They throw him out of one of the rocks on Mullholland Drive, and it must show how serious these guys are tearing the city crime. No matter what. This was no more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title designed to make you think of LA and its famous sites. Somewhere later they find Jennifer Connelly's body of death and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> In the direction that was nothing short of amateur and weak! Apart from the fact that the characters were B-movie quality, the overactive of those like Treat Williams, the guy who plays the chief and the terrible Daniel Baldwin, are just a few highlights that made this movie appear to be Lee Tamhoris first movie. There is not a good performance in the movie except perhaps Melanie Griffith, who some might argue for, was the worst in the movie (she won a raid for this movie). Eventually it was her character, it wasn't that big, and she really didn't have much to work with. <br /> <br /> As with any bad movie, it all begins with the writing, and this script was no gem. Plot is formulated simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into account the motivation of characters. The way the characters appeared was incredible. Cops take the law in their own hands, are credible under the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case, it seemed as if these guys could get away with something, including murder, and never mind an eye to clean up anything. I assume that we as the audience just have to assume that nobody saw anything and that people would not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable, and the vagina is fed so well that we understand everything that will happen for a while before the signs do. But it does not make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is, even though there are no heroes in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the best component of the movie was the great score of David Grusin. From the beginning, it relied on one side of CHINATOWN, which quickly faded when I realized how incredible almost everything in the movie was. It did not surprise me to hear that it made a huge eleven million in the box office. What I want to say is that this movie is worth watching for a few laughs. Nick Nolte's play is like a failed domesticated junkyard dog, and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also almost fell on the floor of each of the slow motion shots used in the movie (I think there are three with one under one key fight scene). When you need slow motion in the heat for a dramatic moment, you obviously have some problems. So even with my negative criticism, I would recommend this movie solely for the purpose of luring laughter, that is, if you appreciate the good films like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
