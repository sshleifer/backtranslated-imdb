This movie was horrible, and in the end I was wondering why someone was in the trouble of doing it. Now it was not too bad I studied movies, and this film was composed very nicely and had very good cinematic everything with interesting angles for very nice lighting and excellent camera work. I wish I could have seen it back in school because it would have made a good movie to write a paper about. BUT ........ When I graduated and lost most of my movie prose, I realized that a movie should be entertaining above all, this movie was long and boring, and I'm not sure when it finally pointed out that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
