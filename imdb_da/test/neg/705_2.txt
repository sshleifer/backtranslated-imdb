Let me first say that I am a Laurel and Hardy buff. I've read every book printed about them and have seen all their available movies more than once. I even took a chance and called Stan on the phone. He was very friendly and talked to me for over ten minutes. I followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back. I still have that letter. <br /> <br /> This movie has some nice comedy moments, but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual form. Stan was seriously ill during production and looked worse than he did ten years later. In my opinion, any Laurel and Hardy movie is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate perception of this movie comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To quote him, "This movie should never have been made."
