A true Gothic Horror Trash Classic! <br /> <br /> Uhm, it's actually a horrible movie. The best thing about it: Rosalba Neri is built naked nipples. Intensive suction material. <br /> <br /> Oh, Rosalba Neri is a nice lady. Never even heard of her before this flick, but she is an amazingly nice looking lady. But honestly, it was her nipples that did it for me, in the very first scene before the movie abruptly ended, all naked and traveling ... In all, dream stick, man. Okay, excuse you get a little away here ... Essentially I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a bleak and horrible flick with a big stupid, ugly-looking Frankenstein monster and a pair of naked breasts. And it has a castle in it. So I wasn't really disappointed or anything. It dragged too much in some places (the first resurrection of the being continued for years, with father Frankenstein experimenting only, talking and trying more). There was a fun, imbecile tribute to the original Frankenstein, though: Instead of throwing a little girl into a lake, Mongoloid Franky picked up a naked chicken and threw her in a river. Had me laugh. <br /> <br /> Some friends of mine just did a little bit too much about this flick, though. Maybe I was expecting a little too much. But Rosalba's set nipples were well worth it ... (Aw shit, I really must stop mentioning her nipples). I think I'll just finish this user comment now.
