Two popular actors are paired in showtime as De Niro and Murphy play a policeman and an actor. Although they share the most screen time together, when they do not have their expected performances, such films as Analyze this, meet parents, Dr. Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The movie starts interesting but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy, which is quite disappointing. It feels like De Niro doesn't enjoy being in Showtime. It's a shame because he really shows his feelings, that's what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used wisely, this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed by a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think there will be a sequel to this, at least casting De Niro and Murpy again. ** out of *****
