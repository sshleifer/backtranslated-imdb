This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, it was terribly made it didn't flow it was very choppy because many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I got an idea of ​​what happened, OK, so it was a kid who stole some cars, and while running from the police, he gives it to someone cause the police beat him and he is facing his parents who sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, he meets a girl who loves to climb up and he enters the sport and has to ask his uncle to let him come into a competition to climb, and yes it is about It's like I said horrible movie.
