The movie starts promisingly, the use of imagery and simple short clips transfers the larger story, which would normally need a significantly higher budget than this one. But it started to worry me as it continued, combined with another exaggerated husky Max Payne type of voice over the movie began to look not so good. I was hoping it was just the introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really caught me and took me into this movie. The idea that a researcher has created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from another infection was an interesting scientific idea. So the people who had the most bizarre ailments sought the researcher and offered to be his human experiments, made me believe it could be a very good little movie. But the introduction had not gone well. <br /> <br /> There was apparently a change in pace as the film turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters of the movie, the subjects. Although the play was not amazing, there seemed to be a lot of room for character development throughout the film, and the footage was done quite well with a varied mix of characters. But these faded through the movie. They were not used again after a few short clips, and I felt there was a missed opportunity to give a great character development by reflecting back on them, but it was not to be. <br /> <br /> imaging is increasingly interrupted from history, which often repeats itself to represent something still happening. This interruption and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting comment. It began to recite words one after the other. Short pointless sentences and no one recites relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. If there was something to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looping ... you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Now it could have been to reflect the confusion and character, slowly getting caught in its own minds, wandering due to lack of food and water. What it really did was to completely turn off my voice, and at the end of the movie I found that I hadn't listened to any of the rattles. <br /> <br /> A number of times an event arises the camera shows all the characters in sequence for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thought-provoking. There are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene, for example, a sign sleeps to black, then falls back onto the character sleeping again. Look, we know that the sign is asleep, we know that time has passed, so continue. All in all, there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long hanging shots to fill the time. The action was not bad and the characters were okay but not exploited and developed. When they interacted, there were some really cringeworthy moments. For example, when one of them asks if they are hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to a group shot, they pause, look at each other, return to the camera and say slowly "No". It raised a snail or two. Their dialogue was slow and glossy and either completely or completely unnecessary. There seemed to be no space where the dialogue hit. <br /> <br /> But there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find unless you considered them in isolation and it looks like it has almost happened to this movie. The film has been considered a series of scenes and not as a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this seen more than in the main story. The signs are infected with the virus that has killed the animals, the one that was designed for them. We are told that it is developing in stages to something dramatic, and that is what we expect. What we get are the signs that eat loads together, all throw together, water leaps from their mouths into convincing streams, then they all fall asleep. These are the phases that everyone does really early in the movie. Then they all say "Good" together when asked how they are, and that is it. It is the virus that does nothing else. <br /> <br /> So much more could have been done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus, and it protects them from any kind of damage. It could have explored a serious change of these characters as it infected and took over, it could have developed these characters, showed them to make decisions, and do things that link their character to appear in flashbacks for interviews. <br /> <The end is not even confusing, exciting or thought-provoking. It just shows something that is happening and that is it, even though it has long been pulled out with the annoying voice over it. I really struggled with this movie and watched a number of press releases go out (including a famous TV critic who left within the first twenty minutes) I remained but regretted the lost time.
