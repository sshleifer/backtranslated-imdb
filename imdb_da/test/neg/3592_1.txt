Ok, I want to make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie. Everyone knows about the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. In connection with this film, I believe that MPA must create a new classification standard: IQ-20.
