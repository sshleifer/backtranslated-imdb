This must be the greatest practical joke ever. I'm surprised that all the other actors held a pretty face. I may be wrong, but the impression I get from this movie was that they cut Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez to appear in this movie that has a budget of just under $ 40, depending on how much these bat flakes and The spray meter's equipment costs, creates the most incoherent movie ever created, and leans back and laugh at Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone not in joke. <br /> <br /> If they didn't scare them with a chance and they legitimately tried to make a real movie, I feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation. I've had a loving affair with cheesy movies, but this movie is so bad I can hardly see it. They repeat meaningless "special effects" so many times that it is obvious that they were just trying to cover the fact that they shot only 30 minutes of recordings. If I was forced to watch this movie on repetition, I would blow my self unconscious with my own hands after approx. a half time through. No offense to the great Frank Stallone, but I'd rather see Sylvester learn a fingerpainting class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again.
