Unfortunately, this film lives up to approx. 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans, there is nothing more disappointing than a movie that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well below the mark. The Far Cry video game released in 2004 created such a cult after making a movie from the content, should have been easy and many players would have flocked to watch the movie. If you are a gamer who has played Far Cry; Don't watch this movie. Anyone who has not played the game; It will still act as a B grade acted / B grade directed movie. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame ... this should have been easy to make into a blockbuster. The game's story was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you still managed to take it and shape it into your own horrible recreation of an instant classic. Video game companies are warned - if Uwe Boll comes a knockin ', lock the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I'm looking forward to seeing you doing in yourself in Inglourious Basterds. What did you think of taking this on? Sigh.
