Unfortunately, I think it's one of those movies that if you or I took it to the studio and said, "Can I make this amazing movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?" the study would have kicked to death on the spot. But if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, "I want a hunt for Italy with my friends, what about it?" the studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We kick off with the casino manager from Ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who fired off his money and saw Brad Pitt shagging Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there is some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such And so and so it ends somehow. <br /> <br /> The film, however, includes the most shameful moment for both Julia Roberts 'and Bruce Willis' career, a cinematic gem. I almost threw my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis is clear and wondering when he can leave and how much the check should be. <br /> <br /> Oh, to be fair, I would have made it for money so I suppose I can 'I really criticize the poor love, but I'm a penniless slob, not a Hollywood legend . I guess what's really annoying me about this movie isn't that it's boring and meaningless and has a horrible story, but I think the actors probably had fun doing it! I think the actor all over the job is projecting emotions outward ... I want to pay to go to the party, but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> See if you like Como or fancy CZJ or something, but otherwise go for a walk.
