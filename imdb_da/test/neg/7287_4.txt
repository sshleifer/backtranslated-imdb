I find myself getting smaller and less excited about Disney's successors to movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct to video movies is not the same, but these movies don't even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen the previews for Stitch-The Movie, you will see my point. But I go down, this movie confirms my point. The animation is sloppy, the lines of history resemble Saturday morning cartoons, and not all of the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. It was so obvious that the person who made Milo's voice tried to sound like Fox, but did not come close to succeeding. <br /> <br /> If that says anything, my kids aged 10 and 6 are not even through the whole movie.
