I started watching this movie on t.v. a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. Initially, the person on the witness protection system in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his outer placed guards and then asks the guard in the house if he can make a phone call - only to find that the line has been cut. Shortly afterwards, Roy Scheider shows himself as one of the witnesses and executes the consciousness and his wife right - where the Roy Scheider figure properly picks up the weight phone in the kitchen, calls a number and So speaks: It's done !!!! It was for me!
