<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001 and watched it for about 45 minutes. I concluded that seeing a blank screen would be nice by comparison. There was not a single person in the cast for whom I would have beaten a tear if hell itself had opened and extinguished their whole pile. <br /> <br /> Then I sent all my friends and relatives warn them and I take the time to urge anyone who can see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but never one as bad as this.
