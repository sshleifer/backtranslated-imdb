The movie 'Heart of Darkness', based on the 1899 book by Joseph Conrad, is one with little or no detail and has an almost schizophrenic plot line. If you have read the book, you know that some of the important "story making" scenes were put into the movie. In the book there is so much left to the imagination, and I feel it is part of the book that makes the book what it is. An example would be when Marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets, and the whole scene was omitted from the movie. Again, if you have read the book, then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the most important theme of wickedness. Finally, I feel the film was too cut and dry. Not enough, even though it was put in the original text and how it made history what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book, 'Heart of Darkness' (preferably Norton Critical Edition), don't talk about your time renting or buying the movie. But if you have read the book, I think you will appreciate the book much more if you decide to watch the movie <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
