Set in 1976 with no apparent reason other than keeping the set dressers occupied, "The Box" was directed by Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko") and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who are probably struggling financially, though they both have a successful career - she is a high school teacher, he is an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia, Research Center. They have a child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, Lewises finds a packet on their door containing a black box with a large red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward 'indicating he is coming back at 5 pm to explain about the box. The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, shows up at the set time, exactly dressed in an elegant Savile Row suit. He is polite but business, but his most noticeable feature is his face, half of which seems to have been blown and mistakenly participated. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, but unfortunately he is upstaged by his own makeup, which is similar to that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolans 'The Dark Knight.' It's like the elephant in the room: you can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. If at that time they decide to unlock and press the button, he will give them $ 1 million in cash. The only catch - and it's a big one - is that a stranger's place will die. It may be across the city, it may be on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victim will be someone not known to them. As a show of good faith, he leaves them with a sharp $ 100 bill, their to keep whether or not they press the button. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical and believe it all to be a scam or elaborate hoax, but it's not long before they start wondering what would happen if they push the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would anyone really die? Without speculation, the Norma switches off. Nothing happens. But their original relief allows for alarms when Steward discovers the next day with a folder full of cash. They decide to call the whole thing off, but Steward tells them it's too late. "You have already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limo withdraws, Arthur notices the license number, which he later discovers, is registered with the NSA. <br /> <br /> At this point, the film begins to deeply penetrate into the epic space that the secondary character begins to skip the nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile, the city is being invaded by pudgy, gagged geeks in bad shirts that begin to follow Arthur around as a pre-bounce party for a run of zombie alien geeks. Arthur eventually gets caught by the threatening bookworm in the library (?), Where Steward's spinsterish wife turns out - which we haven't seen so far - and informs Arthur that he has to step into one of three to get out of the library vertical columns with cheesy digital water effects. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?" Arthur asks, apparently far less confused than he should be in the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is at this time. 'Eternal condemnation', the spider says spitefully. Arthur enters the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a short absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble pops out and Arthur tumbles on the bed in a shower of water, which strangely continues to drip from the overhead water just outside the camera area, while a soda and the Diaz flop are around the bed. <br /> <br /> It's confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> Finally, we learn that the Steward was once a PR officer for the NSA until he was hit by a flash bolt that destroyed some of his face. He was pronounced dead, but later he came back to life and was transformed into a kind of superman who now serves 'those who make lightning' and whose powers have allowed him to take over the CIA, NSA and NASA all by themselves . <br /> <br /> And what's the point of all this nattering nonsense? Apparently, Steward's mission is to expose people to some kind of biblical character test (eg, "Binding of Isaac") to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the keystone by refusing to push it, Steward's godlike overlord will save the tension. Unfortunately, the people who press the button, like Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral economy, at which end they are subjected to a series of sad 'Lady or Tiger' trials that play out as one of them 'So Movies "Except without the entertaining doings or the benefits of a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> 'The Box' represents the kind of meaningless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students would like to blather on after a few beers. Richard Kelly's boring exercise in existentialist pettifoggery, finally, under its own incomprehensibility, the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually collapses, as with the confusion of too many colors, into an enchanting gray goo of a movie as creepy as one of the narcotic in-flight films, whose plot no longer suffers from having been interrupted by a relaxed nap There is a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, a technically minded guy, gets curious about how the button works Open the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside. <br /> <br /> After seeing the box, I know exactly how he feels.
