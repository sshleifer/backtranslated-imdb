This movie was horrible and it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. The way I look at it is more like three mediocre discs in Disney cartoon episodes that stretch loosely together to make a single video pretending to be the sequel to the first Atlantis movie, much more suitable and fun. And where do I even start with the problems with this DVD? The story? The characters? The pictures / animation? For me, they are all bad and inflexible. First, the story in this direct-to-video DVD is ridiculous and pointless. The only good thing about it is that it is consistent - that is, consistently bad, from the beginning to the end. After the film's over, I still don't know why Milo has returned and how the events occur in the three little stories are related to each other or to Atlantis himself. And all I could remember about this movie was how bad it made me feel after seeing it. The characters feel wood and lack personality, and the drawings look very different than in the first. You can tell that they are obviously not from the same animators hands from the first. When the DVD was playing, I found myself increasingly concerned about what could happen to the characters and just hoped the movie would end soon. In addition to the story and the above characters, the picture quality is also poor in this, probably one of the worst in the direct-to-video products that Disney has ever released. As a fan of the original Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I couldn't be more disappointed with Milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. Thank goodness I rented it first instead of buying it. Still, I still wish I would never have seen this crap or even known its existence.
