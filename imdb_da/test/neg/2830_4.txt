This spying melodrama has a nice, almost promising cast, and should have been very atmospheric; there is a will or intention for the atmosphere ?? and also a will or lack of it. Sheen plays a dissident who now activates as an agent; he is a lonely, loved by women but arrogant; Mrs. Fossey is his mistress. Neill plays the gallant, generous, chivalrous Soviet agent. Sheen and Neill are both substantially annoying; Finlay makes a cameo, and so do other well-known actors. Mrs. Fossey is warm; But then again she is always. <br /> <br /> I want to be your true friend and break it to you? Flick is low in tension and on excitement it is tired and quite boring; The good thing is that you see Mrs Fossey naked. Other than that, lukewarm derived espionage exploitation.
