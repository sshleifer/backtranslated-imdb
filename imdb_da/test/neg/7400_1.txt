What a bloody nuisance! You can't get into topics like these with TV budgets and some smartass directors who can't tell the difference between a Lanc I, II, and III. All the stupid clich√©s are well in place; on character and human level, history is so scary and incredible that it hurts. And all those responsible are borne by the brilliant ratings. Technical details: waste. Lancs flying the dense would have kicked each other out of the sky by dozen. Single Engined Night Fighters are attacking the line astern: ridiculous. As I said, consisting of a director I bet on, never even heard the name Lancaster before the project and some young 3D guys who turned Lancs into waddling ducks. But these are small things in relation to the overall mediocrity of this movie. Although it may be too hard, I dare say it hurts those who died on both sides. TV crap, entertaining the stupid masses who don't care anyway. Shame on those responsible. Use your brains next time. And enjoy the profits you made from it.
