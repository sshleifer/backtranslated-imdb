Agreed this movie is well shot, but it just makes no sense and no need for how they did 2 hours as 3 just over a little love story, this could have been an episode of bold and beautiful or oc, in short you shouldn't see this movie, because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you from your sleep, I gave this movie 1/10 because it was the lowest and no this is not entirely based on a true story, more than half of It is made. I repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the movie is just a little too much, the actors' nasal voice makes me just want to blow my nose. Just you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge no-no.
