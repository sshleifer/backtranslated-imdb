Have you seen all the great adventures in the last couple of decades? If you have no problem with this, as you have already seen most scenes already - and I can guarantee that these scenes were originally in much better movies. The story (I'm sure true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that makes it play in a main line, would result in a bunch of angry goats). Each character is based in a cliché and ... well, they are nothing but the cliché. And yes, all you need to be a hero is American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland, they announced this to be the kind of movie the DVD was made for. Maybe I should sell my player so ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
