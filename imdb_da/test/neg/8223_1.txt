Garden State was at best a mediocre movie. The film seems more like a collection of thoughts that the author (Zach Braff) had, rather than a coherent story. The inconsistent plot may have been more engaging if it was not mixed with meaningless scenes that were no more than "quirky". Coincidentally, these scenes are often those that are being relayed in conversation (Zack passes by taps that turn as he passes, crazy under-cranked party scene, shouting for a gorge, the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The protagonist is flat, interrupted, and ultimately unlikely, exhibited most in the scene where he speaks to his father, independently ignoring his fathers' problems, including a recent deceased wife and droning about his own " What should I do with my life? "The problem. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to go back to LA because he can't tear himself away from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman), whom he has known in 2 days. It can only lead me to the conclusion that the film's message is that love at first sight hardenes business dilemmas ... Surely you can interpret it as an abuse of priorities, but if so, it could have been better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This movie does not know what it will be. A drama, a comedy, a teenage movie or a number of other things. I'm not saying this as a single-genre-oriented person, but as someone who loves multi-genre pieces like those who master Stanley Kubrick. The reason I feel it doesn't work for Garden State is because rather than mixing the genre together, it jumps around; one scene is a genre, the second and the other back and so on. Impressive as it was a first movie, I should think he could do better with as much money as he has. There have been much better first class feature film directors (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Maybe if he's stuck in writing or steering or acting, it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented performer, perhaps his second attempt is not so boring and uneven.
