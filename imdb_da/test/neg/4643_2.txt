I know that Full Moon, or any other movie studio for that matter, could never recreate the fun and cheesy sci-fi feeling that was the original `Trancers'. And with the last two entries in the series of Jack Deth in the Middle Ages instead of futuristic Los Angeles, it became quite clear that there was really little hope of reviving the Trancers series. Breathing new life into a movie is one thing, but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past, yes it didn't work! So now with Trancers 6, Full Moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we don't even handle Jack Deth anymore. We are now treating his daughter, Jo. Jack is in her body and has to go into the past and fight against Trancers again. <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILER: FIRST REVENUE FIRST * <br /> <br /> To prove how bad this movie is, you only need to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Deth appears on screen. But it's actually not Tim Thomerson. It's clips of him and sound bites tightly (believe me you can tell they are excited) terribly giving the viewer the last of the true Jack Deth humor. And from this point on things go only down the hill. Having this girl, Jo Deth, as our protagonist, while Jack Deth was to be in his body, is the worst idea in the world. Having this cute young woman seems like a hard and hard man is not the right track at all! It doesn't work, and it really looks stupid. I do not go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most read this know what the full moon has become: A truly, really low budget business. I don't know what to say about this movie unless I really want Full Moon to be as it was in Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers' days 1. At that time, special effects were not great, story story was. They made serious B-movies for serious B-movies and horror fans, and it just doesn't happen today with the new Full Moon Studios. I long for the good oil days and really hope Full Moon can pull out of this terrible decline that they are in right now. Trancers 6 get a 2 out of 10.
