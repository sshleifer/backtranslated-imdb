Got it out of the usenet so I wasn't prepared for the heavy (and I mean by the extraordinary heavy) religious theme. Not that I am one of Satan's disciples or anything, but it was very heavily survived. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the play was stunk. It might be because they had to get good little boys to play bad little boys, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> There was some beautifully cool filmwork so any fan of fanatical style might check it out, but be ready with the fast forward buttons. <br /> <br /> There was some dullness for editing. Especially a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Is squared against a white 240Z. The wheels spin, camera changes, and whattya know that the white 240Z is transmogrified to a white Civic. I gave up early so I can't guarantee the moral influence on it. But I would like to point out that this kind of film is entirely preaching to the choir. If the director / writer / producer tried to bring religion to the unwashed street racing lots, they went about everything wrong. I think I'd rather see an adult diaper commercial than listening to a steely-blown bible thumper about Jesus' dying for us. Grass. <br /> <br />
