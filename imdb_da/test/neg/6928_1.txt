I totally despise this movie. I would love it - I really wanted to. But man, oh man - they were so black with Sara. And the father lived was beautiful cheesy. It's just out of Shirley Temple movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend THE BOOK. It is fantastic. In the book Sara is honest and decent, and she does the right thing ... because that's right. She doesn't have a sharp leg in her body. <br /> <br /> In the film, she's crazy and patient. She does little things to get back to Miss Minchin. In the book, Sara is over such things. She stands up to Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not the flesh of her. But she does not do the stupid, horrible things Sara does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is really alarming to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie. I can't do without wonder ... have we read the same book? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility, behaving with honor and integrity, ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity. Sara has a good end in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the affiliation with her partner who has been searching for her. In the book she is taken by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep - that part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> To see all this praise for this miserable movie is disturbing to me. We look forward to a film that glorifies petty, horrible behavior with a few tips of hatred for kindness? Sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. I don't even recognize her in the movie ... she's not in it. Well, Mrs. Burnett is not alive to see this terrible thing. It is terrible and unworthy to wear the title of her book.
