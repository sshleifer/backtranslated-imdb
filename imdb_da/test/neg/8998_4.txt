This movie is entertaining if you like the poverty line, the first half of the 20th century, or the fan of amateur movies. The movie splits together public thrillers along with newly recorded scenes, where the "actors" (with the only exception of Redfield, who makes a near death on Lugosi rip, are all "performers" simply terrible!) Attempt to interact with stock footage. The "new" footage is covered with digitally added movie scratches, like some of the already substandard old footage (?? !!). As close as I can figure out, the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers brought together on an island for a will reading (?) This movie boasting a creative performance ala 'Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid 'is a technical and creative wreck. In a terrible long-range and injured sailor on a ship, an abortive trip to 'Fog Island' describes whatever it is! The "flashback" combines incoherent old recordings from completely different times and completely non-uniform film quality. Non-related scenes from 'The Lost World' (1925), The Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other poverty series productions. This is done over an incredibly bad voice, which apparently has too much room echo as if the sound was recorded on a cheap home camera. <br /> <br /> "The filmmakers" seem to think that they pay homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters surnames of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya etc etc ..). This tactic was made wise, as well as subtle in 'Final Destination' here it is just disgusting! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman abound. Even the old lawyer 'Dewey, Cheetam and Howe' lawyer's reference is used here - it was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The movie layer and sound, do not match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The final effect is that he seems to be getting older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. It was strange that the movie did not use this as a comedy subplot and wiped out a good chance of comedy. <br /> <br /> The truth is told, but it was fun to see it late at night in bed. Maybe that was what they wanted to do!
