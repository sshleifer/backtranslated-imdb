L'Auberge Espagnole is less fun and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where's their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A French man moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than themselves, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is incredibly bland. The only bright spot was a beautiful French girl playing a Belgian lesbian. She places her hands behind her head and reveals shaved underarms, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. But just armpits do not make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was fun, so was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard make you wonder what goes wrong with French comedy.
