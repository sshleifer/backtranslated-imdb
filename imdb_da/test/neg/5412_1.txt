God God for the DVR and the fast speed is fast forward. Even with that, I couldn't sit through more of that travesty. When they came across the old Indian who prayed for prayers, I gave up and deleted it. Is this the best thing SciFi Channel can do for Saturday night? What about some old classics instead? The idea of ​​a coed special forces unit was bad enough. It seems that they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods. What more can I say? It was so terrible that I didn't think I could come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it. But it seems that a line will do it again. Save your time, let alone your money on this dog of a movie.
