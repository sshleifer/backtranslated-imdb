This movie is okay, pretty stupid and must be taken lightly. But what I can't stand is the many heroes and the boy's defaulting comment at the end: "Look, they all look the same". Isn't it far beyond the good taste standards? I thought it was disgusting, like the heroic, selfless actions of some of the people in this movie. I am not saying that this does not happen, but to zoom in on all the courage as it does my stomach ache.
