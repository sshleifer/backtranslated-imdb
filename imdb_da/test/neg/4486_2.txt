The only reason I classified this movie as 2 is because Channing Tatumis beautiful but the whole movie lacks emotion and was boring to see. Usually I love a good romance, but it was just a waste of time, I didn't throw a tear despite the fact that it contained sad content, it just wasn't that good, it was good. I'm not a film critic, but I only advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you see it is to watch Channing Tatum lol the rest of the movie is garbage and if he wasn't in it (not his play was something good) I would have stopped looking much faster. It's a shame really because if the real actors were chosen for this movie, it could have had the potential to be a real tear. .. If you are looking for a good cry or a movie for a girly night in ... give this a lady !!
