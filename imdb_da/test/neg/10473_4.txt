I really don't know if it was science fiction or horror. It was confusing to say the least. What was really upset, however, was the lack of history development between the characters. The Sheriff's (Bruce Boxleitner) 17-year-old daughter (Clara Bryant) is stuck with him for the summer and they don't spend 30 seconds on the screen at all times. <br /> <br /> The hot Indian (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) apparently has hots for the Sheriff, but they don't spend any time together <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) ends up being dead and she had more ability to act than the other two. <br /> <br /> The bad developer vs the Indians is an overused story, but I personally like evil developers to get theirs when I live in Florida. The only reason I stayed with this was the creature. It was original. I've never seen anything like that, and I'm a sucker for new creatures.
