I thought this movie was a bad action from the British Film Council - fell flat like hey, come on, Tim Robbins is an old guy, and here is this beautiful young woman who is also falling right before him. Just as lost in translation, it is really difficult to suspend disbelief in this context. It is a nice movie, but it lacks kind. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he seems to have a little migraine. He looks uncomfortable and life less. The part where he screened suspected employees at the sphinx is ridiculous. If an investigator came to my factory, the last thing I wanted to do was tell him my fretish fetish. Of course it is over-intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a practical backdrop. Of course they chose the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a background, but the city never really comes out and affects the characters as in eg. Leaf runner, where the city's characters often cross history. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic highlights, so plot.
