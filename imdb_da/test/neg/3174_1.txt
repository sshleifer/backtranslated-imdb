This movie is cringingly bad. You can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly horrible movie. There are clear budgetary constraints, but with a little thought and attention to detail, the film could have been so much better. For example: Check out the scene where Mickey first goes to the mortuary and speaks to his friend the pathologist while the murdered taxi driver is on the plate. You can actually see the body breathing! What could they not afford to hire half a decent extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute scene?!
