This movie would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral and intense movie that many others in its genre have succeeded with, but it is not. It is at best confusing and absurd. When the twists finally revealed themselves, rather than saying "Ahh, I get it!" I muttered something like "Okay ... whatever." In my opinion, when a movie reveals a large plot twist, it must not be necessary to use a flashback sequence to prove that it gave some tips that would allow the viewer to discern the truth itself. But this movie has a flashback; and here is the kicker: it flashes back on scenes that were not even in the movie! The characters were stereotypical, unsympathetic and completely ridiculous. I feel that the "steaming" love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that I have ever seen in a movie that was not porn. It seems that the director went too shocking and kinky with the love scenes, but they were really just stupid. <br /> <br /> And don't even start me on crappy accents and second set sets. I suppose the movie was set in New Orleans, but apart from the aforementioned accents and a few cold cityscapes, the movie could have been in Anytown, USA. My recommendation: Don't bother!
