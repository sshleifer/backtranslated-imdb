I get the impression that I saw another movie for most other people I know who saw this movie. It's not really that I found the movie offensive or anything - just that the script was incredibly amateurish for a movie that of course had a little money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the "racism" version of Traffic, but I do not think that Traffic was really a movie that was worth ripping off in the first place. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this movie is the way the shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. Do Haggisreally think we are as stupid as demanding a shot of the subjects? Do you need to see the phonebook that is on Farhad's dashboard, with the address around in black text? Can't we be left to make a disadvantage in logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue, which was so 'on the nose'. I have heard a critic say that the quality of the dialogue is deceptively high, because even if people cannot speak in this way, they certainly believe this way. It is irrelevant. It is the task of a script like this to utilize the dialogue in a way that helps to add the characterization and credibility of the (in this case, highly unlikely) situations created. These characters all speak with the same voice, and all they are ever talking about is racism. <br /> <br /> Surely the purpose of a movie like this should be to promote the fact that race should not be a problem in these situations, but by making it the only focus in each scene, it does not become indately racist self? Characters walk around spitting their philosophies and conveniently memorized racial statistics, as if they are regurgitating excerpts from the research assignment they have just written. It is completely convincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A movie should reveal its meaning gradually and not let us face it in the opening scenes and never let it go. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this movie were honorable, but I dare suggest that by correcting his own script he could not identify and therefore overcome his mistakes. I really hope that the writer / director will be very cautious in the future as they approach this "mosaic" style of story. It has been done well a number of times, but achieving balance between personal and political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman won't be out of date in that department.
