This movie is an incredibly self-indulging piece that assumes that the pure impression of a story is as good as an actual story. It was utterly painful to see, and if I hadn't been suckered to buy DVD due to John Travolta and the positive buzz, I would not have finished seeing it. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks something resembling an interesting premise and seems to be dependent on heavy (and honestly high) characterization. There is a disgrace scene between Purslane and Bobby Long, where a television is destroyed, as when played out, is incredibly lax and mistreated. I found myself increasingly concerned about the characters that I saw. It was probably a lot of fun, movie-school-wise to do it. But it's just very boring to see. An indulgent and pretentious film school project that you should not waste money on.
