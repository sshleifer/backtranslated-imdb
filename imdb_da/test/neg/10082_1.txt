How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even sit through this 1 hour drive? There are so many stupid things about this movie, it's mind boggling !! I remember when I went to see JP as a child, it was my favorite movie and franchise, the actor, SFX Music, the direction! All in all, in my opinion, JP2 was pretty much the same except for some really stupid moments (as the gym girl kicked a raptor ... well!), But in a whole clever and reasonable movie experience. <br /> <br /> But the third has no meaning !! It was supposed to be a sequel to Carry's from JP2, yet it magically features new all-new stuff for the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the two previous films! for example: 1) The "new" mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell !! This thing follows them everywhere, they go, they can't escape their presence and yet in the lost world (the same island) do you see it once? can you hear it? Does it do any more than that? NONE! That's ridiculous !. The star character of the previous 2 films was, and will always be, T-Rex so what does d (urr) irector "Joe Johnston" do and do? Kill it! As soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its amazing roaring glory, it is killed and you never see it again - a new Dino on the town is the excuse. where did it come from !! ?? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on whole satellite phone-in-the-dino-belly stuff! 2) When you start over how stupid Spinosaurus are you see the Raptors, apart from their new "Punk" haircuts, they seem pretty credible! * Phew * they want to make this movie really visible? ... ERROR! now they talk to each other !! and the excuse for those who speak in this movie and not in the first and second is ... wait for it ... Evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended, great! surly they should have grown opposite thumbs and created tools now! OK, I no longer want to say about the plot because it comes up on my nose, so I'll close this: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a miserable sucker punch to any of the original fans in the series, my favorite franchise was good and really dead after seeing this Monstrosity (no pun intended) Avoid this movie like the plague
