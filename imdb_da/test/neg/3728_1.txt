It was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever put through. And that says a lot because I have seen my share of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen a movie where every character portrayed was an unintelligible loser. Seriously, there wasn't a respectable character throughout the script. How appropriate the plot was as lame, lacking any kind of intelligence. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even agree to join such stupidity. And while I haven't seen all their other movies, I've always had their performances so far. It wasn't that the play was bad, just the whole story was moronic.
