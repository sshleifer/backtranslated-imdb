Hooray for Title Misspellings! After reading the reviews and contemplating, my boyfriend and I confirmed that this movie is a whole piece of trash can. This movie lost her as one of the rare Tarantino fans. I wish it was made on nitrate film, and all the copies neatly stacked under a chain-toxic Tarantino fanboy. The literally inevitable violence, the plot holes, Tarantino's table-it sans drama and absent-minded development made this a thoroughly painful, glorified assembly. <br /> <br /> What happened? And how much of it was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I see my share of fansubbed anime and kudos for attempting authenticity, but it was overdone for an English language movie. With the clear historical flaws, the constant reading killed what worked there. <br /> <br /> Why pay money to a narrator who definitely doesn't want to tie to any of the characters, plots, themes, settings or anything involved in the movie? When the film needs that kind of explanation, it is the foreclosure of the full filth that follows. <br /> <br /> Historical research - while sprinkling with interesting facts, using the right costumes and props for the soldiers, this film stretched the truth beyond the belief itself for historical fiction. Kudos at the Mata Hari reference, although using it as foreshadowing was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing team, not cattle in an isolated room. This ruined every sense that the reference might have had. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience, all these and other references were completely lost by many who would bother to see this movie and anyone who would enjoy it. I'm confused by his choice of when to start a scene, finish it, and what to include. Why did it take nearly 20 minutes to create a kind of testosterone in a movie that was promoted as an action movie? <br /> <br /> What I think the message was trite. The idea of ​​rats and how we deal with a primal nature against them, and "who is the rat?" was at best cliched, but at worst not realized. Mentioning American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this issue of moral high ground. Literally, every character in the film that has a talking role is captured in their own legend. Is that the world Tarantino lives in? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I'm sorry I bothered to see it at all, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich idea basis for development, but no one was realized.
