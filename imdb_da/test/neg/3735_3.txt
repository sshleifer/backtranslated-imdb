Feeling Minnesota isn't really a road movie, but it's still the best categorization I can generate. A road movie is not primarily dependent on a great storyline, and since the plot of this movie is truly pathetic, it fulfills that description. To be interesting, such a movie should rely solely on moving and exciting characters, and on chemistry between them. Unfortunately, the Feeling Minnesota staff completely fails to produce this excitement. <br /> <br /> The initializing presentation of the characters is unsatisfactory and confusing; For example, I cannot figure out whether Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in his mother and brother's house or not. It's said by his mother (Tuesday Weld) that he has to live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never know them. They seem irrational and there is no real explanation for why they do it. The bottom line is that I leave the film without feelings for the characters, except for stupidity and perhaps a little kick of attraction for the sweet Cameron Diaz.
