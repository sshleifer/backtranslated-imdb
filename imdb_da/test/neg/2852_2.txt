This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the look of beautiful Lydie Denier in some of the scenes. In spite of her 42 years she is a fantastic woman in every aspect, her naked scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is as good as hell. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the movie, nothing is really interesting to say, a Neonazi and a Turkish gang fighting over Berlin in scenes that include people opening fire on the street in daylight and in a club where 30-40 people are firing at each other with machine guns in a place that is no bigger than my house and astonishing after some hours of shooting only three dead and ten are injured LOL. <br /> <br /> While the gang is fighting over the Berlin interiors, a serial killer kills young children and then dumps them painted white in various places in the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as the Turkish detective, who, while now working for the police, was a former leader of the Turkish gang and is now able to solve the serial killer's crimes. The film is of course a very bad rip off of the classic M film. The killing of the children, the inclusion of the underworld, the nature of the serial killer and the end stage of the "trial" of the serial killer is more than influenced by this classic movie. The play is terrible, the manuscript is just stupid, the production of the lowest possible standards and generally this was a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Don't even disturb renting this one.
