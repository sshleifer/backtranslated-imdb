Then the oblique update goes and shoots through the head. Rather, it is expedient that, in view of the tedious state of this film, a sequel to a movie that did not need a person. What really annoys Robocop 2 is that the decision makers obviously didn't understand why the original was so good at first. Robocop (7) was a witty, live satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Thin on dialogue, especially toward the dull, shoot-out finale, attracts little interest and holds none of the original energy or spirit. Spoof the ads, now a bit tasteful ("Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer") seems only there as an afterthought. And calling a new designer fabric "Nuke" is not as close as subtle or fun as the original family board game, "Nuke ?? em!" <br /> <br /> Stop-motion animation ?? the weakest element in the original ?? used more extensively, while this humorous sequel fails to include a credit sequence, making it look even cheaper and hurried. Oh, humorous? You might say. But what about the fun mayor or how Robo is reprogrammed to empty the plateaus? Yes, there are attempts at light relief, just as Robo tightens up with a screwdriver ("we are human only") to the film's stroke, but no one is likely to induce laughter. Like the rest of the movie, they are stubborn and moronic attempts at entertainment. The third and final film in the series (Fancifully titled Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leave, to be replaced by Robert John Burke, who does well in an indispensable role. With toned-down language and violence, it was a clear plea for the nursery, a Robo action figure that was highly plugged throughout. With the social conscience too exaggerated, and Robopopo's new found arm attachments and jetpack becoming too stupid, the final film was never intended to be a masterpiece. Another wet direction by Fred Dekker and a floating pace makes this a nice throwing view. <br /> <br /> Robocop is the movie right. Robocop 3 is the sequel that you could see if there was nothing better. Which leaves the other movie hanging in the middle, a relentless dirge of a picture. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say, stores for the pounding signs that smoke. Irvin Kershner is no Paul Verhoven, like comic artist Frank Miller and partner Walon Green are not the authors who were Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. A tragic waste of a good, if limited, concept. 10.4.
