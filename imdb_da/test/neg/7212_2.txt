Well, let's be righteous. Following up on a cult classic like Road House is no easy task. Now drag Swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task. So with Patrick not on board, whose main idea was to continue anyway and do this piece of garbage? I must blame the director who didn't even give 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the film. I was actually shocked that they got Will Patton (Armaggedon) to board. Johnathon Schaech did an OK job with the management, but the writing was horrible. To knock down his partner brunette bombshell (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes of the movie made me push it right there. But I'm stuck in the movie and hope to catch a glimpse of the great cheesy humor that worked so well with Double Duece. No such luck. The cover of the DVD is fun, they show these two stacked blondes that make a 10 second look in the movie. In fact, Costar Ellen Hollman puts a decent performance. But again, the effort is in vain in a piece of waste and disgrace like this. Has Jake Busey ever been cast in a decent movie? Couldn't they draw at least a few actors from the first movie to some kind of nostalgia? Even one of the old bouncers or two, or Jeff Healey for a show would have been nice. Take this movie out of your queue right away. -LostFlix
