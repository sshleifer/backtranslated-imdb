First: A warning. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie on DVD in the Universal 'Hitchcock Collection' series. The source print appears to be in perfect condition, but the image is slightly soft, suggesting that it may be another generation copy from video. The frame is too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the movie is cropped. I collect from other IMDb reviews that there is a much better version. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith are just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. In his long interviews with Francois Truffaut in the 60s, Hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his entire work, but all he could say about this image is that he did it as a benefit to Carole Lombard and that he didn't understand the characters. then just photographed Norman Krasna's manuscript. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little more to be said. <br /> <br /> It's a screw basketball comedy out of the same mold that happened one night, his girl Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typical feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, coincides with her husband at the most glaring of advances and spends most of the image as "adorably" unreasonably. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery does well as a man, but it's hard to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the film, the audience says: "Dump the stupid cow, it's not worth it." <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she gets engaged. He was supposed to be a legal, "old family" southern, although it is not clear from his accent and only becomes apparent in the drunken scene (which he otherwise plays very well). He is a reputable, generous, teetotal gentleman, so of course he is bullied and patronized by Robert Montgomery and made many of the jokes - even though he is not as badly treated as the similar Ralph Bellamy character in his maid Friday. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like it was made by people who only knew about scrubbing comedies with reputation, but hadn't seen one. For example, a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a series of ongoing comics that continually unite and overlap. Here, all the comedy elements are just stretched out like pearls on a necklace. This is the screwball comedy of the numbers. <br /> <br /> It's the same with the direction. Typically, these comedies run along with an ever-increasing pace that rises to near hysteria at the end. Hitchcock doesn't get this. His direction is somewhat dull, and the image becomes a stately sequence of scenes, all of which seem a little over-written (but malnourished) and a little too long. He was never a very good director of actors, so he just lets the cast move on with it. They do it right. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a great sense of humor, which he often used in his thrillers, but he had no sense of comedy as a genre. His later problems with Harry were also a misfire, for similar reasons to this movie, but at least he was involved in that image. Here he just goes through the movements. <br /> <br /> All the people associated with this movie were good solid professionals, so it's not very bad. It just feels a little distracted, overcrowded, oblong and ultimately flat. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith are one for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock compliments.
