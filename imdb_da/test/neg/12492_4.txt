I was expecting much of Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role, SARKAR, but I'm disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma direction I was not ready for this kind of movie. Sarkar must be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on power other than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the GOD FATHER theme, and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power to the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The film fails to show the strong influence of the Father of God.
