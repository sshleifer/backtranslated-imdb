Solange is not a fantastic Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, the professor, didn't. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he couldn't have been the killer from the beginning; He and a student experienced the first murder. So there is absolutely no excitement as to whether or not the professor is the killer. There is a long, dull structure for the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) just isn't exciting enough to keep your interest. Even in the "wrong man accused" tradition, it fails because the police never accuse the professor seriously, and the killer is never after him. Boring, boring, boring.
