Do not waste your time. One of the cool boxes that you pick up on Blockbuster on a hunch, but not even worth it. You won't say, "It's so bad, it's good." Just, "It's bad." The largest American hero is a writer who rents a cabin on the African island, called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on the boat that lets him away, but they are not staying on the island. They just stop there to leave the author. Then the boat is stranded there, and in true Hollywood originality the only radio on the island is busted. So they start to walk around and see a lot of snakes. Like hundreds of them, which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere. It's not like there was ever a head snake. Like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes. Instead, there is only one bunch of him-and-egg tubes of all kinds of breeds. Their only goal was then to escape the island ... as opposed to conquering the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew they couldn't try to kill them all and they didn't try. I have seen a similar movie where a city was haunted by snakes, and they bring all the snakes into a cave and blow it up. At least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and that was a normal ending. In Snake Island (by the way, every single person was shocked to see snakes on the island ... duhhhhh, it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no plan to try to get gas for the stupid boat. Oh, they never get gas by the way. They "just happen" to find another boat on the island that's already gassed up.
