I really should give this stinker more credit as 1 star because the film has so many eye rolls that it's almost the price of the rent. <br /> <br /> If you want to call it, the actor is so stylish and confident that it makes Ed Woods actors alive. "Sammy," the lonely black person, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in his other films, but he has zero-acting ability. His lines are invaluable because of his absurd delivery, although I suppose the intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old man in his second turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") is no budget, junior high school quality, with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair. <br /> <br /> I can't fathom anyone actually buying this video unless people like to throw their own Mystery Science Theater parties and need a copy of something like this at hand. It's really Beyond Fear - it's actually Beyond Funny.
