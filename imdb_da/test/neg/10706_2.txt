They used pictures of some genuine protest spliced ​​with a woman who spoke of a non-men's community to make it seem like these people were cheering for men's gender concept. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background. Okay, plotted. Some lady says there must be a community without men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) thinks it's a good idea. Then all the men are killed or something. Then there is no more. <br /> <br /> Then this blonde researcher creates a man but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent. The male grows very quickly and soon becomes a mature man. Not long after he takes the blonde's Volkswagen beetle and goes into the city where he is discovered. Now you would think that the lonely man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever, but no way. Police chase him. <br /> <br /> I didn't look at the rest, but it probably ends that they have to fight the clock, and some people, or something bad, will probably happen. Somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to rebel. These brave warriors hiding in a stadium could have had some sort of plan that made the details of how they would get rid of a planet full of women, but I didn't see it. And neither should you. <br /> <br /> If you are not late and canal surfing and this happens to come on, do not see. See anything but this. You will find these ads for Bowflex or those with women in swimsuits asking you to "download the phone to meet women like these" in your area will be more satisfying entertainment. <br /> <br /> (Oh yeah, it's fun when they pull in their cars. I don't know what they did, it seems they were running very slowly and carefully, but then tried to speed up the movie to compensate, but it just looks strange.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was cute and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
