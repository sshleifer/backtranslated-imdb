Not much to say other than lots of Wire-fu and supposed Sholin monks ego-tripping about Kung-fu and caricature Japanese planning to take over China. All this would not be so bad, if not for the totally fake Japanese sword battles. If you watched a samurai movie or two, you can tell that the "Japanese" fighting in the movie is simply the same "Kung-fu" (really circus acrobats) stunt men who do the same things except with a Japanese sword. There are, however, a few fun moments that reach a Japanese woman, Ninja, tears her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and catch him with a fishing net. Historically, there seems to be little schizophrenia, as far as the Japanese are to appear as completely despicable or if there may be exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is shown to be virtually honest, but not beyond unjustified cruelty, as if he were killing a sedated monk so he could have his duel. Quite disappointing with a very silly end. Do not momentarily evoke the moment's idea of ​​an epic battle.
