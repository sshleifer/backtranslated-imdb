Mr. Moto's Gamble has a rather straightforward plot - when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it is up to the even more mysterious Mr. Moto to resolve the matter. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked at the number of positive reviews by Mr. Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because I ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I enjoy Mr. Moto and I enjoy Charlie Chan, but I can't say I cared about these two mish-mash. For those who are not familiar with the story of Mr. Moto's Gamble, it was originally planned to be a Charlie Chan movie. But when Warner Oland backed-out some of the scenes and actions were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I stated, the result ended me underwhelmed. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He is more mysterious, he is more athletic, and he is more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is like trying to fit a square stick in a round hole - it doesn't work. And listening to Lorre / Moto trying to deliver one of Chan's euphemism's trademarks, just stops silly. Add to the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already short 72-minute run-time consists of boxing scenes (something I never seem to enjoy) and you end up with a movie that I couldn't help but dislike. If I have to say something positive, I will point out Keye Luke's performance. But he himself is not close enough to save Mr. Moto's Gamble in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best I can give it.
