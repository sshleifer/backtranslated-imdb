Yes, quite awful, and it comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there is a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / thrill movies and have seen wonderful work from European filmmakers. Broceliande is unfortunately not among them the wonderful pieces of film making. The camera's work is worse than amateurish. Not the fashionable, appalling MTV "camera man needs Ritalin" type of camera work, so many filmmakers use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply poor frame composition and awful image composition. The action is farcical when it is not completely two-dimensional. The dialogues are stylish and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror / suspense film that kills into pseudo-mysticism. I think that which shot me the most was the horrible choreographed battle scenes at the end of the movie. These were bad to be ridiculous. I have seen what a small budget can do and it can do wonders. This was just a bad film production. Very, very sorry.
