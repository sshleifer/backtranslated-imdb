OK, I've seen over 100 Troma movies, and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach USA" was horrible, and "I was a Teenage TV Terrorist" was not available, but this is the WORST MOVIE IN THE FAITHFUL LIBRARY! <br /> <br /> A bunch of women are being held in prison and tortured as they attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> This is really terrible. Even as an exploitation movie goes. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the instructor if they saw this bad excuse for a cult movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
