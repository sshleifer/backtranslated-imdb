First of all, let me start by saying that I have been a devoted supporter of C Thomas Howell's career since "The Outsiders" and "The Hitcher". He was an up and coming star in the 1980s - with hits like "Soul Man" too. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to continue from there and truly claim himself in Hollywood. Put it this way - Tom Cruise had a little bit in "The Outsiders" while Howell had the lead. Look at Cruises today !!! But picking material like this drive will only mitigate Howell's career even more - if possible. Why does he choose things like this? A small part in a larger movie would be more beneficial to him than this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story goes on here in a post-apocalyptic world, where everyone lives underground, where chaos rules. Howell is a shepherd - protecting the herd of various religious leaders by killing any unwanted ones. He's a hitman in other words. The sets are so bad they wouldn't look in place on a Thunderbird's episode. The use of slow motion inevitably repeats throughout the film, but is well backed by bad acting (and badly is a friendly word here), no continuity, scenes thrown in for no reason, vehicles that looked like Whether they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that borders on stupidity. Oh yes, and the story was also pathetic. I hate writing bad reviews about movies - especially those I really like the star - but this movie is so bad that I don't believe in a second that someone could have been proud of it. I am not a filmmaker, nor am I a director, but I would save my head in the sand if I had spent some money and time on this movie. In short - it was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to ever watch this movie. It came free with a DVD player I bought, but I still hit the case halfway through because I was embarrassed by Howell. Come on C - give yourself a credit and fight yourself away from these unaffected wonders and try to break down and get a good deal - though small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.
