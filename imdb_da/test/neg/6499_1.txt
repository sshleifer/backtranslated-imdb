Seen in a post-apocalyptic future, the new highlander is a widespread little check called Quentin MacLeod, which is being mentored by a new Ramirez while his little sister tags together on their quest to counteract an evil immortal superior. To do so, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this supreme Korton does. <br /> In short, it's pure crap, just like the Highlander sequels. Quentin is a rather stupid character who constantly whining and groaning and bitching in a "ve me for a reluctantly quite" kind of way, and he never catches on being an immortal and cannot be killed by at least not easy. Ramirez would have done better to itch and ban Korton himself.
