This movie was shot in Randolph County in central North Carolina in 1968, when a movie crew member in the state was a rare thing. The location was the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural landscape. It's not a very good movie. It had Merle Haggard, and it brought life to the hinterland in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The reason is the standard shootemup. The cinematography is the fuzzy thing that came out of the late 60s and early 70s. The local people were thrilled to be part of the business. <br /> <br /> If viewers find it difficult to find a copy of this movie, there is a record copy available in Asheboro, NC. <br /> <br /> Non-credited actors include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nunnery.
