I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, it seemed to someone who had seen it, loved it. I was totally disappointed. The action was so overdone. The script found that the author had collected 25 different scripts from different movies and randomly selected dialogue and pieced them together to form a plagarized script. Spoilers: Was there any clichel left out in this movie? There was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, many godfather wannabees, the protagonist in love with the prostitute, cross dressing, police torture, Hannibal Lechter style changes, I could go on and on again. <br /> <br /> Line is like (godfather wannabe to the prostitute) <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I don't want you to work any more) <br /> <br /> - "Is calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if I didn't work) <br /> <br /> Unrealistic scenes: We never saw a single policeman under the serial killers, but when the protagonist disappeared, his father was taken by the police and tortured for weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can make sense of this whole movie is if the version I had on stage was heavily edited from the original. I definitely do not recommend it and it would be very much to discuss it with everyone who would like to. <br /> <br />
