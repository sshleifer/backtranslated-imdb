This movie is total killing. I love Val Kilmer and was very surprised earlier this year by "Felon" (a good movie!). The entire DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer, while being billed as one of the most important people in this movie, is in the movie for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not entirely true. This could have been a good movie, but the direction was horrible and the plot was as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually when a movie is this awful, you can sit back and laugh at it. However, this movie is so bad and boring, I actually fell asleep to it (which I never do during a movie). AVOID ALL COSTS!
