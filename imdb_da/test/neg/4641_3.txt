This movie was horrible ... How can anyone even think that this movie was like them back in the "good old days" when Tim Thomerson wasn't even there. And to make matters worse, they used clips from old trance films. It's just awful. No trance film is finished without Tim Thomerson. I love Fullmoon movies and I've seen them since I was 4 years old. I've been through everything they've done, and this movie almost made me lose it. Now I have a few lines to fill, so I will continue. Their way of breeding new trancers is quite stupid as well as the way to send Jack back in time. What happened to the TCL chamber. And finally! What happened at the end of trance 5 where lina says and I quote "Jack has given me something special" and her and another broad look at her belly. I don't know ... maybe there's a BABY in there. There were so many other places to go to, but the fullmoon was the bed
