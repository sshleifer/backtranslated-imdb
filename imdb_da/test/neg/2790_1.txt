The first opening scene, which lasted about five minutes, showed the potential to become an instant classic with moderate to good acting, great movies, a story that keeps the sound up and one in the corner of the screen a spooky "do you see!" (Scarecrow moving). After the quick set-up of history that would enter the present, it was as if someone had written and directed the rest of the "movie". The next scene is a basic sketch of how the movie goes downhill as a race car. It seems that the rest was shot in video with crazy "porn style actors", the set design was a law office with almost nothing on bookshelves or anything in the office at all. <br /> <br /> I just remember watching crap horror movies for a chance to see some naked "teenage" girls, then there was no Victoria's Secret mags everywhere, and not looking at things that make big horror movies today as action, terror, excitement, intregue, etc. It took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die. When it did, I and my friends were so shocked by the "WORST" costume of a "monster". OVEN, we booing through our popcorn on the TV screen.
