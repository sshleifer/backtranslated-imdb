I don't like this show. I believe that everyone in that school is pretty much perfect and rich, and I doubt that a boarding school will look as cool as that. And why do they suddenly allow girls in school? Isn't it just a little strange? Anyway, Jamie Lynn spears can't act. She always has the same facial expression that really annoys me. She is virtually numb and all the guys seem to like her. <br /> <br /> And shouldn't she tell her he likes her? it's not that hard! really! None of this show is real life and she is not "a girl like me" because the majority of ordinary girls do not go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes and do NOT live at the beach. <br /> <br /> False False False.
