Respecting Western Author Budd Boetticher is violently out of place with this choppy modern policeman and robbery story suffering from a strong lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have dropped repetition time and definitely for the first time as leaders Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put some effort into their roles and delivered lines flat and without energy. <br /> <br /> Mild mannered employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works as an inner man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. Hundreds of police are being mobilized to prevent him from coming to the home of the intent who has moved to another place, but if you did not know in the last few moments of the movie, we have poor subsequent feet behind the victim (who somehow Taking a bus back to the house was a good move, while a company with the police observing and biting over what to do. Sound preposterous? You should see it. It's all this and more. <br /> <br /> Lucien Ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs, but editing is scaly and formless and it drains the movie of its excitement and pace. As Poole, Wendell Corey is the best in the movie that manages to bring about great sympathy as he passes from gentle soul to murderer. These attributes distinguish Killer uniformly in design and execution, making the message clear. Go Western Old Budd.
