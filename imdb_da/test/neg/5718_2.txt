After a long hard evening, was attached to the Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pick-up. My neck was hurting, my wallet was empty, and I ended up chatting with a drug addict at a bus stop and trying to sell me some petrol. Today I looked at "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do right now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors of various shapes and sizes to reclaim a green stone from an evil queen whose motives are not fully explained. Yes, it is so good. "Red Sonja" is not in a genre known for amazing movies until Peter Jackson joined a particular Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, I could think of the best sword-and-thrill movie before "Lord of the Rings" was George Lucas' kiddie-friendly "Willow". Maybe you should go a little light on this movie. But I can't - it's badly written, badly acted (except Paul Smith, who is just average) and terribly put together. The movie is as convincing as an episode of Flintstones, with costumes and scenes apparently lifted just above Bedrock. Considering the cartoon source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child in this world or one is confusing. His personality seems to flirt from the spoiled abrupt to polite gentleman by a switch. Schwarzenegger shows less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the movements, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It is easy to kick a movie when you are down, but the fact is that this is not a good movie, in any way of imagination. When Nielsen cares for her sister's death, Schwarzenegger puts her hand on her shoulder to comfort her and blurs into the clear German accent, "she's dead", so you know you're in a tough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestess of a temple who, when they sent them to death in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least judging from the orgasmic moans, who seemed to echo around the place. If you are going to see an 80s fantasy film that wasn't porn, then see "Willow" (but never take it as a ringing endorsement). For the right thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a good job he did with "Lord of the Rings". Believe me, 11 Oscars really means it's a good movie - unlike bloody "Titanic".
