MGM hodgepodge by Jimmy Durante throws a big party for everyone in Hollywood. No big stars come up - we get the three stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reason). The movie contains annoying unfunny jokes and some really horrible songs and choreography. The only thing that saves this from being a total disaster is Laurel & Hardy's "fight" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful color Disney cartoon called "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost. Otherwise, the movie is a colossal bore. There is no director credited - what do you tell it?
