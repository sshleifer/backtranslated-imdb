Wow - Thank goodness I was on a plane and could look out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly acted (who in the hell was the horrible woman who played the wife?), Poorly cast, terribly written. This movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person who is willing to kneel on the altar of either firefighters specifically, "Heroes" or gods in general, I suppose. I just don't have enough bad things to say about this movie. Nor could it have been cheap, with all the stars in it plus all the special effects and fire scenes. Had to have cost a fortune, but it still sucked worse than any movie I can even remember watching. Funeral Scene? Astonishingly bad rope ship between firefighter and the aforementioned horrible woman? Corny, contrived, trite. Firehouse Pranks? Let us not all wish we could be both so male and boring at the same time.
