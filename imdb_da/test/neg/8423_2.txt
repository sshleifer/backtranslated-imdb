So what is one to do if you are a porn star with fading looks? I know will be a pop star! This documentary - and I use the phrase loosely - follows Colton's trials and trials as he attempts to transform himself from a gay porn star to a singer of electronic (dance) music. I just want Ford's voice to be as muscular as his arms ... sorry to say that his vocals are painfully thin. There is not much interesting going on here, but Mr Ford and friends are eye candy. Watch him record a song that looks exactly like any other thoughtless dance mode. See him travel to New York to make "connections." See him go back to L.A. with a little success. See yourself looking in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting time watching this mess?"
