This is on my TV right now ... but only long enough that I can finish it in this comment. The previous comment tells me that this movie doesn't get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I agree with this movie is a tremendous waste of my time and that would be your time ... it will not be better! I can't believe this script does Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million times! I see some other credits on his CV that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with his work, write something here because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and would hate it if that guy hit it in the bin that this movie turned out to be.
