When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly saw the actor playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. Thinking of a legend that Lucille Ball was portrayed as she was in the movie is horrible. I can't believe all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She can be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It's pretty hard to find someone who might look like Lucille Ball, but at least they could find someone a bit similar in appearance and talent. If you've noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I love Lucy as the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is in any way the same, her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> For the very best, Danny Pino plays Desi Arnaz is terrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He is small and thin, his accent is unreal, and once again his plays are incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not alike, they were not as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely horrible casting and history is badly told. If people want to understand Lucille Ball's real life situation, I suggest seeing A & E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book by Lucille Ball himself or PBS's American masters: Find Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the Laughter" would be a better choice. Casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect appears instead of nothing.
