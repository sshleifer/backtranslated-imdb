The supposed author and director Mr.Dhawan has copied almost the entire plot of the magnificent Hollywood movie "HITCH" with Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was just copied inserted and some low-quality humor (probably mr.Dhawan's own creation) and frequent dance was added to increase the movie time to local standards. Although Salman Khan and Govinda's plays gave us some smiles, but it doesn't fit legendary artists like them to be part of plagiarism, especially when they even tell people to stop buying pirated disks!
