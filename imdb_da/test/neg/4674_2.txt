I watched this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried that I'm turning to one of the left liberals, who rightly make it fun in South Park. Because I found it very offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, it is the old staple that America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything ever. <br /> <br /> Second and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike that hits some (not named why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "my God, imagine the tragedy that * could * happen". Because you know it happened to Asians. It can happen to white Americans, and * it * would be tragic. <br /> <br /> Later, a larger meteor hits Paris. Our throw on the ground is annoyed, for it may mean that our boys have less time than they thought. Not much disturbed in America. No one to mention that many people are dead. <br /> <br /> There is Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never a black man has been so token. Among a team of hardcore drills, his job seems to consist of standing in the back and sometimes saying "Hey, you man". Really. Why did they even take him with him? It's not like he's petit - he weighs down the shuttle for nothing! Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a meaningless role), he does not lift a tool, steer a spaceship or help fix anything that pops up. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut who seems to be full of times and hits things with the keys instead of fixing them, because "That's how we do it in Russia," it's pretty terrible . Of course, everyone cemented the blonde side, blue-eyed American children, all celebrating in cornfields being rescued and everything is okay. Because all death and destruction for the rest of the world is irrelevant. You expect the bad manuscript, the risky play, the unhappy plot (obese, medieval men are trained for 12 days to be astronauts? Including one that seems to be delayed?). But I could not believe in racism and xenophobia implicated in the movie and the creepy disregard for the lives of anyone who is not corn-fed Americans. It is a chilling accusation of the attitude of a part of Western Society to the world. <br /> <br /> And it's also a crappy movie.
