There is not enough room to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess. Stupid special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of the film's problems. The film looks as if it was perceived in the mid-eighties and was just stowed until it could finally be made in the early 90s. The mullet-headed "hero" (complete with the fashionable "Miami Vice" three-day shadow beard), him-fisted slams by Ronald Reagan, would be fun if it didn't take that seriously. As it is, the movie is just pathetic. In fact, I feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine naked scenes in this horrible movie.
