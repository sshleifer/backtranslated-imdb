I began to take a critical look at this adaptation within the first few minutes, but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I continued to the end ... But this is not a program I would recommend to anyone who is not familiar with her work as I do not think it does the book justice, nor does it make particularly entertaining television itself. There was something about this adaptation that lacked credibility - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look, and I found that the play was sometimes poor. There is no doubt that the actors were all very nice, but it did not give enough variation to create really different, memorable characters. It was far too statically quite in the same place and lacking Fanny's home, which is one of the most interesting parts of history. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who caught Edmund's sweetness very well, and Crawfords were also effectively thrown. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was much better played by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version, which generally gave a much more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen adaptations will always give a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately this is one of the worst things I've seen.
