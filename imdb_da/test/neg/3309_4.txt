Like many other people I have heard of "more" and I wanted to see it because of the music composed by Pink Floyd. I have to say that I was really disappointed, not because of the music, but the film itself. It's a dull, uninhibited movie that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? According to me from different things. First and foremost, the subject of the film is poorly linked to the inactive sunny atmosphere of the film. This should have taken place in the neat areas of Paris and should have born a dark and helpless climate, for example. In addition, it must tell a descent into hell, but this descent is softened and barely outlined. Barbet Schroeder does not insist enough on the dramatic side of the story. You might have wanted a little more madness, cutting. In another way, Schroeder does not succeed in getting the audience to feel and feel towards the distress of the two main characters. You carelessly see their experiment with matter. While the two main players, they are completely unthinkable and hardly evolve under the film, especially Mimsy Farmer. At the end, you only preserve the beauty of the Mediterranean landscape bathed in sunlight. The movie created a great feeling when it was released in 1969. Today it seems <br /> <br /> to be dated. The hippy culture is nothing short of a distant memory.
