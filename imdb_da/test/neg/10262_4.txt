So last night and a fan of the first demons, I had hoped that the successor would have the same fun, eerie spirit of his predecessor. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The lineup is the same as the first one, where a horde of meat-damaging demons is actually emerging from being released from a horror movie being played ... (The first was a cinema, this takes place in an apartment complex and on television.) When the demons is released, follows madness and mass carnage. It is pretty much what it is about plot development. It worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make-up FX, fast pace and unpredictability. However, the successor does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many signs that we do not care at all. If they were annoying or idiots, there would at least be some kind of satisfaction when they were inevitably slaughtered / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people are just kind who are waiting to be slaughtered. The fact that most characters are in different parts of the apartment house (and out of it), they constantly switch back and forth between those who kept me pulling me out of the story. There are some entertaining bits, courtesy of splatter FX and campiness. As a constant stream of bleeding blood eats through one storey construction after another as if it were foreign acid ... The first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of all her parties, and a creepy demon child clapping his way in a tenant's room that is pregnant with a child. But this order goes into a ridiculous-looking rubberman's baby puppet thing that bursts from the breast of the human child who constantly flies across the space of the intended victim. I have a couple of chuckles out of that scene, but I don't think it was Bava's intention. The scene would probably have worked better if they just kept the baby demon around to attack the woman, but hey ... Other little things like the overgrazing action of most characters and the bad dubbing do not help. In summary, I managed to see the non-classified version on DVD, and I can't imagine having to go through the previously only available R-rated version because the make-up FX and Gore were all I came out of it . Also noteworthy is an early role producer of Argentina's future hottie daughter, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best performance of the entire cast and she is hardly on the screen. The Argento / Bava's fan might just check it out to see it, but will probably find itself on their watch as I did. Gore fans can get a kick out of some, but will laugh out of their chairs on the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet since Little Selwyn from Dead / Alive. You can do worse, but it certainly does not live up to the original.
