First, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both created these movies and defined Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after seeing this movie I would much disagree. There are some good special effects with the alien vampires, and the story may have been acceptable. I just can't get past a naked woman's spacecraft in the whole movie, it's totally absurd (even though she looks good). Add in a bunch of bad British actors and that's pretty much OVER. Most of the movie ends up in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of a true Si-Fi Horror action and excitement. <br /> <br />
