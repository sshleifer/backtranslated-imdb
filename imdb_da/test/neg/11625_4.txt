When I was a little girl, I absolutely loved The Swan Princess, it revived the same adventures of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince, who saves the day, is always a timeless story that will never die, Well, hopefully. But I figured I wanted to see the successors of The Swan Princess to see how they were, and unfortunately it is the typical comic book that just disappoints more than entertaining. The only sign I still found very entertaining was the queen, she was very fun in this movie and had the best. But with the voice changing, they were noticeable and also bothered me a little, I don't mean to be fussy, but it was too strange for me. The story was also more or less borrowed from the first swan princess, but the villain in this movie follows Rothbart's footsteps. Odette and Derek are celebrating their one year anniversary, but Derek has also been keen to fight for his kingdom to keep it safe. When his mother's birthday also comes up, he forgets it because there is a new villain in the town of Clavious, who hopes to go beyond where Rothbart's powers went and kidnap the queen on her birthday. But Odette must switch back to her swan herself to help Derek fight him and save her mother. The Pig Princess 2 is of course more than okay for the kids, I never mind, it is good fun for them. The reason why these successors are disappointing is that it is usually only for the children, it is the audience they are seeking, but it is more enjoyable when the jokes and history can be enjoyed by everyone. Now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but it was not so wise in my opinion to the first Swedish princess. I would recommend it to the little one, but if you're looking for a funny comic movie, I'd recommend staying with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
