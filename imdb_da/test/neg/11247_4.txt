The first movie was pretty hip and had entertaining moments, this movie doesn't have the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to keep her hair salon, but it is not only against the stylist Gina (Queen Latifah) with a beauty salon next door, but soon a large hairdressing chain called Nappy Cutz opens across the street. Calvin, along with colleagues and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), do everything they can to keep regular customers coming and ultimately their business runs counter to the competition. Also starts Michael Ealy like Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix like Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Bad Company's Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Loretta. I didn't like this movie as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about Eddie and it's not so witty, I just got sad. Okay!
