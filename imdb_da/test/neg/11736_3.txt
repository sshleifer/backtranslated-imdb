Norm (one) ally, I don't mind remakes. There are some really good ones out there, but this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically the scene of the scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction almost flawlessly, and the added color (I'm not one of those who thinks it must be B&W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie ... but it was the kitty-pee ca-caa! I don't understand how it could have been turned up so badly. If you should, see it as a curiosity, but I suggest you not bother.
