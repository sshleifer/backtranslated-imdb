While I watched and enjoyed similar films to this one, silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as. POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS, who shot the world, I did not really enjoy this. This was mostly due to the annoying and "artistic" way the director chose to shoot the film. While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style, this movie used similar techniques with much less finesse - in some places editing seemed very choppy and amateurish. Plus, and it was really annoying, and the use of zombies at the beginning of the movie and late in the movie was really over-the-top. What I mean by "zombies" is to illustrate how depressed and suppressed the Ukrainian peasants were, the people stand as mannequins in many scenes. And they stand like this, unmoving, for a very long time, while the "evil" capitalists and mass providers go by. Gimme a break! This movie is a wonderful example of style over fabric - and it's just a movie for those who enjoy or overlook the overindulgence. By the way, the DVD for this movie has improved, something if you leave the commentary on. This makes the film easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights.
