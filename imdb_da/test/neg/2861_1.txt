This really seemed to resemble the children's feature films except so much worse. A lawyer is trying to rescue a criminal who was convicted of killing his son from execution. She fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with her son and is immediately attached to it. So after more people are seriously injured, they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll who says she hasn't hurt anyone. Throughout this movie I found myself asking myself 'why do I look at this cheeze?' repeatedly. The end sucked so badly that I went and watched the Disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on.
