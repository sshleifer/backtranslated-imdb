It's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world who actually think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than tote a gun and knock evil guys. He moved quietly in the TV movie "Yes Virginia, There's a Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn director "The Indian Runner". In "The Evil That Men Do", however, Bronson again plays a character who sees injustice and puts it right with fists, knives and of course weapons. There is nothing here that you have not seen in the last five "Death Wish" flicks. <br /> <br /> Wait, I'll take it back. This should be the most sadistic and repellent violent movie that Bronson has ever been spoiled for being in. Not just repulsive in the torture sources or the descriptions of torture, but in the fact that these scenes were put in a movie just selling tickets. And Jose Ferrer! What in blue blazes did he do here? !! I mean, he won an Oscar, to cry aloud !!! <br /> <br /> Sorry about that outbreak. Let me just say that "The Evil That Men Do" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen based on a book. Yeah, that's right. I wonder if it was written with Bronson in mind? <br /> <br /> No stars. See "Death Wish" instead. At least that was the case.
