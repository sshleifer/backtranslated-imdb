I will praise it in only one respect. It was innovative. Innovative does not mean that it is a good movie, it means it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your own movies. <br /> <br /> The simple plot is .. well .. simple. I came to the point where I didn't care if they ruined the building or not. If I had to hear the girls' annoying giggle once again, I swear I'd turn off the DVD from the window. And there is also the main character. They're trying to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert! Sniffing the girls bra, creeping looking at her when she is naked, putting her bra over her eyes as he sleeps, puts his bra on a blown up scarf (as she takes panties while sleeping and slips them on his doll .. umm) What annoys myself moreso is the crazy toning. In the photo gallery on the DVD, you can see what the movie looked like before they shaded it and put in a color tone (also digitally). The film looked so much without the effect .. so they sacrificed it well. movies just to be artistic ... bah. I could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap .. I think most people who liked this movie just liked it because the chicken was naked for a good 5-10 minutes. This does not compare to delicacies (as so many are tryign). Delicacies have characters you can enter and suffer. These people here just shallow and giggle. Finally, I would also like to point out that it was also tryign to be like a German impressionist film old silent. One of the problems with most foreign, especially artistic, films is the thirty focus on making an artistic composition and forgetting the scene's 'space'. As a result, the audience does not really understand what is going on because they do not get a sense of the surroundings. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's nonsense. The short film on DVD, Surprise, was a heckuva much better.
