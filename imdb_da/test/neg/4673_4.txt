Half of the movie is flashing light and shaking camera. The rest consists of predictable characters (think science vs. government, "know-how" vs. authority, etc.) <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? Is it the cars that are thrown in the first 5 minutes, is the horrific 'Russian' accent of the cosmopolitan, are the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated Top 40 hits or "the US will save the world" vitriol? No. It is the fact that, regardless of the "sad" end - there is very little excitement in this movie - we basically know what to do. The one good part of this movie: "American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!"
