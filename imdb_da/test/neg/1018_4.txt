The DVD for this movie is by Alpha Video - a company that almost always publishes the poorest quality images. Alpha's defense is often the only print available, but specializes in public domain and cheap-o-movies. If you can find another print from another company, try it first, as printing for this movie is scratched and faded. But compared to most Alpha DVDs, this is unique - especially since the sound is quite clear (and Alpha never seems to contain closed captions - even with horrid sound movies). A man has dated a lady for a very long time. One night he is a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he comes to his fiancée for this, forgiving him, and they marry. <br /> <br /> Very soon after the wedding, he gets a huge call from the other woman - she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself. When they meet, he learns that she has a disease state and she wanted him to know that he could also get it now. So even though there is a nurse there and they treat her for the suicide attempt, she finds some kind of gun and kills herself! It makes a big mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he does not tell his new wife. Some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! At this point, the doctor meets with the guy and tells him the importance of getting treatment, and they show him rooms filled with horribly infected people (in fact, only movies of people with STDs that they spliced ​​into the movie - mostly of whom have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In some ways, the movie is very progressive. It solves a serious problem and it is interesting how the film encourages couples NOT to wait to get married but to marry quickly and give in to the sexual calls - but only with each other (not bad advice at all). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it is talking about. They never use the conditions STD, CEO or the like, nor are they called the diseases. It often refers to syphilis, but at other times it speaks of herpes or other STDs - the information is just not quite clear or specific - a very common problem with such films from this era. The audience at that time must have felt completely confused about what they saw, and many of the more naive would probably have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! <br /> <br /> In the 1930s and in the 1950s, many small and often worn production companies talked films about killing the dangers of drugs and sex (though they would often only promise to promise a bit of cheesecake to the audience who normally couldn't see such racy fare in Hollywood movies). Many of these are hysterical fun as they are so over-finished, and the information is so inaccurate. The best-known examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both of the same tobacco production company) and compared to how sparse and stupid the two films are, this cheap movie looks like it should be in the Criterion Collection !! <br /> <br /> It is interesting that there are nice things out there (I would definitely join them) who enjoy watching the movies because they are often so bad and so horrible that they are very funny . But one is not so bad, nor is the message that is fierce, and the victims' movies are not as big as some similar films. While the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 movie it is pretty good - despite the occasional bad play and the ridiculous suicide scene. Remember children - just say "No" to suicide! Oh, by the way, the two years of treatment they talk about in the movie was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. Today, it's much more treated - like the rest of the STDs.
