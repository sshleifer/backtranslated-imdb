Having just seen Acacia, I find that I agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this movie. Man, I was disappointed. When I looked at this, I thought "they probably just make me guard later", and for a while I expected something brilliant to happen. However, I slowly realized that the movie really is so bad. It's the cheapest cash into the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The basic story may not even be so bad, but the way it is filmed looks like the most ridiculous plot ever. The tree as a "scary" device can be okay if used smartly, but all the filmmaker does, gives us different images of ... yes, a tree, over and over again. He seems to hope that the tree will do everything for him in terms of excitement and construction, but it just feels like it is: shot of a tree. For the sake of goodness! Slow build-ups can be very effective, and a movie that presents the viewer with only a few glimpse of what's wrong can deliver good scares but not Acacia. Well, we get a glimpse of a child on a three-wheeled bike that disappears around the corner, and once again, meaningful shots of the tree from above or below or side, but these scenes are just not scary. They feel stupid, especially because you realize that the director means they are scary. They are simply not. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. Especially the one sign's 'descent into madness' is ridiculous. But what really breaks Acacia is the horrible editing. It's hard to see why scenes were cut together as they are, but it's bad, and it kills any spark of interest it might have had. It also makes me feel patronized, because I can see what they are trying to do with it, but I can't believe they think I would fall into such cheap ploys. There are lots of good Asian ghosts movies and many bad ones, but that's by far the worst thing I've seen. They must have gone through the list of 'what to put into ghost films' and crossed them all, but eventually they forgot to add the actual movie.
