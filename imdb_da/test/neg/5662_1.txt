iCarly is about a teenage girl named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, Spencer, in a Seattle ceiling. Carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes a lot of money a year, so much money she doesn't even know it's a real number. Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy), who is as predictable as they come! She says "normal" things and beats Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is responsible for all the technical stuff for their webshow. Carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have feelings. Sam chases Freddie around and Freddie screams. In an episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the doorman) in the elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it at all unless you like teenagers shouting, hurting people and making fun of things.
