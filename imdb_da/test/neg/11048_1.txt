I'm sorry to count on everyone's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly, I'm a beginner when it comes to South Korean cinema, but if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I'm not at all tuned when it comes to appreciating foreign films, and I don't fit the stereotype of the "stupid American". . . Well, not perfect. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the high praise, this is nothing encouraged. This is a disgusting * and * ridiculous movie. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. Terrible camera work, with an insistence on senseless close-ups derived from MTV aesthetics. <br /> <br /> The plot is more full of holes than a giant piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects a thriller to be 100% realistic and for the sake of entertainment I would be happy to close my eyes to small unsuitable details. But excuse me, what is happening here, which * can * stand itself in summary examination? This story of an incredibly complicated and fragile revenge act is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a supermarket line. (Do not want to spoil your "enjoyment" if it is the word, then will not go into details of the plot.) The fighting sequences are violent, incredible, even stupid (the main hero takes dozens and dozens of opponents at the same time after he only trained in prison, stopped a wall!) The really "excellent" features of this movie are two: the shabby and incestuous sex (brother of sister and father of daughter, we have developed since Oedipus, not us?) and the graphic violence. Cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - along with industrial amounts of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die to make the film?) Have no aesthetic function / motivation at all. <br /> <br /> A party for S&M tends to, but even to them, a party without profit or subtlety. The sky, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-debated work on an almost similar theme, was not so bad. <br /> <br /> The infinitely good press on this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore comes from Korean shores achieves doing I wonder what happens. I am not thinking of myself as the ultimate song of taste, and I am often ready to accept that a movie I did not like is better than I could experience. However, I have nothing scruples at all in calling this one as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming qualities. Min 2c? Find something better to do with your time.
