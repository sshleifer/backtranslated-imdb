When a friend and I saw this in recent releases, we decided to get it despite that none of us had heard of it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn, so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was really that bad. No actor or actress could have made this movie worth seeing. It was like taking the Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear weapons movies and trying to cut and paste it all together. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there were a few chuckles. I laughed when the main cabin boy asked Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he is any "pussy marine". The other laugh this movie got itself had nothing to do with the writing. I would very much love to know how the people who made this movie thought you could have a cruise ship beaten upside down and make it stay stable. It's not tipped or anything. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to watch for Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or any of the rest of this cast, continue. Find something good they did.
