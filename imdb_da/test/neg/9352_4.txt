Terrible Star Wars Banning with a little more cartoon. Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of pirates who steal ice, because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all the poor people live is a mystery). He is associated with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, about 25 years and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the cast there is a shameful appearance Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci-fi footage and a pudgy, short-ish Ron Perlman (who I thought was seven feet high from his other roles!). And John Carradine, who sees days of death and Hollywood Squares funnyman (relative term) Bruce Vilanch. If you'd ever see Bruce Vilanch be beheaded, here's your movie. But then again, even it's not worth seeing, as it doesn't close him at all (think he could have been a robot, but I nodded a few times).
