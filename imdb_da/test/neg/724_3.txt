This is one of four 1970s films by television writer Lane Slate about sensationalist murders in small towns. They have sympathetic television personalities such as police chief and distinctive characters as the city's regular guests, including light touch interests. The others are: They only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl In The Empty Tombs and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda is located near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); the others in California, Garner are by the sea ("Eden Landing") and Griffiths in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everyone tries to capture the feeling of a small town, moving at a leisurely pace among comfortable characters, and telling a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turning to it. At that level, they are somewhat entertaining (they often re-run themselves suggesting that they have some appeal). But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue, lax pacing, intense settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and off-putting, coercive attempts (often juvenile or raw) on color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda and Garner's are most serious about history, signs, pacing and tone. They have the best supporting casts, although Aldas is better utilized; Griffith throws pale in comparison. Alda has the best instructor. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" has some surprise and drama. The murderer's method is inventive. The tone is more smooth and the dialogue is more natural than in Griffiths. Aldas movie does not suffer from the others from smuggling city transplants to the city or from hokey, exaggerated local characters, both facing characters of a Hollywood screenwriter, not as real (the worst offender is the Griffith movie's pips quake that mumbles moron " Whit ", as we are told, tried to connect a jeep to and with a trailer that serves as a temporary bank, dragged the dock to the police, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck to get nothing for them, and filled in $ 11 on the withdrawal of "Spiro T. Babylis" only to be discovered by the counter). Mercifully absent is the clumsy, powerful repetitive-style dialogue of the Griffith movies ("Are you going to lunch?" "I take out the boat." "Do you want to take the boat for lunch?" "I I do not go for lunch." "You do not take the boat for lunch? "" There is no fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here? "" It is illegal in Horse Mountain. "" This is also where you break the law. "" Some law. not any fish in this lake. "" So why are you fishing here? "" I told you it's illegal in Horse Mountain. "" Call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. "" Okay, Lloyd ... " "Call me Lloyd, that's my name.") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low, key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a police officer for small times, certainly not a red hot lawman demanded by a rival city. Slate has the character admit so much when he arrives late for such an obvious clue as a result of an accidental naming. Instead of discovering or investigating, Barnes blindly hits emotionally denial. His secretary Lasser gives him a central track ("Why didn't I think about it," he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot control, leads to another gift indicator. Worse, Barnes is more interested in limiting the military officers of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than to lead them or his own men effectively. He allows a delayed murder by keeping incompetent a known goal. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly hit by the killer who flies a crime scene without pulling his gun or trying to take control. Again, he is ineffective and almost killed in the climatic scene, due to several errors on his part, which are only partially accidentally corrected. The erratic northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help credibility. <br /> <br /> There are plot holes. Why should the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace is unlikely. But they are nothing compared to the later - a couple together, a shopkeeper in his shop during opening hours, a fully dressed deputy sitting in his office and incredibly his dog! <br /> <br /> Alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate splashes into all the movies. Barnes comes first in a motel's bed. He treats her rudely in every trip and insults and tries to avoid her children. This, and the talk of the female doctor, turns off a raw, medieval pattern (Garner's films have been described as "creeping", including a scene where he and a substitute laugh at how a girl in the back seat of a car hit a bump In the road, part of her anatomy had bitten a guy in the car with her, Griffith's function is a ersatz ropers routine, where the woman scared trying to collect the man in the "utility cabinet", a free locker exchange of room type with a substitute to discussing a teen's car accident death ("did you take her out?" "I started her."); a reference to the banker "Bernice" as "swollen in places" and "sticking a pin in" her and hats and shooting the secretary " Maude "because she was" for the hair "; a description of the female doctors' practice as" two stirring tables and a flashlight "; a humiliating scene where Fran Ryan makes Griffith, offering" some home grown "and an abusive subplot where a woman , followed by a st Edge Play Ed as a drippy buffoon, seems to "sleep around"). Finally, Alda's film has a cloudy, bleached colorless, lifeless look. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least, the other movies had some spirit, scenery, and pleasant music; Griffith came out on the hillside, on the lake and even out into the big city. You want to see Masters or Empty Graves again than Shocking.
