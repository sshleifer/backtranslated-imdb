I was shocked to read all those wonderful comments about this movie because I hated it. I put it to the end, but it was painful - especially to listen to the child's voice. As Socact-1 noted, although the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she did not have a Chicago accent - it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a NY accent - but also failed. I was so confused that I was waiting for the punchline. Of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child, why did they choose it? And why force her to talk like that? It wasn't even the accent, it was the script, the monologue was created for her. The reason I chose this movie myself was that the plot idea appealed to me - this era in history, the type of characters that are poor and uneducated, the attitude - and the love triangle. As far as I'm concerned, it could have and should have been much better. I was just so happy to read that at least one other person felt the same as I did about this movie.
