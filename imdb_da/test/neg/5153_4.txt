I say one thing to Herman, USA: It will always play well for the Minnesota audience. I can't imagine there is another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's fixed life or a line like "I knew there was something wrong with Iowa guys" would bring the house down. I actually enjoyed the first hour or so. Basically, a bunch of lonely countries take boys a staff advertisement and find their city occupied with willing female suits (is it a gender-specific word?). It's not progressive, to be sure, but it's sorta charming in itself. Shame that the filmmakers felt they had to tackle a constructed subplot of a conniving gold digger and her violent man. All in all, it's just too cloying for his own good, but you have to give some props to a movie with the courage to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin's build a nude love scene. I will always welcome the portrayal of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual caring people, but that is not enough to redeem Herman, the United States. Rewriting Jello Biafra is the nostalgia for an age that never existed.
