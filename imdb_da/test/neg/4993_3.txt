The rise of the Undead begins as some huge core-type blast scratches through a named American city, a few people survive in a building by leaning on the door to shut it down and keep nastiness out (!). They argue among themselves for ages, then a monster comes from apparently nowhere and begins to kill them for one-on-one ... Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton & Shannon Hubbell one has to say that the Undead's rise is terrible. The script takes itself very seriously, but does not make sense, the first thing I asked myself was whether there is this huge core blow-off going on outside, destroying the whole city, why are these people I still see alive? Why is the building still standing? Then I asked myself when something would actually happen, the whole of the first 20 minutes put in one room, in fact it is a little generous, it's more of a corridor that the protagonist argues. Then it becomes part of the Return of the Living Dead (1985) rip-off with a government-created virus that makes people into zombies within one of the most sudden, pointless, and seemingly random plot twists I've ever witnessed that doing most of what has just happened a complete waste of time. So for the last 30 odd minutes, Rise of the Undead becomes something weird sci-fi type thing like something that looks like an energy lane floating around killing everyone, I was the only one asking what this floating energy ball is and where it came from? Come back to what happened outside of what was the cause again? Oh that's right, we're never told. The uprising in Undead is a mess, the character is horrible and is not even names, twisted about half way through will make you tear your hair into frustration, the dialogue sucks, nothing is explained, and there is almost no history here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) of Rise of the Undead has no dialogue at all, and the movie just ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Of course, the director's Horton & Hubbell worked on a low budget, the whole movie set in about two rooms and three corridors! The shooting is horrible, they use annoying color filters seemingly random and sometimes it looks like Rise of the Undead was shot on a camcorder. There are no special effects, there is some false blood sprayed around, but no actual make-up effects to speak of. There are some CGI shots of the city that are engulfed in flames, which looks great, but the liquid ball of the energy being seems to be terrible. There is an enchanting shot early where two people are sitting against a corridor wall and talking, for some bizarre reason is the head cut off at the top of the screen! Only their lower bodies from the neck down are seen yet nothing else happens in the frame, they do not move and there is no one else there, but for some strange reason their heads are cut out of the top of the frame while they are talking to each other! It is quite a strange thing to see actually. <br /> <br /> With an ultra low budget of about $ 10,000 and according to the IMDb shot in two weeks, I must congratulate the decision makers for getting Rise of the Undead finished and distributed, but this is where my congratulations stop because otherwise this has horrible production values ​​and set in about three corridors located somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, as is where Rise of the Undead was shot. The play sucks, so I will not dwell on it. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Undead sucks, it sounds like a zombie movie, but honestly it is not, whether it's under par and I know the filmmakers were working on a low budget, but that's not really an excuse for me. Definitely not recommended.
