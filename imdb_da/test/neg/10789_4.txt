I must admit that I have a disadvantage here; When I learn more about a movie from other reviewers than from seeing it myself, it is a problem. While the plot "The Man Who Went Too Much" seems generally straightforward, the film allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what might have been a satisfying mystery. When we get to the scene where a wicked-looking woman establishes the secret of "the first degree of the sevenfold ray", I didn't know if I should laugh or rewind to see if I was missing something. <br /> <In retrospect, the cryptic note retrieved by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a shaving brush, a handwritten message leading to a dentist named Barbor and finally to Albert Hall, a place not a person as indicated by "A. Hall". But for the whole plot it is never clear why the murder was eliminated. Okay, so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew about a plot to murder a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Come to think of it, why was the note itself written and secured in the shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it now and then to remind himself of what would happen? <br /> <br /> With its inconsistent scenes, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is hard to follow and a little disorienting, but I give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early effort. For perspective, I see some of his other works of the same era, although this film certainly cannot hold a light to his later works as "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
