Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of the comics (but if the comics are of the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but it must be one of the worst movies ever made. Non-existent plot, ridiculous action, stupid dialogue ... This movie is so bad that it hurts. A lot. That some people actually gave this 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least poor) movie. If you hate yourself, see Tank Girl! On another thought, if you hate yourself so much, you may just have to commit suicide ... My rating: -34/10
