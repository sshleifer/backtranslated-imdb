History of the creation of Underdog and adventure fights Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format. First we have Showshine taken out of the street and taken to a science experiment laboratory where Simon Bar Sinister works. He struggles back when Sinister tries to inject him with a chemical, and accidents occur, he gets superpowers and the lab pops up with hurting Sinister. On the street, Shoeshine runs by Riff Raff, another dog, and is picked up by Jim Belushi, who was vigilant at the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes the Underdog, who in turn will beat Sinister. <br /> <br /> When you decided that the dog should be a real dog, you have some kind of limitation on whether or not the movie should work. For me, the movie does not work half and half. The part that is not, are all the things where you see Shoeshine, the dog, like a dog with his master. Some of the repartee are fun, but it just pulls again and again when we are introduced to Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do. Its a fatal 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the movie. It is painfully boring and feels like it takes forever to get through what the film is saying 75 minutes of sans credits is something you will not do. <br /> <br /> The good parts are something with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is a blast) and everything underdog goes into action. Some how somehow they managed to find a way to be both twisted to the spirit of the theater and to update it. Of course, I could be wrong, as the middle section is so boring, but I don't think when I'm looking to catch the end of this again on cable. As a whole, it's probably as terrible as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble upon the good parts, this is an okay comic book movie. (But wait for cable really)
