This movie was just so awful that I couldn't get through the whole thing without turning it off, it was just so bad! When I looked at it, I thought that it looked like a really cheap movie made back in the 60s or something with the horrible looks, but then I realized that this was just made in 2001. <br /> <br / > Dialogue and play were really terrible and the plot was almost non-existent. I didn't think anyone would go back to making movies that look so cheap and old, I'm not sure they did it on purpose, or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie at all. It really looks like it was shot on someone's video camera at a local person's house or something. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it just comes out and looks really cheesy. <br /> <br /> I really don't know how anyone ever liked to see this. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 * s.
