You know the story of "Sweeney Todd" now, probably thanks to Tim Burton's latest movie. You probably don't know, even if you take the old story from Andy Milligan up - the infamous sleaze merchant who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. happen in the end. In my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60s to the 80s, I finally go through an Andy Milligan movie. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us a lot of exploitation and horror movies - none of which was anything good and hardly visible. "The bloodthirsty butchers" are no exception. There is dialogue and good talk, and it is one of the things you find here - lots and lots of talk. The movie sometimes reaches almost "Manos The Hands of Fate" levels that you wait tirelessly for something to happen. While I love cheap looks, the violence is too few and far between, and despite that reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love cheap and sleazy utilization just as much as the next rubbish game, but "Blood-Dry Butchers" is the kind of bad thing that MST3K would tear each other without problems. Unfortunately, Milligan would die of AIDS in 1991, and if there is any film of his, I would say I liked it, it would be the scary "The Ghastly Ones". However, it's not "Ghastly Ones" - it's just bad.
