What on earth! This game gambling movie theater would have been suitable for the Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his depiction as "Stu" was short. The fittings were unbearable and too many. Support cast, where are you? Anyone who did the molding should be partially guilty. The kinematics were useless. A gambling story with an after school feel it. Stories of this kind should be left to Oliver Stone's of the World. It would still suck ass, but at least it would be fun to see. It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race ever began. Mario Andretti in 1982 Indy 500 came to mind.
