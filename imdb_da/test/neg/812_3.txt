Outside Sweden you are not expected to have seen this movie. Happy you. The game features several actors who are important in modern Swedish film history. And still .. <br /> <br /> It looks as if Peter Dalle had only one idea that lasted for approx. 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally abused in this film and tries to copy a younger GÃ¶sta Ekman. Ekman, by the way, is the only actor who meets expectations. <br /> <br /> Credit that can be given is for the picture, great idea by using black and white. Music is ok. <br /> <br /> But everywhere there is a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.
