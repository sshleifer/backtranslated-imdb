According to most people, I know that watching this movie, and for the reviews I've read, should be a very entertaining thriller that oh must be seen by more people. I didn't think this movie would blow me away, but I certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre at best, which is what it is. <br /> <br /> I am no stranger to the fact that French films are both French and have studied them as students, so I am aware of clich√©s and corny plot terms that can go unnoticed by the English / American audience. There are some beautiful French films that should have gained widespread international release, but that is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The beginning is both far-fetched, over complicated and too intelligent to be entertaining so you really feel every minute of its 2-hour and 5-minute running time, and when everything is finally revealed, you are without care. The protagonist himself lacks any real charisma or even merchanting talent to keep your attention directed mainly at him and his journey anytime close to the crap so by the time you have yourself considered swallowing the main plot twists it has begun to dawn on you have wasted your time! In fact, I remember turning off before the credits actually began rolling after the movie's climax - that was the point where I was sure I was almost completely wasting my time by the way. <br /> <br /> The movie is not on all the worst things I've seen, but it seems totally overstated. For example, I read somewhere that it beats all Bourne Identity movies in the form of excitement or even that it has 'wall-to-wall excitement'. I can safely say that some people hang out on this frankly boring movie. 4/10 is a generously thoughtful review for this movie I feel, and since I have seen some complete and complete stinkers, I will scare them 1s, 2s and 3s for them.
