My general feeling of this movie is that it was a slow, drawn-out, structurally wandering through some of the world's really unfortunate situations with a bit of redemption and a clear message. The movie consists mainly of rather unattractive video footage of the countries he visits with bad reenactments, all slowly down to a snail's pace and overlaid with depressing music. Certainly some of the materials and interviews contain some compelling stories, but contrary to what the description at the back suggests, it was not so much the victim's story being told as it is the director's Mr Ripper, and he does not tell it well. This movie could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, so they tell their stories. Instead, Mr Ripper draws the story on himself and makes it a kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it is not a big part of it. I never really have any sense of growth as he explores the subject, and he never states what the subject did to him at first. He draws us from one place to the next, brushes easily on the situation and signs, hangs around and shows too much unnoticed slow motion footage of people just walking around the streets and moving on to their next destination. He does this over and over, and again without any real development. I felt that this movie could have been cut down to 45 minutes, but it pulled out to close to 2 crushingly slow hours. We feel morally obliged to worry about the subject, but the director's self-giving, chronic, uninspired delivery of his journey makes you numb after a while.
