The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like screaming and I know what you did last summer, this movie is aware of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on these conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just boring. The reason is your basic Ten Little Indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters is hit until only the hero (ine) is left to defeat evil. And that's exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tensions. Production values ​​and performances were ok, but I had no motivation to look to the end (though I did) because I already knew how the end scene would play out. The end surprised me a bit because it managed to fizzle out, literally, instead of throwing a forest with special effects. Perhaps the special efficiency budget was spent at the end.
