OK, this movie seems to be pretty well covered by previous comments, but there are a few things I want to add. The mad scientist produces a serum from the blood of a cage animal to make a man a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy in, that's fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. It would make a varcoyote. In 1942, did the audience not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to tell from each other. It's weak. <br /> <br /> Second, this movie was covered in the third episode of MST3k (on the comedy channel). It took Joel and bots a number of episodes to come up to full riffing steam, and they weren't up there yet on this one. They added enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end, but it wasn't one of their better episodes. They did not even mention the sharp omission of an actual wolf, and it was just in the air waiting to be tasted.
