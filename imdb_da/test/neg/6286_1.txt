Wow ... Reading through these comments I see a remarkable socio-cultural collision issue that arises between the US and ... Dutch! US P.o.V. seems to be this very good little movie, Parker is a sympathetic hero, the story a light hearted representation of what could be a glorified form of reality. All three Dutch reviewers see the world through a completely different pair of glasses it seems. They are categorically and surprisingly uniform agreements that the movie is a disaster. It is far from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, at this point as far apart as the sea separates them geographically. Still based on actual observation - I saw the film with my own eyes - I suppose the Dutch are not too far away from the selection: "Parker Kane" is poorly made, quite boring and really not worth celluloid, which was undoubtedly wasted in its creation.
