... If you have chained too much for a long time and you have to take a break. After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, I decided to turn it on and check it out for myself. Everything that each of these people has said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half hour version of Mad TV, but somehow worse jokes. One bad thing I was dissatisfied with seeing was "The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics". What is fun about black guy who has difficulty swimming, or gay guy called "Sparkles" who wins a banana competition? None of these concepts is especially novel, insight or entertaining. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every episode? That movie came out as 30 years ago. Mencia's fun stuff solution goes into some Hispanics stereotypes and throws a few "prayers" in there; And call it a day to go home to roll around in its pile of money. Pure comedian genius. <br /> <br /> Then he blatantly beat Jeff Foxworthy on another show I watched, "with your gay if ..." bit. You can just imagine the roaring laughter he got when sneaking in a Ryan-Seacrest ice-gay joke. It is not as if any of them have already been killed. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer movies, stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle out there who can joke about race and racism and still be insightful.
