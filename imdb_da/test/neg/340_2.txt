Even with the low budget, this movie could have been worth seeing if there was a story to tell here. It started pretty well and relatively engaging and credible. The actors and figures were interesting, although there was not much character development. My favorite scene was when they all ate their rations. Some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it wasn't that bad. The story starts very airtight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then it dipped into a little scare which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the puzzles. No real credible end game for the villain? No real explanation for what is going on. Generally, if a movie is to use the F-word for every other word, it is usually also spiraled from there. I still get offended believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to do bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe of great good stories out there? People don't feel they are wasting their time, and everyone else is when they put things out like this. Why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? No women actors / characters either? Not anyone at all? This had the option of being another "Predator" but unfortunately far far short fell. <br /> <br /> My last comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My advice for low-cost movie production companies out there. Make sure you have a good story before you start and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than anything that looks fake or ridiculously unclear.
