Why is it nothing but Ator playing fun of Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly, I had the accident sitting through this turkey before the Mystery Science Theater 3000 tore it apart. I highly recommend checking out the MST3K version as it is fun and one of their best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> The movie on its own is basically the kind of typical B movie crud that Italian filmmakers launched in the early to mid-80s. This movie was apparently made into cash in Conan craze, but it fails unlucky on all counts. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the scenes where Ator fights a giant rubber hose and also manages to make a complete hang glider during a cut. <br /> <br /> "Thong, fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> Rating: The movie-1 MST3K version: 10
