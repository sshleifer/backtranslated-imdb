This line is a good summary of this movie. If you've read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you'll know exactly how the rest of the movie should behave. Some researchers named Surgei (SirGay said) are searching for hell in the underworld in Moscow. But he seems to have disappeared and his friend Oven comes with a team to search for him. Could they find a more boring card? Some bad actors look for an old man in the underground. The action is very bad, the romance really feels meaningless and untrue, often there is no good reason for how the characters work, nothing is scary and most of all: nothing interesting happens throughout the film. They just go and ask some gang leaders and other guys about the road, go a little more, complain some, find the old man, and then they run and finally find the way out of the underground. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me the least of all ratings is the atmosphere. If you just want to watch a movie for it, it might be a good choice. It is dark and it is mysterious and obscure. But the rest of the movie is really boring. You're sitting right there all the time waiting for the movie to start or something to happen. In fact, some things happen, but they are not really well done. For example, I didn't really notice when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I didn't sleep or anything. And I don't understand what's dangerous with these kids ... They just run around in the underground and scrape it with walls (I suppose it's supposed to be scary in some way). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you are in immediate use of some creepy atmospheres.
