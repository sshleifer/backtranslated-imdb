I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I hoped it would end. <br /> <br /> It had a promising start; the first 10 minutes. The prerequisite for this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after spending days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) is just not credible. He kisses her somewhere along the way and she feels Ohh so horrible about it. <br /> <br /> Very little substance to grab your interest. The action just doesn't stop. He is very passive. No matter how much of the movie is shown, the viewer never develops any kind of caring connection with the characters on the screen. You learn that her next expression will be as boring as her previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", He doesn't smoke, he wants her to stop smoking. She doesn't have this now.) <br /> <br /> She calls him in the middle of the night to visit him After one year's absence, she enters through the door, they neither hug nor kiss or express any kind of emotional connection. He doesn't even lean forward to lift his suitcase to help her in. It's not how real people behave. This is not how best friends behave. <br /> <br /> When he receives his phone call in the middle of the night (she is in town for a day), he shows little interest in seeing her face, seems more like she will be a burden for the night. At this time they have known each other for two years and he has not seen her for a year. Not credible, not really. He has reportedly written a book on Entropy and Enthalpy, but we never see him writing or reading or discussing any of his interests in physics with her, not that she would be able to handle the discussion. We learn that a watermelon in L.A costs $ 50 (it was not Silicon Type mind you) he has no problem giving it fruit. We also learn that the airport shuts down when a couple of really really fake snow flakes fall off the sky. I'm sorry, but it was also in L.A. <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them fighting, they are always on holiday. They have infinite time, they have no worries at all. <br /> <br /> Nice life. Unreal life. Unreal signs. Bad section. Bad movie.
