We are in the not too distant future, globalization seems to have reached a peak, language mixes with each other (although English rules over the rest), races have merged, human cloning is a fact, and the whole territory seems to have been divided into two zones : the one for the valid one and the one for the non-valid ... a brave new world (in Aldous Huxley's style) where people are genetically archived and blood relations are strictly prohibited (for health reasons it is the code 46 in the title) . In such an environment are two souls who are destined not to fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom had an important story with great potential. A nice recipe that he destroys, gives it such a slow rhythm, it tells in such a tired way, removes emotions ... Coldness, that's all code 46 transfers. Coldness and boredom. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play their roles wonderfully) and the visual and acoustic effect of some sequences cannot do anything to save the movie. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: What could have been and never was. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
