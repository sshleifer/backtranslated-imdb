First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was fascinated and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so on. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I just regret how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothing ... now vampires seem to be besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty people. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were neat ... everything with human nobles was interesting. Pity the play was unpleasant. It was also possible for the slave. <br /> <br /> Other things struck me equally pathetically. Spoilers now. Casting walls that can be skipped in a few steps? Enemies who do not attack by day Big bad old vampires who take ages to participate in battle and then run away from a bubbly lycan looking for a minute or so? Were there close to their enemies? Lycans who raid arsenals ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or armor! A vampire leader so unlucky does he manage to have almost everyone against him? The romance is so convincing that it is sad. <br /> <br /> So I do not recommend this movie unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie image. Some of the action is good for OK. The vampires armor and weapons are certainly interesting. Otherwise, a very weak script that is poorly composed and uses all sorts of inane plot twists.
