This episode sucks. In recent years, I've seen all episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and now look at "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I'm thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It's more like an attempt at slapstick. <br /> <br /> It doesn't build the signs, but throws them on a limb - leaving the audience gasping. It doesn't matter to build the series. <br /> <br /> Why was this allowed to go in the air, wondering. Was that the writing? Was that the management? Was it the producer? We probably never know. <br /> <br /> But a bad apple is not bad, I suppose. I say hope is just one.
