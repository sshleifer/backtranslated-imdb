Let me start by saying that this restored version of one of the greatest ever created films "Psycho" (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction, bad action and bad cast. The best way to describe this movie is to compare it step by step, acting and acting on process to the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest film directors ever lived, intended to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrific scenes as much as we are today, but it did not prevent people from suffering it and were nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. What should have looked realistic in color did not. After the shower Norman washes his hands, it is easily understandable that what was used for blood resembled some kind of red wax. When he washes out of his blood, his hand has red color. <br /> <br /> On acting, it might not have been a better cast by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins fits well with Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. Hitch wanted a beautiful and good actor and it worked fine. In this version, I personally think that Vince Vaughn looked perfect and beautiful and strong to play Norman's role, unfortunately his action was nothing but terrible. In the motel office, where Norman and Marion have the long conversation, he had zero expression on his face, and his voice and face never change all the way through. In the original on the same scene, when madhouse is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expansion on Perkin's face, and he looks frighteningly sour, even though it is not aggressive. Vince Vaughn works here the entire conversation as if he had just had his lines of heart. Again, horrible plays. The same is with Anne Heche. In the opening scene of the original we can see how excited and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she drives to Phoenix. She was happy to get the money, but at the same time afraid of life. That's what I call acting. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles regularly to get the money. I don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they just stole $ 400,000 and the entire state police are behind them. In the shower, Janet handles the curtain in the original, turns around and dies after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stung, turned and swings the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. Again, horrible action. <br /> <br /> There are also some specially introduced changes to this movie from the original that apparently have nothing to do with the plot line and the current situation. In the scene where Arbogast is murdered, two scenes flash between the pins. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including myself, are not quite sure if the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or what it was. What on earth does an animal or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also a few changes at the end stage. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and only) positive points along with it. I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character of Lila. And William Macy worked well, it was almost as if Arbogast's character should have been played. <br /> <br /> It is common knowledge that the purpose of a movie reaction is to make the current generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line and to try to make it look better than original. And if something has happened here, as I have just said, it is directly the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me are not impressed after seeing this movie unless we come to know about the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, it is not near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies, if not the best.
