This should be stated in "Bible Belt" in Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there and was a child of the era depicted in the movie, it just wasn't right! The centers were everywhere - anything but County Antrim / Derry. The church didn't look like anything I've ever seen. "The Church of God" is a girl's cello, but the one in the movie was definitely not pentecostal! The older minister was initially dressed in the Irish Church (Anglican) - and no C. or I. would call himself "the Church of God". The minister was often treated as "reverent" - they can do it in some parts of the world, but I have never heard it when I lived in this area. The ministers were treated as "Mr ......" <br /> <br /> This movie was very poorly researched and thrown - quite typical of Irish movies - annoying! A movie can have a good plot, but if it doesn't look authentic, it's a nonsense.
