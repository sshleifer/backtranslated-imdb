Besides the fact that this guy is a liar, he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once when I tried to see this excuse for a TV show, I think I actually threw up my mouth a little. I don't mind feeling a little stupid every time I see one of his horrible advertisements while enjoying great comedy programs like the Reno 911 and the American Body Shop. It shows like this that makes me worried about humanity's continued existence. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can make someone look like a moron. Please start asking now that the comedy center will realize their mistakes and complete this show as soon as possible. Don't we have enough?
