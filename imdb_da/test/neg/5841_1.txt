It was clear that a number of agents could not ignore dollar signs when they signed up for their 117-minute * omage * to the courtesan complex. Of course, the movie could have been okay, had $ 1 million been left out. Seriously. The number of the check doesn't matter, prostitution is still prostitution, and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no law of marriage should ever mean "too richer for the poorer, to pimping as in fidelity". Picture the story otherwise, though: 2 children, flat soft, the border "desperate" and completely silly. They collide with wealthy businessman. The children's marriage is tense by imperfect times and the fact that the man is something of a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, oozing charm and stability - a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock - and with him the wife's temptation, tension, excitement. Who will she choose? Perhaps, under these conditions, I could actually care. Honestly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy wins the sympathetic character. A woman who wants to sell herself is just about what a guy deserves to pimp out his wife. The obscene proposition makes the man a total loser, deficient in every positive male characteristic, and makes the wife a cheap trumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman without a moral center and self-respect. <br /> <br /> All that impressive talent (acting, director, filmography) wasted on this movie - and it was an impressive amount - couldn't save it from its splashy-but-for-trashy $ 1 million pitch line. If I see this turkey on another bridal shower, I'll fry it! (Or maybe cross it with the Titanic and put the tape in the sea!)
