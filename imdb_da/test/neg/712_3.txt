Published at a time when Duvivier went again from strength to strength. "Black Jack", which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary Au Royaume des Cieux and the dazzling "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", is a jumble that the Duvivier itself hated, which is not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this dud.We can notice: 1.Orson Welles used to admire the Duvivier. It may explain why wellesian actors were highlighted in Duvivier's film: Joseph Cotten in "Lydia" (1941), and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead. It's the first time <br /> <br /> I haven't enjoyed Moorehead's performance! On the other hand, Welles lent his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier's "Au Royaume des Cieux" to his "Othello". <br /> <br /> 2.In any Duvivier movie there are one or two valuable sequences, and this is no exception: the quest in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short time), so chase reaches Dalio gets caught in the fishnets.Duvivier's touch can also be felt in the unhappy end. <br /> <br /> As for the rest, as my dear friend of the author writes, it's a black joke.
