In the twilight of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-term partnerships with several directors, especially J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also made two films for one-time Bond director Peter Hunt - the first being the decent 1981 actor Death Hunt, the other being this indifferent political chase thriller. Murder is pretty dull if truth is known, and in the end you will long for something with a little more passion and pace, such as. The Wilby Conspiracy (as in drawing, this movie is similar). <br /> <Bronson Sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose mission is to protect the American president's wife, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, Bronze's real wife). Killian believes Mrs Craig has been brought by assassins; She thinks he's an over-protective, paranoid pessimist. Stands Out - Surprise Surprise - Killian was right all the time, and somebody is out to kill her. The couple go on the move, which is being pursued by the assailants. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that a US President's wife is known as The First Lady. For some reason, in this movie, they have renamed her "One Mama"! Whatever this is, anyone is guessing, but it is a sign of the movie's meaninglessness as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy, and the manuscript takes a long time to get to where it goes. If I were to feel murder in a particular genre, I would say it was a "thriller". I will say this with some reservations, like saying it's a thriller, it has precious few tensions.
