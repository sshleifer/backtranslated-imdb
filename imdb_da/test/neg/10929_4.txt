This is a rather simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the excellent ingredient of this recipe that delivers a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic achievement deserving an Oscar nom. Just as nice is the special effects of the air fight. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned their territory into a British air squadron during WWI. She is the "regiment's daughter", loved as a little sister. In this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper. Initially, they hate each other so they love each other, so the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission. Cooper returns, but crashes into the village and a red cross unit removes him. Moore looks for him, is told in a hospital he is dead, then walks the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they reunite. <br /> <br /> It's a nice little romance, but hardly more than that. Recommended for fans of Mrs Moore and Mr. Cooper
