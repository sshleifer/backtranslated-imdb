Even before this movie, it is clear to see that Ali G has become the exact character he set for parody. I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Coh's character anyway, but was curious to see how a man with so little talent was able to convince universal studies to fund a movie of nearly 1 and a half hours out of a 3 minute joke. <br /> <br /> A paper-thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes, and I have to admit that I was joking when I saw such respected thespians as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon bowed so low for employment. Saying that I must admit (though I am ashamed) that I was traveling over more than one occasion and how bad this movie was, it was never boring, and never once did I consider turning it off (mainly because of the beautiful Rhona Mitra). To say that only watch this movie if you are a teenage boy aged 14-17 and you find dick jokes fun.
