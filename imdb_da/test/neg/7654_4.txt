(May contain spoilers) This movie is the epitome of fright. I rented it and hoped for a movie so bad it would be fun. However, I still can't quite decide whether this movie should be scary or humorous. It combines emotions in a rather disturbing way. Apparently, this is trying to be wise, but in reality it is not. For example, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it begins to play good music. When we go to Toxico, we have up-beat, quasi-Mr. Rogers neighborhood music. But when the little child dreams of falling into "blood" and when he finds the leg, it is clear that they are tense. Then watch this movie and decide for yourself. It's too strange to be described in words and for that I say, kudos. <br /> <br /> "Teddy Bear ... WOW!"
