Well, Killshot is not terrible, but it comes close. The production values ​​are decent and the main players do a pretty good job (except for Rosario Dawson in a wasted role), but the story is just pathetic. I don't know if the Elmore Leonard book had such stupid characters since I didn't read it, but I guess the book should be at least a little humorous. The film has no demonstrable humor. After the first twenty minutes you have to shout at the screen: "Oh, come on! No one is so stupid !!" In a nutshell and without any spoilers, everyone acts in a way that is convenient to the plot, yet it doesn't make sense. A very frustrating and unrealistic film that can take the form of sitting on the shelf as long as it did.
