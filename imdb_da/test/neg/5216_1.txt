This is another of the fundamentalist Christian films that hit you over the head with religion as a sledgehammer. You know you're in trouble when setting up the story is completely ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico to deliver Bibles. It makes no sense since the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. The Catholic Bible has books in it that are not in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico would not distribute Bibles to them. I can understand if they were going to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is far fetched. If you can't believe in the setup of a story, then you don't do the rest of the story either. A movie about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.
