As for Asian horrors, I have seen my share of disappointments with some of the horrific things that can be imagined ... "Acacia" does not really qualify for any of these categories. It had a few moments of excitement and was interesting to see, but I couldn't help believing that there should have been a bit more to this story. The film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a child who seems to have a fascination with trees. He develops a bond with the Acacia tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it. Then he storms into a fight with his mother, involving their newborn child, after threatening to find his dead mother, now a tree. When he does not return, the parents send the file a report and wait, while the neighbor girl thinks he somehow resides in the Acacia tree. The pacing is quite slow, and the end becomes a little strange, but I have to recommend it as a somewhat enjoyable effort, even though the story feels a little flat. Hell, I can't really make that point on this ...
