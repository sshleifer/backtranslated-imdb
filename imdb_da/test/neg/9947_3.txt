Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as supposed flushing beach student Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a geek who just came to the beach hoping to honor his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surf haninks. Guy's cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk will watch surfing documentaries with the entire city of LA on a Friday night. Duke takes in the nephew and tries to teach him how to play volleyball is like touching a woman. Next time my wife speaks back, I will pretend that I am spiking the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the movie turns into a good drama, as the first half of the movie didn't really make sense. Duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball, the best he has played for over ten years. The way the scene is shot is beautiful. You can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach. The five minutes will go down as one of my favorites all the time. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was lamb.
