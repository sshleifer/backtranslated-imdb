I have to say this is the first movie I go through here, I haven't finished watching. I mean .. I can't go on! No matter how adamant I am to see things to the bitter end, "The Ballad Of The Sad Caf√©" showed no match to this viewer. Vanessa Redgrave is the star of the strange woman in town who does things like walking through the river with a complete set of clothes. Anyways. A long lost relative is going to visit, he's a midget and well, it's as far as I got. What was the meaning of all this? I didn't even disturb waiting for Michael Carradine to come on, as I was already pummeled meaningless by the combination of the slow script AND having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role. I call this coffee table cinema. of the cinema that appeals to just a few of you, but the others just go away.
