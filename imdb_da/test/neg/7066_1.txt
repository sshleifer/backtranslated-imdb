I've had this movie, in the back of my head feeling I saw it. I have wanted to tell people about it over and over, but never remembered. now I found it. Now finally I can tell people exactly what the absolutely worst and most crappy movie I've ever seen in my life, bar is none. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete waste and is unsuitable for a garbage waste. All prints and other copies of this film must be rounded up in a large rocket and launched in the sun. Only the purifying heat and pressure of the sun can be able to clean the materials on which this film is stored so that they can be useful to the universe again. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. And yes it is an opinion. but this movie was pure waste, dirt and excrement of any animal that should never be seen even by man. I'd rather see a Uwe Boll Movie marathon than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll's movie.
