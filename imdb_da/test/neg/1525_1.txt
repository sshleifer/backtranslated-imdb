Does anyone disturb anyone where this kind of sludge comes from before they blow on their supposed revelations? Ask yourself a question: Is my skull an open bucket that I allow anyone to dump their propaganda into? Do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomber's mentality at pathtofreedom.com before wasting your time with this peel. These kind of Mother Earth / Peoples Berkeley urbanite fruit cakes openly despise a lifestyle simply because it does not fit theirs must believe that their case fails in fact and objectivity. Otherwise, why encourage intentional distortion and overt unilaterality? Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Don't be a juice. Take two seconds and watch a skeptical eye before you fall into yet another "end of the world" hysteria from the take-a-village types with a political agenda that is likely to be left to yourself. Mi. Moore (rather his unthinking followers) has really opened floodgates with this kind of unilateral political garbage going out like a * cough * documentary. But apparently they understand the feeling of a stubborn audience: "If it's on a movie screen, it must be true." <br /> <br /> God gave you a brain - act as if you know what to do with it ...
