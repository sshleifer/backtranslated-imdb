First of all, Katherine Hepburn is very miscast as Clara. She just can't be convincing as the devoted, selfless, rather smarmy wife the writers have created. <br /> <br /> But the real weakness of the movie is its superficiality in the face of a potentially large piece of drama. Schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder is "Oh, oh, I have a headache" and the occasional evil word. Suicide? The word is used, but there is no sign of it in domestic scenes, and when we see him in the mental hospital, he is calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic. A superficial treatment. And Brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his gruff humor, his love of adapting the institution's noses, no sign of his tortured attitude towards sex and women as a result of using his youth to play pianos in brothels. And was Charles's long concert career entirely promoting Robert's music, or was she really a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself, a female pianist cutting out a place for herself in a male world? Any kind of treatment of great artists' lives is better than none, but it is a standard Hollywood road, especially disappointing, because the real story is so much more dramatic, so much more interesting, so much more human.
