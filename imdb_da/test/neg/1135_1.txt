This movie was horrible. It's too much about Eddie, Clark Griswald's sister-in-law. Eddie seems much better when he changes good quips as in "Christmas Vacation" and "Vacation". I really don't understand how a movie like this would be thumbs up. Don't make me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but just felt that this movie was completely wrong for him and for the character in general. This movie leaves much to be desired and really needs some major name actors.
