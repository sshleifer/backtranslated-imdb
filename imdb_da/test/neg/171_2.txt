Oh God! It could be a very interesting movie and actually it is. I would like to give it a 5, but I give a 2 to my vote. Why? I saw it in a theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! The recording is really really bad !!!!! It continues to shake constantly, in a completely tasteless setting! Watching this very interesting movie in a movie theater is really painful. You quickly became seasick and you have to make a lot of great effort not to hit your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's really a shame, but the story has been edited in a nonlinear way, which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Watch this at home!
