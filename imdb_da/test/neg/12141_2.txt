I grew up seeing the "Bowery Boys" on the weekends, and even at an age I could tell this was low-rent stuff as the name suggests. Still, it was fun to see Satch (Hall) get better with Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs had made the mistake of him. East Side Kids stuff was never shown, although it was public area stuff and probably cheap to drive, it was just making a standard for kids to tune in, even though we only had as 5 channels to watch. Enter year 2005 and I repossesin about my childhood. I can't find any Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found The East Side Kids on disk and also on a public site. Luckily I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz online for free and it really blows. Now I see that there are some Bowery Boys and maybe Monogram bad movie lovers here who gave this melodrama crap a 7 out of 10 but c'mon people, this is not even trying to be fun. It's an East Side Kids drama, not a comedy, so it's not good. The best part was seeing Mugg's fight at the end, he reminded me of my class school days flayling away as a girl when I was going to come in a fight, it was a bit abusive. Leonard Maltin said in his mini cinema that this flick is one of the better ones, so you can just imagine the rest. If you want to see some half-way decent East Side actions, maybe Ghosts on the Loose may be, but the bottom line is usually a comedy team that starts out strongly in their career and turns off. These mugs blew chucks early and then slowly picked it up until Hall's antics dominated than they were at best. Still 2. things far below the 3 stooges, who they imitate but fun for those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring back cozy "Bowery Boys" memories and is best back to Monogram fanatics.
