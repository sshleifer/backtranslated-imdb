OK, this movie was the worst view I've seen this year. The actors were not bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they made b-movie plays). Anyways, I watched this movie, think, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message on people. The last scene was extremely messy. It's a horrible thing to do for a person to make them believe in something. What anyone believes in is a matter of meaning. This film just shows how ruined religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a b movie, it's not. If you want to watch a movie trying to brainwash the masses. Well that's the choice of the litter. go straight for it. If you need to convey a message, do it, do not force it. Ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such an extent. Especially Christians.
