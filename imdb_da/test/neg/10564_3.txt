OK, when I say "wow", I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The film is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blows people into oblivion. BEWARE!!! And so I mean, take care of the special effects. There are a great number of errors. The act is horrible, but I would say that the only one who makes any effort would be the Sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and badly lit. On a particular scene, it's day outside, and then the shot Night Beast shows to shoot his gun with the night behind. Then show it again. * Shakes head * I usually like low budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to finish it because I never see a movie without ending it. The only achievement this film achieved was a stranger who was not stereotypical. So for that, and only for that ... I give it a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day. You get even more depressed by the failed attempt this movie makes.
