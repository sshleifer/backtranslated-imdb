I was surprised to see this piece of shit if you saw an episode of TOM and JERRY where Jerry bothered to liquid him and become invisible than you would probably see the same cartoons with added EROTIC topping a man invisible and doing S * I * is the end of the movie. involving too much sex in a cartoon theme film does not increase its worth :( and most of all, I was surprised when the same cartoon ended up being used to show Mr.Invisible and it was really terrible I have to say, flour drops off the rack and our very own Mr.Invisible becomes visible "see ZACK and MIRI make a porn" I bet you will not get bored, <br /> <br /> 1/10 from me
