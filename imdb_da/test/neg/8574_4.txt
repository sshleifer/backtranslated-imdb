The biggest mistake in this Spanish slasher / shocker is within its script. In the first half hour it is an okay effort that builds some excitement and an atmosphere of fear and fear. We even get some good killings too! Then it goes all the way downhill and becomes a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clich√©s". I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. The last thirty minutes consist of some killings and much ran around in an abandoned monastery. It should have been so much better (though the final scenes in the flooded room are quite okay)! First of all we have the dialogue. It's awful most (there were a few giggles in the audience here and there when I saw it) and only enough elsewhere. It is also not easy to hear under many scenes, drowning under sound pressure and soundtrack (though it may not be so bad when we consider the stupid lines we should listen to!). There is a line in the whole movie, referring to "I know what you did last summer" movie, indicating that the filmmakers wrote it all as a big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> And the end ... yes, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me it was mostly a question of the first because the final twist comes from nowhere! If the audience had some clues to the girls' mental status, I might have thought otherwise. It also throws all logic out of the window because the killer could never have been in place for some of the killings! But as an avid horror fan I have learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But everything is not bad. The film has a great budget appearance, mainly because of the excellent filmography (the scenes of past times really shine here), close editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Although most of the actors are rather poor, Anita Briem is an exception that gets the most out of her work. Real screen presence! <br /> <br /> And as I mentioned before, the killings are gory enough for fans of such things, and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water (but the "water theme" tends to become tiring in the end.) <br /> <br /> So to finish this review, it's a movie that is quite fun in a "so bad-it's-good" kind of way, and it's also pleasing to the eye . But don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will, judging from the trailer and plot descriptions.
