I can't believe Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The reason (and I use this phrase very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize a townhouse complex - at least I think that was what it was about. The script had no meaning whatsoever, I could not care less about the characters and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing shots of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American man, I often read grounds from my brothers and sisters to "support African American films." I'm trying to help but probably enough. No one should see anything on waste like this. Please, brothers and sisters, do not produce more directly to video rats like this. Please!
