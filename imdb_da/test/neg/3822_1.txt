Any scary movie that casts Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) Then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits have even run, should immediately be seen with nothing but suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a swamp tour guide (his James Earl Jones voice impression is hysterical by the way, I don't know or care if he was trying to be fun, but I was laughing at it). Unfortunately, his role was also 5 minutes long. More reasons for suspicion and quite right. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony from Buffy & Angel, I had to look her up to see what I remembered from her but she gets semi-nude!), Marcus the token black guy (not another teen movie) fills a comedy role that is really not required in a horror movie unless it is meant as a spoof. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother & Pete from Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy shoots the gonzo video with the 2 cute girls. Taking a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", the two available male characters meet up with some other people and get around the rocks and leave the boat. So their now all is isolated in the swamp at night in the rain. <br /> <br /> When the real story of Victor Crowley has been told (his make-up resembled Sloth from The Goonies) we have found that he is dead (well you won't be back from being hit in the skull with An ax!) When the old guy is attacked, despite pulling his gun and having a very clear shot, it takes Marybeth more than 30 seconds to actually start shooting at a guy who makes an old man apart with a hatchet. Is she stupid? It's 29 seconds too long! With regard to plot, there really is not one (I do not class the undead psycho as a plot, sorry) and pacing is also really bad. You have a killing, some run away, a little relief, then a little slow dialogue before you start the bike again. After an extremely long scene exploring a wobbly bush with a raccoon in it, Victor is again shown (with some kind of power tool) and kills the dark-haired porn girl, he also manages to cut the tour guide in half with a shovel? When Misty is back on her own to look for Ben, I felt it was pretty obvious she should be the next to die (I was right, but you won't see it). <br /> <br /> Film makers? Rain won't turn off burning gasoline, okay? Idiots! Of course after the two almost missed in the cemetery, Marcus was next to death, and Ben was injured in the foot with the tip, but they managed to find a boat after Victor had hit the tip. <br /> <br /> She's pulled into the water by something unseen, he's trying to save her so she is suddenly pulled into the boat by Victor and screams and the film finally breaks. <br /> <br /> Yes, just like that. No idea Ben was dead (he seemed to be missing an arm) and no idea Marybeth would survive and what happened to Victor. It's a horrible ending and no doubt my verbal attack on filmmakers got the last review deleted. So much for freedom of speech, eh?
