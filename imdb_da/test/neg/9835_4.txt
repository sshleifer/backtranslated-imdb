The Girl in Lovers Lane is a strange little budget film. On its surface, the film tells the story of a hard drive called Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking for a young child named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl Carrie (Joyce Meadows) who Bix meets as would likes to take care of him. Nothing too interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot etc.) Until approx. 10 minutes to go to the movie when Carrie is murdered. Her father accuses Bix of pulling him out of a prison cell and almost knocking him to death. Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix. <br /> <br /> Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought it might just be me who read more about Bix and Dana's relationships than there really was, but now I see that I'm not alone. It was clear to me early that Bix and Danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a 1959 movie. The homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. Their live and sleeping arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to commit to Carrie, and that the phone call at the end when Danny tells his parents that he "is home to a friend is a few Examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there is more to their relationship than originally meets the eye, I'm sure they exist, but I can't think of any movies I've seen from the 50s that scream Homosexuals as high as this one <br /> <br /> As for the movie, I don't know any other way to put it in. It's boring, as I wrote earlier, nothing happens at all for 90% of the maturity. The characters are boring and the actors are not good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane much of a spark. The only exception is Jack Elam, his crazy Jesse is the one character that is interesting enough to be worth seeing. scary down pat! I guess The biggest problem I had with the movie was with character motivation and logic. Carrie's guy d and Bix is ​​immediately blamed? What about crazy Jesse who has stalked Carrie for probably her entire life? Anyone thinking of asking Jesse where he was that night? Her father has seen him disturb Carrie at dinner, but he never thinks learning Jesse might have anything to do with his daughter's death? Not much logic there. And what about Ises announcement? Danny grabs Jesse by lapel and that's all it takes to force a confession out of Jesse? Really hard guy, huh? Why would he confess so easily? And when he confesses, does anyone seem to catch him? It's awfully nice that Jesse just stays and doesn't run off. In another reality, he would never have wasted his gut and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered by the murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane is asking me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the character is something I am not willing to do. Overall, I give The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10.
