First, this film was made in 1978. So it tells you that the movie gets bad anyway. But I'm not saying that all old movies are bad. Secondly, the special effects we are terrible for then. Finally, The acting was so bad, Bozo The Clown could have done better. It makes you wonder how people get the money to make movies into this pathetic one. This movie sucks!
