So you have a number of models on an island and one by one they are picked by Agatha Christie style. We get someone lost at sea, pushed by a rock, poisoned by a solvent, driven by a rock, burst, etc. Nothing terribly graphic. Before any of it starts, a woman inexplicably has a dream of a murderer in a strange human face mask. <br /> <br /> The owner of the blade is a sleaze who had an affair and someone had taken pictures of her before she was old. <br /> In the end, it's all about business, or something. <br /> <br /> There is an 80-inch style photo shoot shooting, most swimsuits are one-piece surprising. A couple are quite translucent. There are camera clicks during the installation, where the camera's frame is displayed as a white square or rectangle in the image. The photographer is pretty bad at framing!
