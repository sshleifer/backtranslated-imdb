Seriously, if I wanted to make a movie that gives zero sense, will never and have lesbian scenes as the only highlight I could have. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst of this movie. Someone could have made a better movie, where at least some answers were given, and the story wasn't that slow and long lasting. The story means nothing without something in the end beyond the credits. what a waste of time. I will never get the 147 minutes of my life back and hope others can learn from my mistakes.
