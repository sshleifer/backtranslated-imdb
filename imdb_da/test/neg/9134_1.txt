Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this last submission of the trilogy is a big disappointment. They were also carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own picture in the movie ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. I actually thought Steven Soderbergh had instructed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, instructed this. I suppose they just don't have the budget to make a decent movie. You'd think Francis Ford Coppola would have wanted to be part of this movie and help get more money together.
