This movie was horrible! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented tap dancer and singer (actually a little better than Temple compared to the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as Shirley, as we watched on the screen of her movie, whether she is playing her screen or offscreen persona. So what we get is an overly cutesy and totally unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If you want to see the side of her, you can just rent one of her movies. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's portrayal of Gertrude Temple. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well-acted. Save yourself the trouble and hire The Poor Little Rich Girl.
