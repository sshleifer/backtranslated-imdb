I saw the * star * of this movie at The Daily Show, and thought I could tune in (the movie was premiered on Comedy Central, then went into theaters). Oh Vey! <br /> <br /> This makes "Shakes the Clown" similar to "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a laugh, not even a laugh. This movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes break out like the last remnants of "Raiders". I can't even think of a worse movie, be it "Manos" or "Ishtar". As the pythons waved, run away, run away! Why did anyone make this green unless they used their own money? The fear is that there is not a good line, not a good joke, and only a bad thing ... the making of this movie. I feel that if that happens correctly, it would have been hilarious. As it is, I need a new pancreas for retching so high. Damn someone involved in this travesty.
