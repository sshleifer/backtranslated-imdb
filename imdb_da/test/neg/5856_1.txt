This movie is a little more than a replacement Verhoeven. The film must be tele-realistic, but is simply sick. The parody disappears after approx. 15 minutes to be replaced by a story that looks serious. Brechtian breaks for non-existent ad brakes are boring and even painful; Undoubtedly there was no real intention to make this movie Brechtian, it was just an accident that happened like that. To watch a parody of reality TV, watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it's more fun and wittier, and most importantly shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain while watching a movie. Avoid as a rabid rabbit.
