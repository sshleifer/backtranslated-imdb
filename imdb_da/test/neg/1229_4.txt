This is a bad cartoon of "Lonesome Dove" - ​​and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" among the top three. I have admired the way you look at yourself through your characters, with such infinite honesty, balanced by never taking too seriously. So I'm spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why have you come to this? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" is not up to your standards. I see you're credited with screen writing, but it's as unlike you, I prefer to believe it's written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic and wants someone to break out with a naturally stated phrase. The part about 'genius' was agonizing. McCrae was irrevocable - mainly because of the inane words that came out of the mouth. <br /> <br /> I also miss Call. <br /> <br /> The most important missing factors are Gus and Call and the men they are: their material-courage; the underlying vein consisted of ethics and honesty their lack of confidence. Hard men lead hard life with some undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some guilt is tying to the worked direction here and throughout. All the required dialects and dialogue coaching. <br /> <br /> As I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, speaking the same dialogue, it gets better - but not much. It tries to sound cowboy-of-few-words shy, sly-grin witty, but doesn't succeed half ... <br /> <br /> How can it be so different from "Lonesome Dove"? Can the author forget his characters? You have fooled some of the people, Mr. McMurtry - but not this one.
