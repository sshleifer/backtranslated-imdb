"Kicked in the Head" is about the Corrigan character, a twenty man on the quest to find himself and his involvement with a handful of distinctive characters. This thin and ambiguous story written by Corrigan has a make-it-up-as-you-go feel and a manuscript that smells like an uninspired low budget indie. In spite of that and some annoying Hindenburg scene interjections, the film has an off beat, quirky kind of charm that can, in a small way, appeal to people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some. (D +)
