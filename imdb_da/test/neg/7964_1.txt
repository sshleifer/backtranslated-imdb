I don't like Cary Grant, but I have found his performances annoying in enough movies to notice; this, Arsenic & Old Lace and Bringing Up Baby. I don't like him in the north by the northwest, but I really find that movie unbearably silly. In addition, I find the endless raving about Grant's class tiring. I don't have a clue what his class does for viewers named it. It doesn't matter to me. <br /> <br /> In the back-scene feature that comes with this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says Grant was her father's favorite man; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better leader in a number of better Hitchcock movies. <br /> <br /> With it's broken ends, this really is half a film and doesn't carry any discussion and can't support the high ratings it gets. Even if the film had it intact, there is not much to it. Fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker. She has to remain numb, inactive and unwilling to contact anyone other than Johnny for the whole movie, at each end, for him to work. It's not much to work with. Cary Grant begins every line of "Monkeyface ..." until I stifle him. He says it about sixty times. It is a positive grid. Hitch's technique here is shockingly low. An infinite order of space / set has a false skylight projected on the back wall as a spindle web effect. And a light bulb in a glass of milk can make the fans excited, but it can't save a movie that is badly made. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich should retire if he makes another Hitchcock / Cary Grant imitation on a DVD. I think it's his entire career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, okay, shit, here comes an imitation that he is only impressed with. Instead, there were two! Oh joy!
