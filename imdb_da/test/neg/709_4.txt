I just watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as Utopia-on Internet Archive, which expects to see some extra footage as the IA version had a maturity of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that it is basically the same version I saw earlier on the VHS tape from Goodgimes Home Video, which ran an hour and 23 minutes (except that no product placement of the Welch grape juice was inserted when a bottle became shown) with the remainder of the maturity set aside for dark voids. While Stan looks as though he might die anytime soon, he still performs a fine physical comedy with Ollie for much of the first 45 minutes or so. So plotted to take a yacht with a stopover and a man without land on board - not to mention a charming female French singer who also comes to live in an unknown island, they all end up taking over with any complications that pretty much kills the comedy down and never restores despite the well-known conclusion of Ollie who says for last time to Stan: "Here's another nice mess you've got me!" before Stan cries uncontrollably before it fades out. In other words, if you are a die-hard Laurel and Hardy fan, this movie is recommended to watch at least once. Anyone who wants to get acquainted with this classic comedy team should seek their previous work they did for Hal Roach from the 20s up to 1940 when they completed their final Roach movie, Saps at Sea. Come to think of it, although some of the L&H Fox flicks (haven't yet seen the two they made for MGM) from the 40s are better than this ... Update-8/29/09: Only seen some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the captain. In another, the captain's wife pulls a gun at Cherie. In one more, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is baptized in high tone here!
