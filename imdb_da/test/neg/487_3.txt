I'm not expecting a classic, but at least a funny movie. There were only a few scenes that make you laugh, but no more. You don't scare it, it's filled with American teen slasher clich√©s, and you can guess what's going on easily. <br /> <br /> But it tells a lot about a senior student in a Turkish high school. The pressure of the Student Selection Exam (OSS), that the 3-hour exam determines which university you want to go and think of the exam, when a ghost is after you are not exaggerated. The movie is bad. Don't waste your time watching it.
