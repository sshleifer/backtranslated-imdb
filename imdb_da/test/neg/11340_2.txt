As much as I hated the movie that this series follows, at least I can say that Zangief was entertaining. The animated series may be one of the worst things ever produced. The animation is quite often inconsistent, although it remains consistently poor. The shape of a character's face is even able to change drastically in the same shot. The manuscript and voice act also provide something that is desirable, as most of the players seem to be as talented as thrown into a third drama. Characters such as Cammy and DJ are then forced to stereotypes of their nationalities that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to see, not that the series is not painful at regular intervals anyway. Episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of lame with each turn and are so full of plot holes that amaze me they had time to show advertisements. Truly, it amazes me that someone will pay to advertise during the show. Besides being a bad series, it is an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations from the movie. Examples are Ken and Ryu, there are idiot con men (although Ken must be rich), Blanka is Guile's friend Charlie, and Chun Li is reporter. It takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse.
