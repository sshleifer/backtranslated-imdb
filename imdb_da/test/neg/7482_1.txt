Carson Daly must be the only late night talk show host who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! He's not fun! Scripture is horrible to! All the sketches are painful to see. The current new karaoke is not fun at all, especially as he tells you what to sing before singing it! Escalator interviews are just stupid and it is superfluous to say no fun at all. All he jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least clever, stupid, not funny jokes ever put on TV! I mean, whenever he makes a Jessica Simpson joke, he joins "because she's stupid," which cancels any joke that was already very low. Any 3-year-old could have gotten some of the jokes and sketches that they put on this lame excuse for a show. Seriously, don't see this show unless you're on the verge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.
