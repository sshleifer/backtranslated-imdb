*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS UNDER THIS *** <br /> <br /> What a long and most uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why didn't I care about them? If I want to watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to break some or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the wealth to be found in the new world. Besides that, we learned a little about most of his family's hopes, fears, etc. When they started an adventure in the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy himself in this movie? She said little; We knew a little about her or what she did (was she forced to serve men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were to reach New York. To those who might suggest that she had to emphasize the point that a single woman, but cultivated, could not enter that country alone, I say that there is insufficient reason to give her so much screen time . This point could have been made in five minutes, with Lucy as an instant sign. <br /> <br /> More Questions: Why wasn't the twin brother on the boat meeting the family? We heard about the brother, and some closing at this time would have been useful to give the film some coherence. How long was the journey from Italy to New York? Considering the ship's condition, it makes a difference to the viewer if the journey took five or ten or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing a "week" at some point, but I think that was when they were already on the road.) I needed these types of details to better understand what they were going through. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really liked was when the boat, full of passengers, left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you choose to rent this movie, do so with the remote control in your hand; You may want to have quick forwarding practical. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can suggest that with the right voice transfer, you provide useful information on times and circumstances for immigrants - especially during the slow stretches of endless pictures of the landscape, people walking, etc. - this movie may have made an interesting public TV documentary.
