This conglomeration fails so miserably at all levels that it's hard to decide what to say. It doesn't deserve a line, much less ten, but to comply with the rules of IMDb goes here and I probably won't succeed the first time and have to write a little more to make up for this post to be accepted. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen this schlock during the 70's while I was going through my sponge phase, I still thought it was unimaginative and low. The most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door was opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> A person here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess as if it were a red letter day in his life. One can only ask that something much more exciting arises in that poster life. Get it, amigo.
