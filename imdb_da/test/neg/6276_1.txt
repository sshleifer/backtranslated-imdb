This movie resembled exits of the deleted scenes from a high school high school. It made no sense! It was well acted, but I only felt sorry for the signs because they had to appear in this slop. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity they were crabs! The underdogs and barely foreigners were hairdressers with legs. Where were the tripods? The editing, done by director / author / producer / make-up artist / gripper Latt, jumps everywhere, with some scenes repeated several times. Most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slam him. In 2005 alone, he produced 11 films! It does not include editing, editing, managing or visual effects on other movies. If the rest is like this snot-load, he just makes fun of us. This was a slack rip-off of Spielberg's films, nothing more. I look forward to Latt's "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The Hillocks has eyes."
