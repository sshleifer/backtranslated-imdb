The only reason anyone would see this movie would be because of John Leguizamo. I remember the previews and it seemed to be another second rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo star, tried to redeem it. His name, where it was known at that time or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was pretty disappointed with the performance of Leguizamo. His days at "House of Buggin" (a "live color" clone) were his tip-top. There is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy and we just want to say that Leguizamo crossed it tenfold. He looked as if he was trying to be scandalous and crazy for the camera. In fact, I say he was trying too hard. Madcap humor wasted in stupidity and the movie was spoiled. I can't say I blamed him if you got this option, would you try so hard if you could not? Your zeal costs you dearly, even if Mr. Leguizamo ... Pest follows the tradition of any comedy film and plays the "race card" and more. No group is left out of being poked fun on. Black, Latin American, White, Jews, Koreans, Germans, Homosexuals and the Blind are among those appointed. Again, things are getting overboard and too much is trying to be forged in too little time. The movie's resolution takes every five minutes to clean up and move back to normality. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie and you have to bypass plot and reality for the sake of comedy, just make sure it's fun, or whatever you have is 90 minutes of meaningless movie. Which would sum up Leguizamo's "Pest" quite nicely ...
