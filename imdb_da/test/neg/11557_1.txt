I think I can safely say (without giving away) that this movie had no robots in it. The boys in "robot" costumes do not work or speak as such, and the evil unit behind the whole "plot" is also not a robot. It all looked like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with pictures falling in the background when the instructor needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe the actor ... <br /> This couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of "Star Crystal". In short, it is clearly one of the worst sci-fi movies from the 80s, and I would be as bold as saying "for the time being".
