This movie was taken from my girlfriend's mother who worked in a charity shop. She gave it to us along with a lot of other unknown cassette tapes. The movie itself is a bit dirty. There are a few notable bits to laugh as little as his girlfriend gets her head drilled in, but generally the movie is gentle. Interstingly when I saw the trailer to "The Island" I couldn't help noticing the similarities. Clonus may have been the inspiration for that movie? All in all, not bothering to watch this movie as it is boring and boring. We enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after that. Another sign of this movie is a bit crazy, are the shots behind the videotape not actually in the movie? strange
