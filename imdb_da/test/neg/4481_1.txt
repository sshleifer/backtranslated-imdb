I was very excited about this movie! my expectations were under control because i read the book first soooo i expected differences. What I didn't expect was how big the differences were. Starting with the characters physical appearance ... as Channing Tantum's lack of tattoos n Amanda Seyfried is not a brunette lol, but I let it go ... the sign development was not there at all ... you didn't have time to love amanda seyfried character and you could not feel for her or john when they first separated ... i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated she left first when he ... it took away the emotional separation ... and why did they change tim from the book ... why did they make him a father instead of a brother and why did they make him sooo old and the movie lacked the intense moment when they found out what was happening at the end (didnt want to spoil it lol, but for those who looked at it, you know what i mean) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy changed the ending ... in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional, and it emphasized Channing Tatum's character's decision, who had they angry ... it just got it looks like a hood sad ending ... it was terrible ... tha ts what disappointed me most ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same: (
