To describe what is seriously wrong with this movie, it should contain some * spoilers * so if you want to see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie except the plot; And in a thriller like this credible plot is crucial. It is well traded if a little slow moving, and the camera works and Portland scenes are exquisite for a low budget, unpretentious image. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is severely withdrawing youth working at an insurance telemarketing company. His high school companion, Berkeley, is his employer and looks after him as a brother despite Mason's obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that send him shivering and fumbling for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with beautiful women in his past, and the film seems to indicate that he can be a serial killer for women. He meets a perky, beautiful girl named Amber, and he draws her in her notebook. She looks like him and asks him to paint his portrait. He sees more of her and begins to awaken from his recalled state and becomes almost halfway man. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls, and she begins to wonder. She gets scared and pulls away. We wonder if her sudden cold should push him over the edge. His behavior becomes more irregular. <br /> <br /> This is the setup for the revelation. To explain how this movie goes awful, I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * For this plot to work, we believe that Amber, a really outgoing, beautiful young girl, should go to a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who at least at the beginning of their friendship has a free stare and can only speak in monosyllables or do not speak at all. He is far beyond nerdy, he appears on the brink of total catatony. Yes, I know girls can be attracted to all kinds of weird, but usually Charles Manson-type or punk-rockers, guys with some kind of vicious manic energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he is almost not at all. Any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him. It's just not credible that this girl is attracted to him. In addition, there is no credible reason for Berkeley to spoil the crazy Mason, nor is it credible. <br /> <br /> But wait, there's a revelation. Amber fails to appear in Berkeley's house for Christmas dinner, where Mason expects her, and Berkeley, his old friend, tells him that Amber and all his other former friends, those he drew in his many sketchbooks, do not exist with everyone! She and all the others are merely figures of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. This explains why a normal sweet Amber would go to Mason, she is just a fantasy of his imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup, but unfortunately it is not. At this point Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he's furious, he's killing her. But now we get to understand that Amber was actually real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, after proofing that Amber actually exists and Mason killed her, Berkeley must admit that he was mistaken that he failed Mason. This would work if Mason had been halfway sane from the start, but because we audiences always suspected him to be horrified and possibly a killer of women, this is no surprise to us. We suspect what he was together and didn't understand why Berkeley couldn't see it. But then again we have to wonder: if she was right, why Amber would be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To make the end worse, do we never understand whether all other Masons lovers, those in the sketchbooks, were real or were Amber the first real? And if the others were genuine, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. Maybe there could have been a way to correct and tell a credible suspension story, but this movie is not.
