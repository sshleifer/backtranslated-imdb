The short existence of Sex Pistols and the production of this film after the controversial, breakthrough English punk band collapse occurred both before I was born. But I started listening to their only album, "Never Mind the B * &% @ # & s, Here's the Sex Pistols, in 2003 when I was a teenager and quickly became a big fan. I didn't see "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" until 2006, but saw it a couple of times that year, and thought it was pretty good (certainly not good but pretty good), although I could only remember bits of it and not how it was all connected. Seeing it a third time, almost three years after the second, I didn't really care much about it at all. I'm not even sure what I found so good about most of it initially (can't remember now). <br /> <br /> This movie is a mockumentary in which Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells his side of the band and its members guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, credited as "The Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited as "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (namely Johnny Rotten) is credited as "The Collaborator." McLaren claims he created the band (and even the punk rock genre) as a scam to make money. He tells much of the story of Helen Wellington-Lloyd (a.c. Helen of Troy), in various places where they go together. It's basically a hodgepodge of McLaren, Pistols songs, live footage of the band, fictional scenes (often stupid, weird), more comic strips, etc., all in one movie to tell the Pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way! <br /> <br /> It has been well proven that McLaren is a liar, I know many have already pointed this out, including band members themselves. He was NOT the driving force of the band, he did not create them (nor did he invent punk rock, and Sex Pistols were not even the first punk band, even though they were unique). The band members were the ones who made the band what it was. "The Filth and the Fury", a much more credible film about the Julien Temple band that made this film, is told from the band members' point of view, which contradicts McLaren's claims. But the dishonesty of "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" is not my biggest problem with it. If it were actually entertaining (as I used to think it was to some extent), I would be able to overlook what I used to do, of course. During my third show, except for Sex Pistols songs, some live footage and at least a mildly funny cartoon sequence, it was pretty boring! I found the "Who Killed Bambi" song mildly funny at first, but it became tiresome very quickly. Is This Mockumentary Worth Looking At Sex Pistol Fans? It seems that a large number of fans will say it is, not to learn about the true story of the short-lived but groundbreaking 70-punk band, but for entertainment. It was once my opinion of "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle". After the first time I saw it, I couldn't remember anything that McLaren said, and when I saw it the second time, I realized what the Pistols manager was using this movie to mean, but still couldn't remember anything I heard him say! Of course, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after my third impression, I can definitely remember some of the things McLaren says, but it was still not 100% clear. As most of the movie, I think his words are not so memorable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you are a Pistols fan, I think it wouldn't hurt to give "Swindle" a try, but for me it's mostly just a disjointed, boring mess trying to be fun but fails.
