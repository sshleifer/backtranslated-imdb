This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style but the marketing strategy. There may be part 2, third three ... until one day ends the product's life cycle, of course, provided part 1 has a commercial success. so many things seem to be hidden, and so the story looks rather incomplete. the action design is boring. set design is ok but not fine. Perhaps Edison Chen would be a great star someday. He looks really charming, even on the big screen. The most impressive is still Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
