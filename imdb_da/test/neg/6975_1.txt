And generally, you should finally examine this little gem. When I describe I changed my gender or Glen or Glenda as it is better known, I must echo Andrew Smith's thoughts, which then hit the nail on his head when he wrote, "If you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's other films, this is a completely confusing experience. If you've seen some of Ed Wood's movies, it's still quite confusing. "The movie is both hilarious and tragic, but it moves with a strange rhythm that doesn't doubt the author knows means every word he says during his run. Wood, blessing him, had some of the highest ambitions as a director who wants to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s all the time. When Tim Burton restored a view of Glen Or Glenda by studio experts for his biopic, he showed that the execs laughed and told each other that this should be a put-on. More than fifty years later, there are still people who are struggling to get the kind of respect that the "normal" takes for granted, so I'm certainly not saying it. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy in Glen or Glenda is the pure tenure Wood shows in composing his message. Directors often use stock footage when they can find some that fit their purpose, and can be edited to suit their own recordings. Ed Wood used archive footage without distinction, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene where Wood played by Johnny Depp wasted that he could make a whole movie out of stock footage. Unfortunately, the right Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen or Glenda is the closest he ever came. IMDb states that 20 percent of this 60-minute movie is stock footage and it's never hard to guess which footage is. Recordings of busy highways, planes flying overhead, bad light effects, soldiers doing their thing, they are all used in a random way, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story. Wood is trying to tell. Had Wood been able to sit back and think about what he was trying to do for a while, no one was telling what kind of heights he could have achieved. <br /> <br /> Wood itself appears in the movie as a titular character, a confused transvestite that imagines itself as a woman named Glenda. Except for the bold way he tries to make his point, Wood makes a horrible woman. Having found myself on the edge of a society that I think is "handicapped" and myself "healed", I honestly found myself in the best result for Woods character. To make his point, however, Wood is in short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the utmost steps to maintain a sex change to become a woman, the other finds himself terribly afraid that he will be arrested again as much as he commits suicide. The scary thing about this movie is that if you edited transvestism and replaced such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little of the movie would even be changed. This is how the little community learned, since Ed Wood was a boy. The other important personality in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, which Wood shoe horns into the movie. The speculation varies from Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career and would do everything possible to achieve this. With the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good movie, it is. In Glen or Glenda, Wood uses Lugosi, best described in Flying Saucer Over Hollywood as "bizarre". Lugosi plays a character billed as the scientist, but comes from more like a omnipotent doll master. People who have not watched Ed Wood before the biopsy will believe Tim Burton was "watch out for the big green dragon sitting on your doorstep". If anything, Burton was persistent about what bizarre speech to use to portray the Wood-Ian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speakers in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious ranting under Plan 9 from outer space. Observant types will also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's boyfriend at that time. Again, Burton dramatizes her reaction to seeing the script for the first time while the film portrays her as accepting and thinking. I can't help but feel that Burton's portrayal is more accurate, as Fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in his role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her caste friends, if such a thing is possible. If Wood's direction was better focused in this case than normal, it is difficult to determine, but if the support's ability to leave the stars (with the clear exception of Bela) in the dust is some guidance, then it should come as no surprise that Fuller would only occur in a very small role within another wood film. That she continued to write a series of hit songs tells you that she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood was coming to the camera again, it was never more than a cameo, a walk-on or a bit part. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glenda one in ten. I generally only give this rating to movies that are so bad that they become entertaining as a result. Bold and appropriate as it was, Glen Or Glenda fits that description to a T.
