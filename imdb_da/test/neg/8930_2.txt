Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course, as a once-in-a-lifetime fan who has become increasingly dissatisfied, I can say that it comes as no surprise that this is quite boring. First, the film made headlines because of apparent production problems due to Seagal. He would show up late on the change, change the manuscript, crew, etc. And generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his problems enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming Mercenary, which promises to be as bad as this waste. This also marks a major turning point in Seagal's career because this film is the first of his to really dig out stock footage. There was a bit of ticker, but this movie takes biscuits. They borrow bits from The Order (A Van Damme movie, Seagals biggest rival in DTV movies!) No Code of Conduct, Undisputed, and also a whole action sequence from the little-known Peter Weller starring Top of the World. Interestingly enough, car chase stolen from the Weller epic, made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this waste, is actually by far the best action scene of the movie. I was shocked enough when Dolph Lundgren had a short stint in the action video world, which he happily escaped. Seagal, however, is the leader of the DTV action market at the moment, with Van Damme and Snipes its biggest rivals. Seagal still manages to sell movies and for the life of me I do not know how. Of course, the fans must be bored with this awful longing and longing for a return to people like Over The Law. The story here is completely paralyzed. In fact, the film has so many plot holes it doesn't just think of. For example, at the end of a movie there is a little girl, like Seagal, apparently at an orphanage to which he gives a necklace. Why don't I know, but we never see her in the rest of the movie, or hear her mentioned. Seagal has a girlfriend in this movie who at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and she is haunted by visions that at the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued together by a number of pointless papers that it becomes headache inducing. This is by far Seagal's stupid movie! Seagal itself is like wood as always, but for his credit he is not called in this as far as I could tell. However, Seagal feels the need to talk like he is a gangsta rapper, which makes me yearn for the days he wanted his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his classic early movies. He also has a painfully unfunny double action with Treach, which I assume is a rapper. It's fun how manufacturers seem to think that combo Seagal plus hip hop star seems like working because his team up with DMX in Exit Wounds was his most successful movie since Under Siege. Obviously, although no one has heard of the rapper, it will not work. However, it is an action movie, and then the action itself must be judged. Unfortunately, the action that did not come from the NU Image Back catalog is strictly routine. There are a few small combat situations with some classic Seagal aikido, but when 90% is done by his stunt double, which really has a rigorous training in this movie, it really isn't impressive much. There are also some standard gunfights that really only have some nice violent and bloody squibbage that goes to them. All in all, it is a painful boring experience, and once again I am back in giving the same judgment: Seagal has lost it! I continue to ask the year-old question now, "why do people still see his movie?" It is very good and good as a question, but the sad bastard that I continue to see his films in the confused hope, he can probably do something good again. Chances are slim, unlike Seagal's ever-growing waist. * 1/2
