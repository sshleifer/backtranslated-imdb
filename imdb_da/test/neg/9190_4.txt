This film essentially tries to depict the fire department's heroism by turning the whole movie around an American father with a good heart that sets others apart. Now I know they are trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father who is a firefighter, but as if there is nothing interesting about him what ever, so when the movie comes to the climax, there is only little or no emotion. This movie basically tries to make a firefighter's life exciting, but it just comes out as boring as other jobs, except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but someone could have played his role and he is a dull character like the rest of the movie. What could have been a good movie is that the firefighter is set up as heroes because they are firefighters and make the whole scenario an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
