There are places for political commentary in movies, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get plenty of these things from Newsweek and all the other editorials in the newspaper. Now should I see this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock movie, not another "Bush is bad!" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, let him go to Air America. And if you have to insist on making a "message" movie, be a little more dull about it. This had the whole insight into being beaten in the face with a dead fish. By the way, Joe, will you really have the left to be associated with brain-dead zombies? Maybe think about it before you make another political horror movie (God helps us).
