If you would have asked me a month ago how this movie was, I'd probably have left most of this, but I'm a fan and as a fan I've visited the movie sites often well, as Super Troopers came out, I visited this site After publishing on DVD and was hooked yes it is a difficult place to stay, but the good ones are usually like good families they stick together. What story is this company / comedy troop? BEGIN people to come and watch movies on street corners, universities, anywhere they can and all for free and after all, developing a big fan base after a few years. Decide to close your site that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it .... they didn't say any of them. They just decided that they are better than us, they want new fans, not the fans who helped them get where they are .... you know the same fans they asked years ago. Still, the smart crew are the ones they released the best movie with Super Troopers and got everyone's attention and thank God for it because they then sucked with everything else. Good for you way to go plain, just remember when you realize your material is not that good and you have no new fans left, you are the ones who crapped the original away. FANS makes you who you are not the other way around. Never burn your bridges
