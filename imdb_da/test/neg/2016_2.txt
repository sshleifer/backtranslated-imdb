A spaceship running through the galaxy meets a mysterious cargo ship apparently in the room. The crew examines, hopes to claim its cargo and acquire the ship. But once aboard the mischievous vessel, liberating their own ship mysteriously, leaving them to take care of themselves and fight no one else, Count Dracula or Orloff as this creature calls himself. <br /> <br /> Not a bad start. I think it follows a number of typical sci-fi / horror plots. The genres have existed enough that even the most original story will inevitably rely on comparison with another movie. But when you start with a rather typical frightening conference, the legend of Dracula and vampires is in general and combined with a rather typical sci-fi convention, a crew member who happens at something and gets marooned to battle whatever they are forced to do. To confront, the filmmakers have better dress up the sleeves to impress their own brand on the well-known genre advertising. Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this complete failure. So no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing to do with their sleeves, but their weapons. <br /> <br /> This movie begins viciously, with a very poorly delivered voice over by Caspar Van Dien, who essentially provides enough exhibit to explain who the crew of his ship is. I must also point out that Van Diens character is called Van Helsing. And, so much wise, this is the Orloff sign from the planet Transylvania in the Carpathian system. You do not say. I mean, come on guys, we get it. And again, don't be greasy and use such names unless you have something special in the store. <br /> <br /> So after Van Helsing's introduction of the crew, we essentially have a film about this crew member caught in a spaceship with a vampire wondering. <br /> <br /> I'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. Occasionally they can be brilliant, see Raimi's first two Evil Dead movies. The Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the wages of 3rd stringers such as Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. But unlike the EVIL DEAD flicks, there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but I want to give the actors an advantage for the doubt. It seems they don't know what to do. The best actor, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is killed quickly, and the eternally pleasing Udo Kier is reduced to being a show car for the viewer, as the deceased captain we hear and see through a video journal. Grant Swandby is also okay as a professor, but it is difficult to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and runs a wheelchair. And yes it is a WHEEL chair as there is nothing futuristic about it. What about the rest of the actors, as well. I'm sure Coolio really tried to be scary after being turned into a vampire, but I don't think annoying qualifies as scary in people's book. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak also do not give much. Lists are never really more than IL's big brawny black stereotype. Eleniak actually seems miserable throughout the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a beautiful girl, even in the mid-thirties, but looks a little worn and uninterested in the film's duration. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the Count Dracula / Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can't remember who exactly the vampire should be. He introduces himself as Orloff, but at some point he recognizes himself as Count Dracula. Go figure. In any case, you will be amazed at how lame this vampire is. Do you ever have scenes, the cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creation function time slots? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate on such a ridiculous outfit. I'm sure he's still being hassled by his friends. <br /> <br /> There's not much to the plot. The vampire is the last one of that kind and would like to travel to Earth for some reason and there is also some lip service to want to defeat Caspar Van Diens character, Van Helsing. Most of the crew is transformed into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and guns to try to defeat them before they count on the old effort in the heart routine. Yes, that's right, bullets and yes year 3000. Keep in the enchanting vein, one of the most important areas that the crew is hiding in while fighting with the vampires or the vampire, as there is never more than one who threatens them , is filled with old Soviet posters and insignia and the like. What? There are also references to God / religion that are outdated systems. But these references only confused me. Did the Soviet Union make a comeback? Is there anything Roodt and Milborrow will do with this? It never goes anywhere, seems stupid, and the posters, etc. Just look good. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is shot and edited. The kinematics is nothing spectacular, but it is clearly done by professionals, and I had no problem with the special effects. The ships look like ships in outer space. Although I write this, I remember where God horrible captain's body looks when the crew discovers him. What did they think? Why didn't someone say anything? See how hard it is to say something positive about this movie without falling back on the negatives? In the end, I think it's the case. No matter what positive things you are trying to give to this sci-fi / horror debacle, you will be overwhelmed by the lack of quality. Bad Udo Kier.
