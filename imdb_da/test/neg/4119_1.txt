I can't remember the last time a movie was so boring that I went out. Weatherman and The Island were both so bad I thought about it, but I was even in the end. This movie was incomprehensible, not fun and just went on and on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if parts were only French humor that I didn't get, or if the characters were serious. I finally gave up and tried to sleep because I didn't want to disturb my husband if he enjoyed it, but he noticed and let me know that it was OK if I wanted to leave and out the door we went. He wants to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died, etc. (I don't even like it).
