I am a Shakespeare lover since childhood. I'm also a Jew. The Merchant of Venice is anti-Semitic through and through, no matter how hard the scholars and literary lovers try to interpret it. In the play, Shylock is depicted as demonic and cold and has no forgiveness, no heat, no love except money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind, moral people. His motifs in the play are about money (he distinguishes revenge from the start on the basis of injuries caused by his business as well as blind race hat), not noble ideals or damaging racial pride, as this movie wants you to believe. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. As final proof is the happy end where the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I recognize this and continue. It's part of the story, and I enjoy Shakepeare despite this fact. Therefore, I expect a movie based on this game to play it straight. I would much rather see the work adapted to its rich language and storytelling without any laundering. <br /> <br /> However, many of the artificial subtleties of the bard and playful characters are lost in this movie. For example, in the last scene where the men discover Portia's undercover work as a man who also took their rings away, instead of the playful word and misunderstandings revealed by the truth, it becomes a medieval game where two bitch women instead, we are only left with lovely detailed sets, fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor casting, an intense court scene and a controversy. <br /> <br /> The truth is, I think it would be much easier to identify anti-Semitism in history and continue if it was back as it is. Despite all the whitewashed filmmakers pulled out of their hats, there is plenty of hatred left, only now people can make excuses and make it possible that the Jewish decor is not so bad anymore. <br /> <br /> And finally, another problem with most of the actors who miscast. Pacino is far from his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the horrible fake accent. Fiennes as Bassanio is charmless and awkward with the language. Iron is reliable as always, but does not do much with its role. Portia is somewhat OK but unlikeable, and covered in bad makeup, like the movie.
