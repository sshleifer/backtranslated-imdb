I mistakenly saw this movie thinking it was the other radio station zombie flick. Shonky production values ​​and the low-purity cast soon gave up that this was another of the cheap sci-fi channel style buttons. <br /> <br /> The key achievement of Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as dubious radio shock jock but as the movie continues to become less and less convincing as he actually has to act. The rest of the casting has little to do other than to look and not have any depth. The camera is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kinds of movies. Not even a decent bit of convincing do succeed, the zombies are literally pathetic except for a remarkable exception at the end of the movie. The film tries to inject originality and a message in it's confusion of half-baked and ripped off ideas somehow resembling this outbreak of intolerance to Islam and the war on terror. This is being dealt with tremendously with all the 6 year old intellectual assaults. Like the signs and apparently, the authors cannot distinguish the difference between race and religion - describes all people of a particular skin color as "Muslims". Most typically, a sign is revealed to be Muslim alone with skin color. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Probably the far better Pontypool had a similar budget that Dead Air still shines wherever this movie fails.
