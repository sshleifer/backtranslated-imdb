Opening with some blatantly reused recordings from 'Kit for Cat', 'Tweety's S.O.S' fails to live up to the classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic. Unlike the Chuck Jones Road Runner series, which attempted to introduce new jokes to the same setting, Freleng's series seemed happy enough to reuse jokes as long as the characters were in another place. 'Tweety's S.O.S', so largely constituting "this time let's put them on a boat". It's not a very weak cartoon. There are a few good jokes that mainly involve Granny's glasses, but they are offset by gags, you can see getting a mile away (the seasickness routine) and it all builds on another of those ends where someone other than Tweety says "I Tawt I Taw a Titty Tat", a joke that worked well once but has declining returns. 'Tweety's S.O.S' will probably like children who enjoy virtually any cartoon, but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags, it is definitely one to avoid.
