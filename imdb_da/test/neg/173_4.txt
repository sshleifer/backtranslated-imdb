It was really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary. And why all those stupid dog scenes, and then repeating all the same stupid dog scenes? This movie begins with a big promise - revealing international politics and business with wine. It came to a good start and included all the right characters. But production is a mess. Points started and evolved mostly so that they were never finished or left with hanging ends. Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christie's. <br /> <br /> Too much fluff and not enough facts for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Probably honored in Cannes because of the American bashing (though in my opinion there was too little of it). <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 am - I have no idea how much longer it ran.
