This is one of the rare movies that I did not immediately discuss with my friends after seeing it. It was not because it was particularly enchanted or impressed me. On the contrary, it had not given me anything. <br /> <br /> Why? That way, everything was so much exaggerated that I couldn't take this movie seriously anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film tried very, very hard to be offensive, as if it were aimed at superlatives in ugly rather than telling a compelling tale of two women trapped in a spiral of crime. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi was described as "Thelma & Louise with real sex" for me. It is true that the main idea is the same. There are two women traveling through the country because they have committed crimes and know that their lives are now complete, that the police are going to catch them, and they decide that now that everything is over, there is no way to keep back. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi had been described as a feminist movie in which women who had previously suffered men's dominance were precisely the revenge of the men they meet. <br /> <br /> This is something I have never interpreted in this movie simply because none of these women were ever innocent and because they not only kill irresponsible, violent men, but also men who seduce themselves, men who show that they will do the protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are by no means better than the characters they encounter and murder in horrible, brutal ways. How easily "heroines" choose to murder and how much joy they take in it, made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. It was just too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I had the feeling that sex and violence were only there to create a superlative in cruelty, rather than conveying a story or doing anything. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi left me with no impressions, hadn I was not thinking because it was so far removed from any real world. So constructed, unrealistic and over the top. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this movie. There was simply nothing to think about, except "Why did they make this horrible movie?" If the intense discomfort occurred in this movie, served a purpose, I would have easily accepted it. But since I didn't find anything since the film's story seemed to be no more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into a movie ... I filed it under "unnecessary torture", never decided ever EVER , watch this movie again, and now I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Worst, not just because it's really not my cup of tea to see people being raped, raping, having sex in other forms and killing each other ... but because it was the decision makers who would tell the world with their movie ... if they wanted to say anything at all ... it just didn't work. And there is nothing else that could save this movie because it is also recorded in such an ugly style.
