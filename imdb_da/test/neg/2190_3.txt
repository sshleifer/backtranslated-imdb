Los Angeles Doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident but ends up in prison in California's high desert. When his time is up, he lands in a small, wind-swept city called the Purgatory Flats. His first stop is a bar where he quickly slips a beer and is hired as a bartender. So much for ex-cons find it hard to find work. This is the first in a wide variety of absurdities that make up the plot of author / director Harris Done's stupid attempt at modern, desert-set, film noir. <br /> <br /> His first night at work Tom meets a sexy femme fatally named Sunny (Alexandra Holden) hanging out with a family of bad boys: Mecklins consisting of Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two nephews , the drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and AWOL soldier Randy ("90210's Brian Austin Greer). After his shift is finished, there is a shooting, and Dr. Tom happens to be nearby. He agrees to treat one of the wounded and most importantly not tell the police. I'm not sure it's a good move for a guy who's fresh out of the pen, but this script (written by Diane Fine) has little to do with the logic. Tom makes a series of bad decisions that make him longer and longer involved with the criminally inclined Mecklin Boys, including stealing medical supplies and jumping into the bag with Sunny. Everyone in the theater screams, "Don't do it! Go away", but Tom does it anyway. <br /> <br /> In a classic movie noir like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" we stand and empathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray as they are sucked into the net by bright, sexy, eerie femme fatals like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck. It's not their fault. We would probably be tempted by all the money or that lady. Men Dr. Toms weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than the circumstances. Sunny is sexy, but not a very convincing character, and there is no money to tempt him. You wonder if he attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria from "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> The stupid script would have you believe that a redneck's country house has almost everything you need to treat a shot in the stomach, and the wounded one could easily jump to attention and participate effectively in a fist fight. It gives us an improvisable car chase with one of these "The Club" things adhered to the wheel. Oh, the oil tanker just exploded - no one noticed it. I wonder how such a ridiculous script has ever gotten green? Maybe Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I gave him credit for. It is obvious that he took Randy's relatively small role - a hot-headed murder - to show producers that he had more plays than he showed at "90210". <br /> <br /> It is also a bit sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotypical Spanish dealer. He deserves better than this. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ over 50, "Purgatory Flats" will make you shake your head in disbelief. I give it 3 stars for the unintentional grin and the scenes with the sexy Miss Holden running around in her red panties.
