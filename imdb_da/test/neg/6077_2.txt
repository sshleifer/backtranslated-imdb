I myself am concerned that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with 'Amadeus' aside 'Copying Beethoven' deliberately choose the easy way by putting the audience within art. And so the world refuses a discerning, intelligent and creative work. Now consider the following: Isn't it possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony can actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and just as in a dramatic narrative? Beethoven was completely deaf by writing the symphony ?? isn't it more interesting? How was the symphony performed? Wouldn't it be good to know? So ask yourself what possible motivation could a filmmaker have to introduce a woman as a cop? If there was a cop, he would definitely be a man. What was his story? (Try to be a bit critical here, though you like the invention of a female composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy must be much more than a distortion of reality to serve the purpose of an author. For those who compare and justify the invention of Anna Holtz with the invention of Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in 'Amadeus', he believes that he confesses to a priest in a lunatic asylum (Schaffer uses this unit for great influence in the movie ). "Copying Beethoven" may have worked if Anna was a phenomenon of Ludvig's celebrated fantasy. But we are supposed to believe she is "possible" ... yes, and that Strauss was helped by foreigners. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I've read here so far are often a desire for the movie to be good; almost a conscious amnesia. Remembering the movie for what you want to be, rather than what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that imagination justifies the means, consider not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events, but also sacrificing truth for triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief comment on the play here that may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is not good as Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does it hurt you? He looks awkwardly through the entire movie, just like an actor dressed up but sitting and standing at the dining table. Most of his lines are said to be signs rather than answers to Anna Holtz's lines (ie he does not listen to the actor). He is obviously an actor who masks as the character instead of being the character. <br /> <br /> Really, how many times should Beethoven roll in his grave before we get it right? Just ask yourself, would Ludwig approve?
