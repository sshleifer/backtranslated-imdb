I love old "monster movies" for the pure camp value. This doesn't disappoint if you find that kind of fun. <br/> <br /> The actress is the pure 1950's stem crap. You get used to it when you've seen enough of these ... the dialogue is very stupid and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the huge bird. <br /> <br /> The science in this movie is fun. An outrageous second world bird that can manipulate anti-material ... intent on destroying and eating people ... a stranger who has come to earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the movie (not having the bird in them) include the "scientists" explaining what's happening. Much has been said about the ridiculous bird pop. It looks like a new baby bird ... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. It even cakes like a hungry, sour wild. The bird scared the crap out of my three-year-old who had great scary bird nightmares in the evening. It's a little scary. <br /> <br /> I was very sad at the place where they shoot the egg. (Somehow, the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird life, what can I say?
