"The Sad Cafe Ballad" worked hard on its image, but when it came down to short time, it remained standing in its own independent fabric. <br /> <br /> You can't imagine this high, but if Vanessa Redgraves Amelia were to fight with John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. Her depiction of Amelia was so close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi-million dollar contracted persona. Redgrave gave Amelia this soulful drawl, a mix of her own unique voice and a hard-earned woman from the south. For the average viewer, this could be interpreted as annoying, but when the film progressed, did it happen? Miss Amelia transforms this scene beauty into a rudeck. It was Redgrave's performance, as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this movie stand tall? but not the highest. The others after her performance were needed, but not stellar. As we moved past the creepy cliché picture transferred by all the designers employed for the post-Depression South job, the smaller characters felt like poster boards. The picture was necessary to set the scene, but the city's character had no other purpose. Take, for example, Rod Steiger's vision of some old, spoken preachers. His scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off-the-beaten-path city. The main two players who surrounded Amelia struggled with the charm of the admirable top stage-stealing moment, but due to lack of direction ?? it just seemed faded. The most absurd of the two (albeit high among the dubious sanitation line) is Cork Hubbard, who plays Amelia's "cousin" who turns out to be random one night. His character is never quite defined, he lacks true motive, and his loyalty remains uncertain. He plays no decisive role in this movie without forcing us, the viewers, to question his beauty and honesty. Can you create a sign by simply sticking out your tongue, flickering your ears and beating your chest and head? Finally, there is the other end of the absurd ?? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this troubled man build character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his purpose to flow. These were the characters, like cliché Southern as they were ?? Some stood forward and tried to create an absurdist era, and I cannot argue that they did not succeed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" failed to rise above mediocrity was in film and narration. This film was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. The audience's level of comfort with the arrival of her miniature cousins ​​was entertaining ?? One couldn't wonder if he was honest or just a trustee trying to leech a warm heart. Cork Hubbard's character is never quite understood, but we accept him with short pictures of him and Amelia makes small things together. It is his idea that turns from a recluse businesswoman to a bona fide café owner. The problem is that director Callow never really takes us to the dramatic ceiling level between Cork and Redgrave? is the man crazy or does he represent the entire Amelia family? I needed something from Callow that brought these two out of the David Lynch-esquire relationship they had. Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia's "love interest". Using a flashback technique within a flashback we see the two wed but never enforce their love ?? which Amelia is angry with their love, drawing him into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so sour? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was it in the movie? With the lack of focus on these comics, the final scenes between the two made no sense ?? Throw in Cork's choice and it just gets completely discombobulated. While there were a couple of beautiful choreographed scenes that Callow created, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus, interest, and care for the characters fell as I didn't understand the ultimate question ?? "Why"? <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Ballad of the Sad Café" began with a bang, but ended up with a very small crack in a firecracker. My emotional feeling of this movie swung up and down, up and down, and joined further down mainly due to lack of understanding of the characters. Redgrave did a phenomenal job like Amelia, and while the other characters (outside the random Steiger) tried their best, I didn't quite understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional ending finally came, I was apathetic. Director Callow seemed to have lacked importing liaison scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our major players. Callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the landscape, allowing us to focus on Amelia ?? or Carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. The movie played out with anger, discovery, happiness, feedback, anger, anger, anger, fall out. Without the comparative connectors, this transformed from upscale period movies to actors playing parts in front of the camera. It was a shame because "Sad Café" had lifted it, it just couldn't deliver. <br /> <br /> Degree: ** ½ out of *****
