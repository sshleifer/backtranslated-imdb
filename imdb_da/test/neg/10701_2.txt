This movie stunk. There is not much more to it. The final battle looked as if Walker took my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with a force of ten men. I found the ads more interesting. The reason angles and jokes could be seen as a kilometer away. The only redeeming quality of this movie was that it ended. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you enjoy bad Chuck Norris movies.
