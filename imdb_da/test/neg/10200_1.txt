I saw Gomeda at the cinema in my town. My friend took me away and I was really curious how it looked. Now I have to say. This movie was not a horror. Perhaps we can say that it is 'fantasy-like experimentation'. Okay, here I go anyway. But there were lots of footage, drama, theatrical and storytelling problems. I can understand because the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. OK Managing this movie wasn't bad, I see. Unfortunately, due to the limitations imposed on the film at its extremely low budget, the images are often as creepy as history. And there are no powerful gothic scenes. As a horror movie, it really fails, no scary at all, and it's pretty confused and boring. Some people say 'Gomeda' is an art movie, but I couldn't see a ridiculous, horrible and broken art movie like that. So, how can we say it's an art movie! Just fun!
