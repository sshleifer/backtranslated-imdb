The only good thing about this movie is that I now have a movie on the worst ever list. Rest Stop being at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all horrible movies to. Really, this movie is the worst plot, worst directed, throughout the movie was all I wanted to do, pulling out the hair and kicking the author and someone who made this movie possibly ass. I am a deployed soldier and when I use my precious downtime to watch movies like this. These people should feel awful, they had to see this before it came out and it must have been freaking lazy to recover after they noticed the freaking suck. I am so amazed that this great country of ours is letting them make another. Honestly, this is the first time I've ever commented on a movie, I had to let the world know not to waste their time. Delete this movie from this planet. It makes us people look retarded.
