There were so many things wrong with this movie, I have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the one on the ground in the bathroom, what happens if Zep never comes up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before he made it to the bathroom? Is Jigsaw simply coming up and going out? Can the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be a puzzle, but another part of Jigsaw's game? What if Zep killed wife and child, how does Jigsaw get the antidote to the poison if he is in the middle of the bathroom? Why is the doctor waiting for the last minute to finally cut off his foot? It was too late, it was after six, and as far as he knew his wife and child were already dead, it was not the best time for heroines. These are just a few questions I had about the movie, but I can miss anything or everything since I only watched the movie once. Please help!
