Let's get one thing right; This was bad! So Putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be marked on everyone's memory. The ever-repeated story (who is constantly reusing not only jokes but stories and character behavior.) A typical story goes as follows; Sue (the mother) opens the episode of quotation on how she loves her baby son, but smells awful (as if it didn't get old! Har-de-bloody-have!), Some Australian quasi-nationalist "bogans" arise saying how She thinks she's great because she's an ozzie while everything / everyone else doesn't suck until they disappear for the rest of the episode. (a little mercy) The rest of the plot is about the father (Gary), who comes in some sort of disagreement with Sue and he talks to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out. <br /> <br /> The term "words fails me" is an old one, but here is the most truthful thing to say. It's so incredibly bad! So HORRIBLE, I want all traces of its existence sent to the lowest depth in the North Sea and life can continue. <br /> <br /> However, it makes me see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good actress, I like her) make a talk of herself, Ardal O Hanlon (My Hero sideide) has the ability to be pretty funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, who is so many good things manage to somehow come up with this ... then comedy is in very serious trouble!
