This movie made me so angry !! Here I am thinking that here is a new horror movie, one with a sense of intelligence, and then the movie starts. The landscape, supply of lines, costumes, the false gore, should I continue? There are porn movies with better dialogue than this. I understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, it wasn't just indie, it was a high school book report shot with a video camera and the cast is all friends and relatives. This is a movie that was judged from the beginning. Maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium, this movie could fly. But it seems to me that someone was hanging a stone around this albatross's neck and it was sinking at constant speed.
