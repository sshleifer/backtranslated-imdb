"It's like this city has the power to suck your brain right out of your head." Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenaged girl, bored with her too-average little town. Bored it is until a woman is kidnapped, and she finds what she believes to be a trace of the poor lady's whereabouts. Now, using his precious cat `D.C. 'and a scary FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) she has to find her. <br /> <br /> The Darn Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty foolish, and it has humor that often falls quite flat. However, there are a few buds of talent in it. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance as `Beda 'was really fun. Here he is wasted as the bumbling FBI agent. He has a good scene when he mimics the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most understanding parent to live. This poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed, being arrested for fetching his own cat and being tamed by his seedy wife and still not getting angry with his daughter to cause all his troubles. I wish my old man was like that. The only really good achievement is Christina Ricci. She entertaining as it always annoyed Patti, but her occasionally very poor dialogue pulls her performance down. You can also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old lady from Wings and Cliff from Cheers, in this movie. This is a movie that all these players will probably forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really cannot recommend 1997's That Darn Cat. Some small children (under 8) can enjoy it a little, but everyone else should look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I suggest Addams Family Values, The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If a fun family movie is what you are looking for, try snow day instead. <br /> <br />
