It became apparent in the first 25 minutes to look at this that the authors really wanted to make a movie of their own length and they certainly had the whole process, but then seemed to forget the fact that it needed a decent plot! If the best they could do was have 3 of the stupid characters in the real world and have 'all sorts of entertaining capers' then they should have left well alone! I didn't even laugh, and the whole "Adventure of the Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" thing going on in the middle was very, very poor! Converted, constructed and very loose. It just seemed like a flute stop tour of everything they thought "might" work just to pull it off to a function. <br /> <br /> Full of gaps eg - the Royston Vasey characters had the authors continue to write in to save them, but Jeff managed to enter into the sub-story / timed William and Mary and era. If he could do that then why didn't they continue to write Royston himself - duh ?? And Mr. Lipp's audition? What was it for? I mean what was the point? He did it and we heard nothing else about it at all? <br /> <br /> My main point is that while I loved the series, this was a bad thought, apparently hasty project. Put it this way, the plot was so bad that if we didn't already know the characters (and as a fan I had some loyalty to continue to see), and we rely solely on the story itself, it would have fallen flat on the face ! At best, it would have gone straight to video, and at worst it would never have been made in the first place! Or maybe it should be the reverse? Really terrible ....
