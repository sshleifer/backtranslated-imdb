Sorry, after seeing the credits, I thought it would at least be a decent tribute to retirees who were retiring. <br /> <br /> The boy I was wrong. The direction and story telling in this POS is terrible. I have never been so offended by a production. <br /> <br /> I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this "movie" but have to say they were fooled. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. It's not just two hours you won't be back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may have once.
