Incredibly terrible mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went insane and left infamous parties orgies and ruthless killings in his path ... I know there are several versions of this and it is based on the 102 min, as I looked - but I can't understand how it can make a difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck! <br /> <br /> I had heard too long about the alleged "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which honestly there is not much of it - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it is the technical production amateur that really chokes here: Everything looks clean and simply as a junior film school project! Camera work is hopelessly unlucky, filled with strange zooms, unsuccessful framing and confusing pans (to and from what resembles most of a large theater stage!) Complete with a grainy inexpensive image quality. Lighting and color schemes are awful and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is or should be in the shot? Editing is the ultimate sin here, creating a confusing clutter on everything with randomly jumping cutaways, continuity errors, and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There may be interesting dialogue and an equally interesting historical story ... but these mistakes distract so much that it is tragic. A story with so many possibilities to be fantastic is just a gigantic, burned (and Fellini-like) turkey that is good only for a few gobble laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I would like to lens them all one by one and ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this? There I have wasted enough lines on one of the really worst movies of all time! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
