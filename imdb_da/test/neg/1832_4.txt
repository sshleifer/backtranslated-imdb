1. watched 6/24/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK thriller, but a little too predictable. This story is based in Germany, which is also where the film is made. It's about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premiere school in Heidelberg and arrives to see some strange things arise. Someone she met on the train there and rescued, appears on the school's experimental table and she suspects foul play right away. She is doing some research, and her girlfriend disappears into a secret society called AAA (and no, it is not Alcoholics Anonymous) that has anything to do with the anti-hippocratic oath and is used to conducting experiments on living people that the doctor wouldn't normally do. She finds out her grandfather (who was the dean of the school) was a big part of setting it up, and it's pretty easy filled with members of the school. It's an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on, and then it's a kind of horror movie with the heroine struggling for the bad boy in the group taking things to the next psychotic level . Although this film was made in Europe, it plays to a young American audience focusing on the gore, sex and horror movie premise (which is really the big downturn) and explains why it probably made good money and created a sequel, but does it Don't necessarily create a good movie.
