I don't understand people here. The film is neither as good nor as bad as some say here. Except for De Kok, the play is OK. The problem with the movie is mainly the script. The signs are not credible. Sex is done okay, but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense. The movie doesn't look good, but what do you expect? The movie was shot for very little money on video. Of course it doesn't look as good as a normal movie, duh! The only thing I agree with is that the music is bad. It sounds like a cheap soft erotic movie from the 80s. The movie is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit to withdraw this without money.
