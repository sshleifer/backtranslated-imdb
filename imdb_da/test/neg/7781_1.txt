If you want a complete waste of time because you pull the ribbon out of your navel or clean the adult out of your ears or groove your tile, your idea of ​​a carnival thrill ride is so you will not miss it. <br /> <br /> For one thing, forget about the VHS cover. NO body in this movie looks so attractive (ie the Indian girl). Someone else commented that the person who provided the cover is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. To put this in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds into the movie, I knew I had been ripped off. <br /> <br /> I had finished seeing it because 1) I paid 99 cents after all, and 2) there was possibly thought to be a harehul a scene in this turkey was worth more than a pinched loaf. <br /> <br /> There wasn't. <br /> <br /> Good grief, Fonda. I know you were tough on roles when you did this, but it's under you.
