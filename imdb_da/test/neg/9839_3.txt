It's a shame for a movie with such good filmography as this one had no reason to be supported by Sarah Cawley (film) and Adam Lichtenstein (Movie Editing), and above all no sense of what is going on in Mexico City. The film tries to be a very realistic portrayal of life in the city, but it is not capable of doing so. It's a shame, a lot of movies wasted. An American woman is trying to find her brother who has been kidnapped. The first story of history is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to make a better story about the trial, especially when it comes to the issues of the US Embassy staff in Mexico City when one deals with a problem like this. Compare as an example with Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar problem. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare, as an example, to Todo el Poder (1999). The movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the city's appearance and pay little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many phrases that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief. Who should believe that a Mexican patrol from Mexico City will go all out to capture the protagonists of the Mexico-US border? And that this policeman will be able to use his radio from the Mexico City border! Only the producers of this movie. It is worth mentioning that, unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, at least in these one Mexican speak Spanish.
