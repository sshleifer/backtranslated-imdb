I rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering that I like this type of movie and considering who was in it, but boy was I wrong. The action stunk, battle scenes were just as bad, and they got a few well-known people to be in it, but didn't throw anyone with actor ability to play the lead? I noticed that some people gave it a 10. Why would you ever consider giving this stack of horse **** a 10. You can say it's worth 10 for the pure comedy of it, but when you vote for a movie that should not be a comedy, you can not give it a 10 for comedy. You have to judge what it should be, and not for something that the director did not intend. Maybe some of you voted 10 because you thought it would be fun to have this crappy movie have a high rating so people would go out and rent or buy it because you find it fun to mislead people. You play with people time and money that you do not have the right to do. If the film is sucked, it gives a bad rating, if it is good, it gives a good rating, but does not lie. I gave this movie a 4 and am glad that I was able to check this free out of my library because this movie sucked and really is not worth paying a cent to see.
