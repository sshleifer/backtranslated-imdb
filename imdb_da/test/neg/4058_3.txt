"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad exercise in making a sequel over a single year. The first movie was cute, fun and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing on a basketball team is rather far-fetched, but he has defiantly pulled enough stunts to save the concept. Even human history had some explanation for it. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. And the audience is also emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now for the poorly-emerging successor. It's terrible. This is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and makes them bad. The kind that changes the main plot in a way this time plays K-9 football instead of basketball. No madder, how much time is spent thinking about issues, benefit from doubts, going into an open mind about a position you have with a movie like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to badly bad filmmaking. The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eight class. He lives with his mother and little sister in a suburb of Seattle. In the first film, human history involved him losing his father in a plane crash that the public can relate to, most knowing how to feel losing a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional plot is a little more complicated. Josh's mother is once again dating. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, may not like this at all. Why? If I were in his shoes, I would love to have an extra parent in my life, especially this lovely one. Man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother Jackie met him, he became a local vet to Buddy. Animal history is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out the school football team, Timber Wolves. The team itself resembles something from America's prettiest home videos, and can even catch a ball without stumbling or falling into each other. So when Bud shows up one day, he shows that he can play as a recipient for them and is undoubtedly the best player of the team. Buddy is extremely sweet in his football suit. Oh, he's enough to melt the heart. The dog is also the best in this movie. Too bad there wasn't enough stunts made by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever questions a dog playing a football team. <br /> <br /> There is a very bad plot about Russian circus workers who like to steal amazing animals, of course they try to catch buddy. But their weak minds are controlled by the animals and end up doing what resembles a "Home Alone" scenario for them. "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more bleak than the first one as well. The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapsticks that I must admit made me laugh at the stupid thing of it all. There are too many sequences detailing a screw ball type and too few scenes depicting the true reason why people will watch this movie - to watch a dog playing football. The performance was also rather embarrassed. I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo's presentations, but the overall working class would correspond to a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of fun moments at the end of a few football announcements, but it's not even worth mentioning. Will Children Enjoy This Movie? Maybe, but even they will get tired when the heart feels discussions become too long and deep. They will certainly complain that the dog did not get enough screen time in and loath over the fast changing script and protest against the boring notions and argue that this movie is garbage in comparison to origami al "Air Bud" as I did. <br /> <br /> I suppose they will believe the dog is cute.
