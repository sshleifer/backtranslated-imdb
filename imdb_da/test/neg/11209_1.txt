Ask a thousand people what the biggest unintentional comedy of all time is and they will almost always tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are wrong. American Ninja has these two turkeys turned down for a number of reasons, not least as a script that was clearly not thought through. Although I fully support the B imaging industry to keep slobs like Michael Dudikoff in work, some work on the product would have gone a long way. <br /> <br /> For those who give a rat the rear, my next pieces will give away significant portions of the plot. First of all, when we get some background information about the titular hero, we are told his birth date, their next family, parents, and so on, are all unknown. I don't know about you, but I expect the US Army to take a little more seriously over its employees. They also manage to boost the continuity of the dates quite effectively, although I can't quite remember which dates were up and running. This is actually one of American ninjas' less obvious mistakes. It has been pointed out before, but a common lack of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted with a large number of antagonists, the antagonists say they attack one at a time. Recent films like The Matrix Reloaded defy this convention, but almost every movie from the 1980s has screamed the audience: "Hey why don't you all attack immediately ???". Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when fighting is more comprehensive than one-on-one. The central premise was originally a joke, but in light of recent events where the US Army cannot crush a mob of rebels simply because they will not delegate to the specialists, it seems oddly ironic. Phillipino renegades steal weapons from the US Army's local branch for sale to wealthy customers. Never mind that such theft would encourage the army to give local businessmen accountability or even thought responsible, an air reaction test, that is a cheesy 1980s action movie. After all, it's fun. Part of the movie is the climatic battle. As Joe and Jackson join in posing and fighting into an art form, evil Ninjas begin to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with a previous commentator because this movie should have been called the Ninja Holocaust because I'm willing to bet a total of at least three hundred evil Ninjas bite it during the movie's running time. On the other hand, Black Star Ninja begins to battle with rocket launches, laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous tools that are not only badly thought out, they are flat out badly done. You will never see a laser beam effect that looks cheaper. <br /> <br /> Whatever the top thing, the movie is so damn serious. During the stage, when Joe meets again with his old mentor, I dare not laugh at the hideous dialogue. Not that I know any modern practitioners of Ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination has difficulty believing that they have spoken like this at all times in their history. During this mentoring, I half expect the old guy to tell Joe to prove his crew by cutting his own head with a blunt plastic spoon. In total, I gave American Ninja a 1. This is a special score in my system as it is reserved for the worst, most horrible, most offensive movies I've ever seen, or movies that make me laugh without bothering to try . American Ninja is definitely an example of the latter.
