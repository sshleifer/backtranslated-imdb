Porno legend Gregory Dark leads this cheesy horror flick who has Glen Jacobs (Kane from WWF / WWE / whatever it calls herself today) in her cinematic debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer who is forte taking people's eyes out. The reason, where possible, has a group of troubled youths tidying up the historic hotel in which GoodKnight resides and subsequently exercised by him. Hemmingway it's not. Begins as a fun dopey B movie, but quickly becomes too long-winded to be fun. Glad I went in with pretty low expectations, but even they were not met. How can you have a purses king directly and still suffer from a lack of nudity ??? for shame. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble bares her ass short
