It's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what happens to be a very waste of talents. The reason is clich√©. The management is too self-conscious and the characters are almost caricatures. One of the most disappointing aspects of this movie is Gerard Depardieu's performance in the English version (this film was shot in French and English at the same time). Although he is one of the best actors in the film, he gives them the worst results. I have to say that Bianca Gervais comes very close ... <br /> <br /> On a more positive note, I have to say that the novice Juliette Gosselin gives a great performance in both versions. Unfortunately, the only good thing I can remember about this movie ... By the way, I apologize for my not so good English ...
