This show makes me crazy. It goes against everything a family needs, even if it is meant to be a comedy. The performance is to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good location for a comedy yes, but that does not mean that it will be a good show. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever heard commodity requests from parents of children and vice versa. The only talk that appears to be in the show is the parental and sex control of children. I know that intercourse is usually a topic that often speaks of teens, but it is brought up in almost every episode of no importance to it. The one episode, I just joined, involved the parents who gave their daughter, Hilary a car, not even do you think they are related in the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how Hilary is like "their slave." <br /> <br /> The display fails most at comedy level. I haven't grabbed this show once in the many times I've tried to see it, and I'm a person who gave such movies as Animal House and Dumb and Dumber very high marks. Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and why he chooses to destroy his career by doing this piece of blanket is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Parents, make sure your children never and I never see this. Teenagers, you probably get a laugh at this just for the obvious sexual references, but nothing comes out of it, and then you feel pretty empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 Stars.
