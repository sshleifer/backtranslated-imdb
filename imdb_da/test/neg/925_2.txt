This film is a creepy attempt to appeal to a younger demographic from fourteen to twenty-four years old 'and an insult to all of them. I refuse to believe that the age group is as fast as being entertained by this unnecessary "remake". Early in the film, one of the characters proclaims "I'm surrounded by idiots". This is the decisive moment in the movie that is steadily down. full of clichés, red herring "scary" and unexplained events, the film is also full of characters that are not exactly brainiacs, a formula that is far too familiar with stupid horror movies. and the crazy "it's so dark I can't see" scenes stolen from chainsaw massacres, but just annoying, don't build up any excitement or horror. It's hard to film in the dark, and sometimes dark is a great vehicle in a movie that is supposed to be thrilled. But my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. Perhaps he would not wait for the morning because he did not care for anything other than it could cost him more money to make night scenes well, or he does not know how. who knows? Unless you've never seen a horror movie in your life, or you're two or three years old, all aspects of this movie are predictable and done before. warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. All in all, a blasé slasher movie asking the question where h * ll is adult? It was treated as a lost leader. if you get bored as possible and all other rentals are out, or you are just in the mood for a bad scary movie that is not really scary, or you want to see Paris have a pole crush through the head, move on and take a chance. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but if that's what the producers of this movie think a younger audience wants, I ask them to be deceived. a profit driven movie without attempting to achieve any kind of art or respect for the genre. You know, smart characters make for a scary movie. I think this is Collet-Serra's debut as an instructor, in addition to advertising and music videos. He has another out in 2006 called Goal 2. Hopefully his goal is to make a better movie.
