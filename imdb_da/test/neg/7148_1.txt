This screened in Sundance last night for a receptive, if offended audience. Obviously, history is worth mentioning, it is powerful and true, but does the director have to cast every role with a recognizable face? I really mean you spend your time, say "Oh see, it's the guy from 'Armageddon'" or "Hi, it's Easy Rider!" And you lose sight of history. Maybe it's the only way this guy could make his movie, but it's a bit distracting, such as 'The Love Boat' or the old Towering Inferno movies that were 'shock o' stars! '. I wish he was just told the story simply with lesser known faces. The work of the work also seems a little lazy, as if there was no thought of where to put the camera best to tell the story. All in all, I thought it was okay, but could have been really good.
