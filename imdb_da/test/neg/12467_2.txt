TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and it includes both the Affleck / J.Lo bomb GIGLI and Rob Zombie drill HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if it's a fair comparison, since TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half of even the low budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything to spoil) <br /> <br /> TART is about a group of spoiled private schoolchildren. Most of them live in super-big apartments along New York's expensive Park Avenue, thanks to their neglected parents' finances. The film highlights the speechless life of one of the students (cats) as she discards her only true friend (as an involuntary person as she was) in the pursuit of the "good life" of the crowd. Of course, it leads to sex, drugs and music that are significantly worse than rock & roll. Everything is too dramatized in the way that really bad movies are usually. Kat's first sexual experience causes her to be branded a tramp and ejected from her newly acquired circle of friends; Her first encounter with drugs causes her to be almost dumped in a trash can after her cohorts believe she must be killed by an overdose. There are no heavy-handed messages there, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> It's essentially what the "seen before 100 times" plot entails. Other minor and even less interesting plot details include a friend who steals jewelry and ornaments from all the others, a wild child who lives on the edge (and finally falls off it one night in EAST Hamptons), an anti-Semitic British chick, joining her close friendship with Kat the moment she finds out that Cat has a Jewish father and Kat's strained relationship with her single mother trying to get the cat to appreciate the privileged life she has . The thief turns out to be an impenetrably low life. The "Wild Child" is played as a toned version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears from the film after the break. The mother / daughter relationship is seen as completely unrestrained until the film's last schmaltzy scene, where she and her besieged mother have a kind of reconciliation. * yawn * <br /> *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About cast and crew .... Dominique Swain came on the stage strong with his role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly visible LOLITA and FACE / OFF. Her performances were strong enough to land her on a number of "one-to-watch" lists at that time. She was 17 at the time, and I hope they will not be the best roles in her career. If she takes some more roles like the one she takes in TART, it may very well be. <br /> <br /> I only watched Bijou Phillips in another movie (BULLY) and I swear to her that one was almost identical to the one she gave here. I'm not sure if she's not able to give varied performances, or if it was just random, her roles in the two were so similar. My guess is that the first one is true. I feel that this woman possesses very little talent for acting. Here she is the actor drained to portray the watered Hilton sister. Being so weak in performance is fantastic considering she grew up with and remains friends with the real Hilton sisters. She plays essentially a version of herself in this movie and does a bad job of it. <br /> <br /> Regarding author / director Christina Wayne ... I know nothing of her other than TART was her first, and only movie project to date. With a first effort like this, it is no wonder that the career in the show industry was short-lived.
