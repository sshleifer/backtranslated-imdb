Four young class-school girls testify to the murder of one of their classmates under what they thought was just an innocent game. The murderer is a strange young boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event are reunited under fortune conditions in the same city where it happened. They believe Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon learned that the demonic killer Milo has also returned, still a young boy, unchanged even after nearly two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover of this movie makes it look really cool (yet I still expected a bad movie to get out of it). When I pop into the DVD in my player, the menu comes up and the movie still looks cool. Unfortunately, this movie is not all that it became my excitement. The movie is your average attempt at a slasher movie, and when I say the average, like all the other small budget slasher movies, I have never been welcomed with open arms to most members of the horror community (I'm talking about you, horror fan ). In other words, you can go up to any horror fan and most answers will be "this sucks". <br /> <br /> What mistakes has the movie made? First and foremost, DVD deck art makes Milo look really dark, but they blow it all by showing the face of the movie in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very freaky character. Second, the back of the cover tells Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc. Packing their bags and moving on because Milo is so much better ... why in hell do you want to say something like that when it comes to a no - name, low budget slasher movies that have of course failed? I mean, it just raises your expectations of the movie, making it harder to impress yourself. In a last ditch effort to attract attention, there are (in very large letters) "From the creator of the Anaconda". Just show you how low they will get as much attention as possible for the movie. <br /> <br /> Gore in the movie sucks, the manager gives you some frightening angles when Milo attacks someone. The music is not that bad and I never once fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo actually is. My best bet would be that he is a zombie if anyone else knows, tell me. Be sure I won't lose any sleep thinking about it.
