As a geology student, this film shows the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the leg from the burning house, it is less than a foot from the lava, which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is seen again when "Stan" goes to save metro 4. His shoes melt to the floor of the subway, while the rest of the team just feet away from the floating lava. And to finish this monstrosity of a movie, they come up with the most illogical solution that stops a lava flow with cement K-rails. Earlier in the movie, a reporter voice can be heard that says nothing can stop the stream firefighters having tried cars and CEMENT. Sans reasoning dictates this film is a noble and gross understatement of human knowledge.
