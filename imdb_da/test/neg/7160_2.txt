This movie was highly recommended by a friend and, like a big fan of Brando, I ordered this movie from Harrods and waited eagerly for it to arrive. I have rarely been so disappointed with a movie. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the movie was simply unbearable. You will never suffer or care for any of the characters (except Brando, perhaps). The action was OK. History, what story? Maybe that's the point. After all, it's war, but I've seen far better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so boring, I kept control of my watch ... All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Don't waste your time and money on this. May I also add that this is the first user comment I wrote, I just had to let my feelings about this movie be known. <br /> <br /> By the way, my favorites are all time: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, A Flew Over GÃ¸gens Nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them yet, save time to do so. And Amadeus should be in widescreen 2.35: 1
