Silly Disney movie about a college student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. Not a bad idea, and some of the special effects are pretty good. The script is still very bad ... all the jokes flop and the play is miserable. Everyone is trying to be fun and they are not. A really boring, silly Disney movie. But it was fun watching Kurt Russell so young.
