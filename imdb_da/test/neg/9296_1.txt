This is possibly one of the worst movies I have had the pleasure of watching throughout my life. The reason is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends, and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley's character is simply stupid, but not fun at all. It is strange why an actor of his talent would be involved in such a tripe. Tea Leoni makes a fine Hillary Clinton impression everywhere to portray the very cold and uninteresting woman leader who has all the peculiar qualities of a dietary feast. Throw in a pointless and inexplicable part-plot and a horrible ring of worthy assembly and you end up wasting 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
