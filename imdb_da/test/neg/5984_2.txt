It starts to look like it can go somewhere, and the main characters quickly head into a three-ring circus with remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys the characters' characteristics. I'm a great collector of stoner movies, but that's something I wouldn't consider a valid addition. Bong Water is waste from the deepest areas of the dumpster, and I would not be caught dead with this on my shelf. I'm actually convinced that this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free American. If you are a Jack Black fan, then I would say you might think 5 minutes of the movies are OK because Jack Black continues his legacy of singing songs for retarder. I really can't say enough bad things about this movie.
