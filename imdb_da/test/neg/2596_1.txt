It's such a shame that so many people "love" the Family Guy, because it's easily one of the worst shows on television, there are many points to address here. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks: Now in Season 1 and 2, which I think was unusual, flashbacks were quite frequent and actually somewhat tied to what the plot was about and were even fun. Now season 4 and beyond is flashback's even more prevalent, and has nothing to do with the plot, is not fun and really long, boring and meaningless. Family Guy believes that the long haul scene that goes nowhere is fun when it really is bad to write. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a baby who sounds British. How fun can it be? It is not. His character is so unstable, it's incredible. Remember in the early season when Stewie was about world domination and killed Lois. Well now he has only scenes that are scary gay with Brian. From having world domination to being gay = poor writing. <br /> <br /> References: How do they manage to keep poor references to 80s TV shows or events? Well they just recycle the same old waste. You know, in 20 years, hopefully Family Guy will be canceled at the time if they still make jokes about 80's shows, it becomes even more irrelevant than it was before. Because will have forgotten. This still makes me wonder why they can't just write good episodes of quality jokes. <br/> <br /> Voting: My God, the voices of this show are so bad. Seth McFarlene should just focus on his crappy episode to write and stop making voices. All extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do all the voices. Some of them talk about 15-20 characters ... everything seems very different. But why can't Family Guy do that? Oh, it's a crappy show. Stuttering: Usually made by Peter, Stewie, Brian and any extras when talking or offended by something, they must stutter out their sentence just to try and get a cheap laugh. I can't believe that Family Guy can't even speak normally to make people laugh at their "jokes". Offensive: OK, short and simple, Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be at the forefront, but they really fall every time. Go on South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible Plots: The plotters and story lines are just complete trash can. Simpsons has started their 20 seasons, still has better plots than Family Guy. Ca. 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and drag scenes that are not relevant. <br /> <br /> Popularity Lots of little kids have Stewie shirts and think hes so much fun when they don't even get the terribly written sex jokes. They just say, "Oh, ha ha, stewie!" when they don't even get it. Family Guy has been canceled twice and brought back by DVD sales, how sad it is. They were canceled the first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season, and I honestly think it should be. These episodes were then excellent, they should be on a high note. <br /> <br /> Drag scenes and fall There are scenes that go too long. One who just sent this last Sunday went to an executive bathroom, where approx. 2 minutes was used to imitate the intro to Jurassic Park, and the plot of that episode was also stolen from a Seinfeld episode. Also a scene where Chris works in a shop and hes talking to the employee for approx. 5 minutes about a movie that also contains the stuttering. CHICKEN FIGHTS IS SO STUPID, 3 of them, each one longer than the last. useless, unfunny writing, thinking that people enjoy long scenes of fighting, between a chicken, even a chicken. Now, every time someone falls down and, by the way, no family prisoner can deny that every time they fall down, it is for a split second, and they always land with their arms over their backs to make them look funny. It has been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh jeez, everyone thinks the old pedophile is so fun when it's just a really bad running gag. they have even been in the length of giving him song pictures (which are very poor) and basing ALL episodes around him, they have done the same with other signs like the doctor I know have had an episode based on him. <br /> <br /> The Simpsons Well, not much explanation needed here. There are so many signs that family guy steals Simpson's jokes. How Family Guy Is Just A Poor Mans Simpsons. So I'm sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere, but I'm sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terribly terribly written television show that everyone seems to love when they really to go see Simpson's, Seinfeld and Frasier.
