total crap. <br /> <br /> I was so excited to see this as it is the only movie version I have seen at Mansfield Park. I suffered through the first four episodes, but when it came to the proposal scene between Henry and Fanny I hit and had to extinguish it. Anyone who uses this Sylvestra Le Touzel lady must be both blind and deaf because the woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. It's all bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I just don't know why people writing Jane Austen screens seem to be unable to give her the respect they deserve.
