Dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (like Tom Stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid (like Lisa Taylor). Mrs. Reid believes that Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, an anal reluctant Terence Stamp (like Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "house" the boss and believe that it will get him closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has a pet owl named "O.J." which becomes a toilet cokehead. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to get your limitation to "G-rated" pre-teens ready for raunchier "R-rated" fare. It will help if they haven't seen the plot before, and especially as moronic potty humor. Remember, people are being paid to act like this. <br /> <br /> ** My Boss's Daughter (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
