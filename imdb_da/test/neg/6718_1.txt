Lord, merciful! Why was this movie made? Why is Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agreed to be in it? The alien is so horribly bad in every possible way that it curls the mind. <br /> <br /> The movie has an ultra-cheap look to it. Like a budget on a few bucks was far out of their reach. What's worse is that the decision makers know this and are trying to make it seem to compensate. The result is a movie that just doesn't look right. The battle scenes are so boring and edited 'discreetly' to conceal that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them are engaging or exciting. The reason is nonsense, which does not care in the least way or has any distinctive character. The Eastern European locations (a blunt move from the producers to keep the budget down or non-existent) look uncomfortable and should not serve as a backdrop for an action movie (what action?). <br /> And what is the agreement with the title? As far as I could tell everyone in the movie was stranger. Which one does the title refer to? <br /> <br /> The DVD is in 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5.1 audio. Neither is remarkable enough to justify a single rental. The foreigner is not worth a second of your time. Gotta love that tagline tho! "If they think they can stop him, they're dead wrong." Sheesh!
