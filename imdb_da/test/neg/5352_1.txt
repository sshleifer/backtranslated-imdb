First thing first - although I think Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here) rather bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a movie must go to John Grisham's novel whose novel it is based on. <br /> <br /> Set aside an indefinite time (50s? 70s? now?), open the movie of rape and murder of a child of Rednecks, so caricatured that their purpose seems to be reassuring racists that "at least we are not so bad" ?? Cut to the evil boys arriving at the courtyard when the girls father, Samuel L Jackson, fears they will get rid of some technical, guns them down in cold blood before the trial. <br /> <br /> The setting is a "deep south" that probably never existed - the few black characters live in sheds and seem to choose cotton, the colored racers (Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version of a Klansman) are ridiculous in their villain. The set is the experiment: For the defense, they are "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey as in a coma, his assistant played by Sandra Bullock's breasts (she doesn't seem to serve other narrative purposes) and Donald Sutherland as the necessary intoxicated lawyer-who-sobers-up-to-fight-the-good-fight. For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey goes through the movements of being demonic, while in the city at large crosses burned, witnesses are scared and local citizens do not seem to break? <br /> <br /> Some of the reviews here claim the film is immoral, as it is certain that Samuel Jackson is a killer and should rely on the forces of the law instead of coming out on a faint heart-shaking piece of told by Matthew McConaughey. To be honest, it is inappropriate, although the underlying message "Vigilante justice is good" may be all about the film stinking: the characterization is pitiful, the working lead, the direction plodding, the manuscript and the dialogue are almost parody. Peter Menzies lush, 50s Technicolor cinematography is pretty but derived. <br /> <br /> And it goes for almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What's left to say? This is a waste of 141 minutes of everyone's life, it's boring, vacuumy and hammy, and almost as a reflection it's morally contradictory.
