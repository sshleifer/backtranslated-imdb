I had read online reviews that praised this unclear excursion as a combination of gory horror, quirky black comedy and borderline art-house; the movie has elements of all three, to be safe, but they are at the service of such a stupid premise (the title immediately gives away the game) ?? and amateur production to start ?? that its long-term neglect due to lack of proper distribution ?? basically until Cult Epics picked it up for DVD release a full 30 years after its launch! ?? was not a big loss for the cinema or even the genre (s). The bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demon's dalliance with a woman; yet a dying man who had made use of the sky and even painted it ends up in the wall behind the canvas (!) and gives intermittent comments on the "action". More people (from teens-to-a-fling to gangsters-in-hiding) deliver feed to the perennially-hungry bed; latest on the menu is a trio of girls ?? one of which is reminiscent of his mistress long ago, and consequently her bed fears her! See different objects ?? from cigars to pieces of fried chicken ?? and people being turned off (the bed's stomach is depicted as a vessel of honey-colored liquid) makes the film mildly entertaining at times (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeleton formation, which he seems to take a little too easily in his steps!), but also terribly repetitive, so that a whole pointless exercise in a short 77 minutes feels strained and even desperate.
