Low budget but still scary enough to keep your interest in another outlet on the well-known Frankenstein story. This film is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The prolonged Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay) fresh from medical school arrives at her father's property to find out he is still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by creating a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy evening could amplify the atmosphere. Still a fun watch.
