The evil is about a big house, where a bad spirit is foolishly released to torture everything inside. What a leaching of a movie! There is not a single scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna leaves no role. There are some animated ghosts, a disfigurement of the power saw and a ghost. After nothing, something happens to almost the entire movie The Evil being personified for ... Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary. He looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his bill. Then it's too late to turn it off because the damn thing is over. I want to throw the video cassette out of the window. Avoid this junk! Hopefully it will never see the light of the DVD and will fade into turmoil.
