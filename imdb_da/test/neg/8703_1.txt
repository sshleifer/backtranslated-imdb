This movie was horrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of Egypt, the movie has about forty. Moses was about forty when he fled Egypt, had gone for forty years and was with those who walked for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died, and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land. I realize that movies use a lot of "poetic license" since the biblical account is not so long, but if you make a biblical movie, they still need to reflect the known facts and keep the general biblical character that this movie fails this aspect and in many others. Although the 1956 version also has its problems, the theater was much better.
