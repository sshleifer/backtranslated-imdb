I vaguely remember this movie. I remember it for the one solid reason that it's the only movie I've ever gone on !! and since then I have never seen it available to rent anywhere !! I can't ruin it for anyone because I can almost remember it !! Thinking and looking at the cast seemed to be a winner, with John Landis directing, but good god, they must have been paid a whole lot for this drive !! All I can think of is that the father goes away and the family tries to look for him by trying to put a real picture into the drive of the disk. I went out after about half an hour of this. I must admit, though, I want to see if I can get a copy just to see if it really was that bad! <br /> <br /> It wouldn't surprise me if it was on all the actors' black list! I mean Christopher Lee was in this ?? The legend of all the bad guys who had been in Star Wars and Lord of The Rings ?? As I said - black film, The Stupids!
