Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. The person who shot this movie has probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. You can't see anything in this movie. It's too dark. The parts where you can see something, the camera is directed directly at a light source so you get large lenses. So you still can't see. This movie should have been a radio game or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited up and down for some kind of brittleness. Low budget movies can be made so much better than this. And low budget is no excuse for this. An editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you couldn't see anything. Perhaps decision makers should spend some of their low budget on a preview screen so they could see what they shot. The only good thing about this movie is being so dark that you can't see the horrible play. It also covers up crappy sfx. People at novice schools make better movies than this. Movies shot with handy cams look better than this.
