Killjoy 2 surpasses the first movie with just a little bit. The things that improved here were plays, Killjoy make-up and history. This is more of a gore party, it does not have supernatural elements the first one did. In this pass, Killjoy kills his victims in more normal ways, he fires them, and he doesn't shoot them with bullets that were in his mouth. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that the end was a little half assed, actually it was half, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies.Seriously, the first movie was good but the other is better.9 out of 10.
