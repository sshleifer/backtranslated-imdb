A handful of nubile young collegiate sisters decide to go camping with a professor. A giant druid will sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse coming in the year 2000, they also have to fight with cyclists, an Indian and a loch ness monster type thing. It's worth seeing in just 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (an unfortunate unsung B-movie staple) as an oboe, and the other 2 belongs to the amazing Savannah (in one of only 3 non-porn roles, she had). Both have very small roles. Everything else in the movie is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extra: Original Trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 pairs of breasts, 2 donkeys
