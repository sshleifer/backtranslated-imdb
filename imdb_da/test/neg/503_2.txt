The operative rule in the production of this movie seems to have been "never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene." This was a principle seen from the start with an interminably long depiction of the degree of the Harvard class from 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, is to introduce some of the primary characters in history and give some of their background - which is something effective when the idea of ​​the Harvard graduation ceremony is compared to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keeps going and it sets the scene for a movie containing repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothing yet worse because I found a significant portion of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. Eventually I couldn't even see this in a meeting. I came through about half of it and had to set it aside for a few days before I could retire to see how it turned out. My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame because there are positives here. The performances are generally of a high caliber, especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - scattered as it is about the ever-present mindlessness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle society's endeavor to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. There are also some amazing landscape pictures. That said, the whole thing could honestly have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all these potential positives are blurred by - again - the insane nothing that the film seems to be turning around. Seriously - 2/10.
