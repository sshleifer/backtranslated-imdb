The only reason I did not delete this movie after 20 minutes is that we already wasted 20 minutes on it ... the only one and I repeat the only effect they used is a strange capo (from India?) on a half meter wall / trash can, I mean, effects do not make a movie, but ... sheesh .... me and my friend hoped the whole movie for some real effects (a big wolf?! something!?>!?! ) but noooooooooooooooo ... all we got is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + the used pharmacy ..... and they found guns?! in the pharmacy?! I mean what in hell? Oh I forgot there was another effect - contact lances like green eyes! every 10 minutes we shouted "the only thing that can save the movie from disgrace is a huge wolf killing them all! In addition, the script was so terrible that you don't know who you want to die first, actually pray (and I think BAD!) that the "good?!" guy will die, hopefully in the beginning. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor and send letters to delete the movie from all archives in the world.
