This movie should have been called "The Eyes of Alexander" and they should have gone away with the Bogart concept altogether. The movie started with a light-hearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgical-oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it becomes a more serious thriller, where two palm-shaped sapphires are supposedly laid as eyes in a marble head by Alexander the Great, for him and seen by him just before his death. So the beads are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the greatest overcoming world ever known. Being an expert at Alexander qualifies me to say that this is entirely a fiction, but it still gives a good movie. So, the movie winds around early wretchedness and stumbles with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and the background (which I really liked) and ends with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go into a movie in '79 - '80 without anyone shark turns out to threaten the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (It has been about 5 years since I've seen the movie, so I can't remember every detail), Olympias, some street names and many others. It was fun watching the movie just to try to capture all the background details that the director (of course an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans onto them on a bed like the credits rolled off. Kind of with a nice ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many many real objects that could have been used to make this more interesting, or the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) ​​version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many travels throughout Asia (would be of invaluable value if it exists today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress) is killed too early and should have been the main character of the whole, not the girl from Mommas and Poppas ... even though she was light on her eyes. If you can find this flick, it may be worth checking out the historical stuff and seeing Olivia Hussey in an extremely fun deadpan humor early, but besides that I would pass it on to something more entertaining. <Br /> <br /> Your, Nick
