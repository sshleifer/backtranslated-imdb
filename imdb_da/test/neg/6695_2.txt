<br /> <br /> I voted in this movie, not because I'm a fan of the American high school basketball (actually I rarely see NBA games), but rather because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. This was not one of the bright shining stars in Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> In him, he didn't have much to do with justice. As Norman Dale, the new coach in a small town high school basketball in Indiana, he was not encouraged to do much acting. Basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting on the judges. I didn't find him very credible in the role of being honest. I was also unimpressed with the required romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Frankly, there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never got my attention, nor the basketball "action" that was too predictable. <br /> <br /> There was too much trouble with this movie to make it worthwhile. I never understood the depth of pure hatred that so many of the city dwellers had for Dale, almost from the time he arrived. The character development was poor, and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of child shooting baskets should we see to get the point that this is a basketball movie? There was no excitement: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory will win the big one? I realize this is based on a true story, but I think it shows that not all true stories should be a movie. Frankly, it just wasn't a very interesting movie. Absolutely a movie Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> No better than a 2/10 in my opinion.
