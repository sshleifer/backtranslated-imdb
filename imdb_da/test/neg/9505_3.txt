This movie is very hard to understand, why would the couple divorce? No reason is given, we do not know anything about their lives in Lisbon, and even nothing about Mary's work. We must only understand that a certain drilling occurred in this life. We do not even know who has taken the initiative to ask the divorce. <br /> <br /> The movie is particularly special: I didn't know the director's name before the end of the movie when I read it on the screen I understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I counted them )! It reminded me of some Japanese films, I saw in the 90s, we actually have to accept that this is the expression of another culture, even though the set is random. I don't know if this story would have looked like a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> You can see the scene's logic, but the result is a bore, yet I decided to look it to the end because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of it all. In fact, I only understood that the story of these two beings may not be over when the train leaves the station without Marie. It is getting so long! I cannot recommend this work.
