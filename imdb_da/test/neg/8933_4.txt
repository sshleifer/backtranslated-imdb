"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it is just called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has something with J.V. cheerleaders. As once said, "That's fine - more than fine - but as you get older, you have to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society requires it." <br /> <br /> "Gimme An F" has the cinema's largest JV cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller) that resembles a cute-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her "Clueless" days. Wesley hates Miller's second movie, the horrible "Teen Wolf Too" made three years later, playing a weak southern belle like Martha Smith's character in "Animal House". Personally, I admire Miller's assortment, as the two characters couldn't be more different, and she convinced both. <br /> <br /> At least Mary Ann is a naive novice cheerleader from Moline (a member of "The Lucky Ducks") who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleading instruction. She is witnessed by Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the head of the hard girl squad-appropriately called "The Demons". Jenna is protected by Mary Ann after her main rival immediately dislikes Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary Ann falls in love with Tommy Hamilton, the chief instructor. Tommy uses his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and continue, which is a problem as his only skills teach cheerleading and perform elaborate dance routines in the shower, for the enjoyment of viewers who go off with such things. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's long-standing boyfriend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirt with Mary Ann, who trusts that Tommy will not actually benefit from young Mary Ann. While these four characters are solid and their relationships have a lovely charm, the support noise is almost as weak as the material they have to work with. It's a shame because they had brought some actual cartoon help to the production, it would have been a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and terminal cheeky instructor who continues with the camp's hungry owner Bucky. And there is another couple with one thing for the characters from "Mad Max". Since nothing is very fun, you are back with only a sweet semi-romance and some good dance routines. <br /> <br /> Attempts have been made to create excitement by slowly running a final contest, but unless this is your first movie experience, the outcome is never in doubt. And there is a back story about some Japanese businessmen Bucky wants to get money from, but nowhere is it dramatic or comical. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
