Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories dealing with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of operable bordello story, where a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people into the happiness of happiness - only his attempts miss the only goal, the woman he is tormented. In the same unfinished castle, he built a group of teachers for love in a more modern history, when a woman believes in a negligible role in the role of romance, and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by putting her up with the biggest shake in group. Meanwhile fantasies a bunch of children a George Melies-like adventure of a prince who saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king who brings over the kingdom of love. The two primary themes? Life is an adventure, and life is not an adventure. <br /> <br /> Which sounds better than the movie actually is. Resnais is the type of director how often the concept is good or bad, but the exhibition is what matters; here the concept is good, but the film is quite painful to look at. Horridly tune songs, bubbly characters without an ounce of dimension, background of dangerous pastel - instead of giving your inner child an ice cone, Resnais kills it in a bucket of cake frosting. Add some French philosophies, and you get a weird witchcraft, one that doesn't bubble the bubbles and hassle, but just put it wrong in your stomach until you want to revive it. Resnais is a risk and even in his worst he can see that he is trying something that might not work with full clarity of action. In I want to go home, he manages to bypass annoying characters and ditzy set-pieces by showing some real changes and having a few moments of silence to get the breath. Here he immerses directly into a fantasy that does not really reflect imagination, only its children's space background reference. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80's pop video and more kitsch than Golden Era Hollywood musicals. The fantasies are except for childish and naive, but the film (with nudity and profanity) is certainly aimed at adults, a goal he certainly missed. <br /> <br /> However, he is close to his theme and never backpedals. If anything, this movie is impressive, simply because it is unapologetic. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
