I absolutely can't believe my colleague IMDb reviewers. Everybody praises how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "Ring" or the million of imitations that have come out in the 10 years since that movie. And some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! I do not think! "Shutter" is okay. On average, I would say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way it's original and big and "the most scary thing I've ever seen" that a reviewer said. Pooh-lee, people. This one is common. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear if I see another ghost movie where the hero tracks the ghost's past to find out why she is so angry and after them, I must scream. br /> "original"? Give me a break. You need to get out more. Or at least stop calling you "horror movie fans".
