I was a still photographer working in Europe this summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three. <br /> <br /> I made some snapshots for him, of which I was told the poster for the movie. I didn't watch the movie for years later. I thought it was bad. Too bad because the elements that went into it were convincing. Robie Porter's girlfriend was mostly as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stick and be an extra cameraman so they shouldn't shoot everything twice. I said for sure, but I had to return to NY, promising that I would be back. Alas, I never came back. One of life's unhealthy tunes. <br /> <br /> I wish I could write the pictures, I made a place. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
