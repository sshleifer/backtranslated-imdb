Wow, who is very married to this movie, and much of it deserves, but it's not the WORST movie all the time. (It's probably "Zoolander." <br /> <br /> Whether you're high on something, really full or just in the mood for a "B-minus-minus" movie that you can make fun of. Be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others said, the first part of the movie makes you think you are seeing an update to the Bram Stoker short story. Two of the protagonists are called Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is Demeter, and they are in the carpathian galaxy. You later find that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original, and he just happens on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh, and to add to the originality, this "spooky Ghost Ship" movie has another character called Ash. Sound is known? <br /> <br /> There is paper-thin character development and anachronism as the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and Coolio and Tom Lister talk about the 20th century black snake. But what really makes the movie ridiculous is the end. If that is what happens to the characters, the previous two hours have been wasted. <br /> <br /> As I said, you want a silly movie to play the "Mystery Science Theater" with, and your mind is in about the same state required to see the "Great Vegetable Rebellion" episode in LOST IN SPACE, then you can find this redirect. Otherwise, put an effort into what it is done.
