This movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what ever. I became bad for all actors and actresses who ruined their careers to be in this silly movie. the whole movie was based on how unrealistic they could do it, to do a little like that which made it even dumber. even some of the names were unrealistic. The movie is fun to see why it had 2 out of 10 stars. This is probably the 3rd stupid movie ever made. I was really made when I realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet was a kid's movie. The most disturbing thing was Danny Trejo, a scary movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were largely clean, as far as I'm concerned.
