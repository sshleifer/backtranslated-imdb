BARNYARD sucked! I saw this movie last week and it's terrible. Which bull has weeks? My 2 year old asked me if all cows have weeks and are trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more! <br /> In addition, the violent theme scared my 2-year-old. They made the coyotes fight out and this has embedded a fear of coyotes in my daughter. I know coyotes for a fact are not wild and are natural predators. The mother and son sitting in front of us shouted, "Kill him, kill him, yes," in a particular scene in the movie, how good vs evil pr. Say. <br /> <br /> It's a Lion King rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie. Steve Oederek, who has also made Thumb movies, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, is so bad! <br /> <br /> If a good Steve Oederek movie ever comes out in my life, I'll roll over naked and swallow my diarrhea and send it on Youtube.com ... Enough said!
