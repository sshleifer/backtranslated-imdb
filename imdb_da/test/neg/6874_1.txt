this movie wasted my time. I only saw part of it and I cried for the wasted time I could have spent doing something productive and useful for this earth. for anyone who has seen this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming, as the amount of black balloons that came into the ground from this piece of shit was not needed and if they came from someone else movie, I would have forgiven them. Robin Williams lowered his standards to participate for more than 10 seconds in this movie and Tim Robbins, how he went from this movie to the shawhank redemption, I have no idea. please do not see this movie for the safety of the earth. Stop releasing black balloons into the ground from a movie they should never have financed or released. Remember to burn all copies before anyone else should look at this crap.
