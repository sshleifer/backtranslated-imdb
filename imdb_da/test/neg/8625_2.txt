There are just so many things wrong with this movie. Jeff Bridge's weird accent. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to crack the password. <br /> <br /> The whole script <br /> <br /> The ending - especially the last scene when two coffee is brought to the table for Jeff and Rita and the publisher. J & R laughs and says "We don; t drink coffee anymore". Well, why did they order it then ??? Of course they did. If they didn't and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default, there would have been three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
