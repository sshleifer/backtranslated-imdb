Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be Albert Pyun's worst movie. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can't believe how boring this movie is! How was it even greenlighted? I watched this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. This is not a good bad movie, it is simply bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 (½ out of *****)
