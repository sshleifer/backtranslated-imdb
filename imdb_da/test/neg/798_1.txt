I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a movie for hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find none of these reviews helpful, and so I do not give this movie the horrible review I am about to, easily. The movie is the science fiction of the art house of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood movie star. The trailers pull you in by showing you what appears to be a coherent plot, but are actually only a small part of an intentionally enchanting series of events that will never be properly resolved. I like movies that challenge the viewer and I don't have to be donated with a plot, and so my complaint about this movie is not that it's too high. No - the movie is just awful. As the credits roll you will feel true anger by wasting your time on Cameron Diaz's tree business and a staggering plot line. Avoid.
