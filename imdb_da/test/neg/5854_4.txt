ASTROESQUE (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the title is meant ... even less an idea of ​​what should happen in this movie half the time ... yet It still kept me interested. This is low, low budget film production in line with "El Mariachi", filmed in 16mm ... and for it's worth, the shoots are very well composed and visually stylish. Directed, written by and starring cartoon writer / artist Michael Allred ... I think it's not surprising that the movie looks good. Unfortunately, some of the actors are beyond bad ... and the rest is competent at best. Allred himself comes out of the best ... but only because he doesn't actually speak much. He walks around and looks most of the time ... or runs from bile rednecks trying to kill him. The sound is also pretty bad ... almost as if it were unfinished in places ... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they had planned to use? Strange, vague science-fictional plot ... similar in tone to "The Man Who Fell To Earth" ... but most of the movie boils down to a standard run-of-the-bad-guys and kill-them-before -The -dræb-du-plot. Ultimately, for skeptical, to be successful, but not without interest in adventurous movie watchers.
