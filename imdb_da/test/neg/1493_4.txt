I was very disappointed with this series. It had lots of cool graphics and it's about it. The level of detail it entered was minimal, and I always got the feeling that the audience was patronized - there was much that seemed to me like "This is extremely cool, but we won't explain it in detail because you won't get it Let's just show you some beautiful pictures to entertain you. "The host would drop interesting sounding words such as" sparticles "and" supersymmetry "without any attempt to explain what it was. We had to look it up on Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> I know very little about superstrings (for a layman) and I found that their explanations were coincidental and could have been so much better. They could have chosen many better examples to explain concepts, but instead used the examples they used to further confuse and immerse the topic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I got sick of repetition. They could easily have condensed the series into an episode if they had cut out the entire rehearsal. They must have shown clips of Quantum Caf√© approx. 8 times. The host continued to say the same things again and again and again. I can't remember how many times he said, "The universe is made of small, small vibrating strings." It was as if they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting "superstrings are the best thing since the slices." Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant feeling of "competition" between Fermilab and CERN, clearly biased against Fermilab. This should be an education program on quantum physics, not whether the United States is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt it was part of patronizing - "The audience must see that some conflicts remain interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than that. <br /> <br /> Total 2 inches down :-(
