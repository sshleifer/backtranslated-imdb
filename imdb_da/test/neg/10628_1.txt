About the film itself, there are abundant comments. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version I've seen recently on TV. It is heavily cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is normal that the most bloody scenes are cut into German television. I understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. They not only cut "gore shots" - they have cut whole sequences, only sparse glimpses. Like, "We must attack them" - a 5 second shot of explosions in the camp - the protagonist runs away. <br /> <br /> When the attack on the island begins, it is not even possible to follow the storyline anymore. All the cuts create something that corresponds to a series of erratic, interrupted scenes that make no sense anymore. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stand to see the end after 60 minutes of this nonsense. /> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10 The German version is only worth 1/10 <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and check it out first) or forget it .
