Based on a Stephen King novel, NEEDFUL gives THINGS the intrigue and annoyance of staying in your place. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has set up the store as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role, which dominates the screen. Also starring is Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is stable and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also in support is J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best or the worst fit of the king's horror on the screen.
