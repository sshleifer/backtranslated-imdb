Yes, it's a Friday the 13th rip off, but I have no problem with that. It's a good bet, the killings aren't so gory, but a girl's actions carry the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are nicely finished, okay, sometimes you can guess how it's done. Some people have trouble using the camera, I can't see what's wrong with it. It's so strange that so many people don't like this movie, I've really enjoyed it. Of course, the script is not original, but gives me one that I think so many slashes are made in the forest. Maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've seen much deeper, I can tell you
