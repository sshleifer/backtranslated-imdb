Why oh why did I ever waste my time watching this movie? It was given to me on video by a friend and I thought I would see it, it can't be that bad for sure. First of all, the action is simply appalling and we have to believe that this is real? Secondly, this film blatantly tries to copy the Blair witch project (gab) and makes it so bad. So if you want fear of your life, I suggest a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scary. but if you just wanted a laugh then the general fragility of this movie would probably suffice. But generally I would avoid this movie at any cost or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing. the best bit? It is only about an hour and a half, thank God.
