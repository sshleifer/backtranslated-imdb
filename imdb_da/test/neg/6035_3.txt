Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in 1850's Russia. <br /> <br /> This is a bad dubbed movie, with June Foray doing some of the voices. Unfortunately, it was about to synchronize the voices to the lips because they did not match the lip flaps. Anyone who says Japanese movies are bad has never seen this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot is immediately forgettable, and then I forgot it at the time the movie ended and for me to sit and write this down. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that Reeves made in the hope of moving from action to more plot-driven kind of movies. It could have been a good thing for Reeves, but it is fatal for the audience to go through nooze parties like this, where the whole court is intrigued by very little action. <br /> <br /> In Reeves defense was a good actor, he just wasn't fortunate in picking movies that were good. They all looked good, but very few of them did not look at them in a coma for the film's time. <br /> <br /> This movie will put you in a coma. See it only if you need sleep and all the other gentlemen have failed.
