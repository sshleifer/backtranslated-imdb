How in the world does a thing like this come into my DVD player at home? How is it even packed and distributed? Is there absolutely no screening, should a movie (and I use this term resolved) have to go through before it is put on a video store shelf anymore? I'm all for DIY movie making, but come on! It doesn't give me the right to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy video camera, a horrible story, and put it together to create a heap of crap and call it a movie. And I wish people would stop using the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these types of movies. Nor are they. In no other profession would anything like this be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell your car as bad as this movie, you would take it back and say it was a lemon. If it were a surgical procedure, you would sue the doctor for malpractice. I wish I could get my time and money back after seeing this. Shame on the video stores that make movies like these. They are a rip-off to the public. Do you want "campy"? Go to any of the Friday the 13th movie (even they LATTER them) or Dead-Alive. At least it doesn't mean you will kill yourself. It is because of films like this that make people automatically unilateral independent of waste.
