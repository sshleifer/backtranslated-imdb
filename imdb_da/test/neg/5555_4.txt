Some may remember if you have seen the movie Juno a scene where Ellen Page has a praise for Dario Argentos Suspiria, her favorite horror movie. Jason Bateman's character then asks if she's ever seen a Herschel Gordon Lewis movie and he has a copy of a movie (I forget it at the moment) and shows it to her. At the time when I saw Juno, I had seen Suspiria and a couple of Argento movies, but not Lewis. Now I can see that it is not just another of Diablo Cody's pop culture "in" references, but something that is actually an indicator of the characters' taste and perhaps more subjective, how to judge them based on their taste. In other words, Herschel Gordon Lewis' reputation is maintained for many years after he finished making his gore films - and that's for a schlock-meister, no more no less. In fact, less. It is interesting to take Argento as a benchmark because both filmmakers are approaching, at least in the case of The Gore Gore Girls, and yes, any given Argento image, similar material. Where Argento is extraordinarily conscious of his craft, getting an audience wrapped in whatever little story is of the power of the movement of camera and music and style, Lewis takes the easy route to get to an audience who is with one immature script and (put it lightly) lacking direction. Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who is not interested in entertaining his audience in an actually convincing way as a horror movie, but as a side event or a brothel. He can't lead actors to a shame, he shines as if it's a porn movie, and for any one possibly clever or funny linen, there are ten who either completely stink or are too clever with half or not clever almost enough. <Br /> <br /> It is said, perhaps, as the best material thing to say about The Gore Gore Girls, a mysterious film about a detective (2nd movement Sherlock Holmes guy played by some funny Frank Kress) and a newspaper reporter (dummy Amy Farrell) examining a series of murders of go-go dancers is that it serves as a template for countless more Troma images. Perhaps it is weak praise, and it is really the best that really can be said that Henny Youngman - "take my wife, thank you!" - has a few scenes and steals each one without having to try much. It is sad as it could be the kind of image that could entertain at an awesomely bath level. But even on that score you can laugh more embarrassed about the production, some of the actors (ie the guy who plays the cop, my God) than out of any guilty pleasure. Although Gore itself is a bit of a letdown. First, it is believed that Lewis at least lives at this end and shows that these women are murdered in crazy and evil and exaggerated ways. But with the killings it all goes further than necessary; I don't mean this in terms of shock value, because that's fine. But there has to be something else to really make it a "stick" that shows women's faces dissected and the eyes gouged are fine if you are 12 and see this as one of your first "horror" movies. It will be, dare I say it, boring. Dangerous for such a "daring" so-called movie. This was Lewis's last movie until 30 years later came a seemingly worthy swan song with a sequel to a movie he had previously brought him out of his retirement from film and job creation into written books on how to do it in business. Yet he does not show what experience he had to come up with. It's not a mistake, but it could have been, and it's simply ... schlock. Take it or leave it.
