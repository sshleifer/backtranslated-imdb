This movie was painfully horrible. Most of the film consisted of people running in the woods, walking through the woods or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then, two children who discover two "terribly mutilated bodies" in the forest return to the forest the next night for a romantic trip. ????? There is no time continuity. its day, its night, its day, its really real night, its dusk, its pitch, its day. All the forest images continue like this until you think you will lose your mind. really bad. The sheriff discovers a five foot claw expression embedded in the dirt of the forest and theorises that a super big alligator might have learned to go upright. Really a stupid movie without real motivation written for the characters. Can be entertaining for young children as an alternative to really graphic things.
