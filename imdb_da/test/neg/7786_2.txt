When a BBC killer is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer should be: The gay. <br /> <br /> Who killed the sexy blonde teenager (who is also a pathological liar) on her way home from school? Let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) lets his teenage son make unchaperoned visits to his serial father behind bars? Could it be the moody son who is impressed by his father's nonsense attitude towards women? Could it be the serial killer himself who seems to be able to manipulate events from the rear bars, a la Hannibal Lecter? Could it be the mother's girlfriend, a teacher at school, whose affair with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or can it be the girlfriend's daughter who blames everyone's secrets at school, causing immense misery? No, it's none of those likely suspects. It's ... The gay! <br /> <br /> The only mystery to the viewer guess who the gay is. Of course, it can be someone, as the homosexual characteristics are shameful secrecy and a tendency to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the "normal" people. The homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's evil; Only when this person is exposed and eliminated, the broken family can come together again and things can return to normal ... whatever it is. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially past their sales date. The world could come amazing without seeing it again on the screen again, but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I suppose they will continue to come back in movies like this.
