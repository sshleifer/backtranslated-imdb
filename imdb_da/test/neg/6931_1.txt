This is a piece of Hollywood product that should never have left a movie jug. Dialogue without a plausible thought, plot without a point, staging without skill, steering without direction and action without the value of some backwater high school's freshman class games. The whole cast should have been arrested for over acting. <br /> <br /> But otherwise okay!
