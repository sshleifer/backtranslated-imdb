Hmph. Soul Plane should be a "black comedy" spoof of a well-known movie, Airplane. This movie is black comedy done at worst. Stereotypes can be fun, and many times they are. But in this picture it is disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything raw that people associate with "urban" culture today. <br /> <br /> Tom Arnold's appearance in this movie is the saving grace of this movie if it ever had anyone. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart makes a poorly leading figure here ... his appearance in this movie is likely to be annoying to many. Method Man and Snoop's appearance was by far their worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't pay to watch this movie ...
