I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which could affect my opinion of it. I've seen all the Dogme movies and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story is desperate for themes from Shakespeare's play: King Lear, but never succeeds in capturing the audience and making them caring. The directors of the actors are very loose, even for dogma style films, and result in poorly inexplicable plays. History lacks any dynamics at all, and I lost interest very shortly. There are some scenes in the movie that are there to shock the viewer, but I don't think they improved the story at all. Mifune's last song and Festen are both Dogma films, which turned out to be orderly and had good stories, so I will look forward to better Dogma films in the future. Perhaps Aake Sandgren's "An Invisible Man-Dogma 6" will turn up the quality again. For he is like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen a skilled and educated director.
