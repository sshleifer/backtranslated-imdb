This usually sounds much better in my head (so forgive me for wandering) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and will * try not to bend to call him a "hack" .... which is pretty hard) I can't likes to mock or criticize a movie before it is seen. So with caution I went to the cinema today to see 'Inglorious Basterds' <br /> <br /> Now, it would be unfair to call it a "rip-off of a rip-off". Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but it's not plot points (he takes it from every other genre of movie) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi and his long interrogation against a farmer who stores Jews in his basement. It is such an anti-climax, as the dialogue is obsolete and the result is separated one kilometer away. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously happy) audience are treated with the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (haha, that name sounds almost like B-movie king ALDO RAY .... hah ha Quentin ... keep them 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by no one other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he ever played in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern-cleared, smirking Nazi assassin. At the same time, Mr Tarantino forgets that the actual adults can be present, so assume that the teenyboys have not heard of 'Dirty Dozen'? Raines' platon is made up of (John Cassavette's looking) bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers, all of whom seek to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge pays special attention to two of these men by throwing his longest best friend (and fellow-sycophant) Eli Roth (as baseball bat-wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and I bet more than half of the QT fan boys had never heard this name before this movie) Continue the good work Tarantino, you've done about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) Continue adding them, and it can degrade the plot (or lack of?) At least cut a long (and extremely boring and long-lasting) story short, both Raine and his men ("Inglorious Basterds") and the only survivor of Chapter 1, both having separate plots for killing Hitler in the expulsion of a Nazi propaganda film in a French cinema (owned by the aforementioned survivor, now adult) <br /> <br /> Several tedious (and meaningless) conversations follow two and fro, which Pitt curls away at an audience past care Every true excitement that leads to the murder of the most deadly tyrant all the time is wasted by the directors' demand to place an 1980s David Bowie song in another world war film. <br /> <br /> My problem (and there are many) with this movie is the recurring problem I have with most Tarantino products ..... he rarely knows when to start or stop. I do not need to 'pay homage' for 'joke' (whatever it may be). I knew about Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime in the whole movie) Ennio Morricone's joking score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars. If the best you can do is the gloomy Barad Pitt, I assume you (Mr Tarantino) is the main draw here? I don't want the audience to lead the movie. I pay to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity .... NOT how to patch (time and again) endless scenes from endless movies. It is high time that fan-boys (on IMDb) have used some 'hard love' on your 'idol' (God knows if you don't ... should the studios?) The tired old argument with Tarantino worshipers is " Well, if you can do better ... do it "Let me tell you if I was a 46-year-old instructor with the (unfortunate) pull QT ..... I would want to offer you much more than one heated muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors are trying to imitate, make movies so badly by accident or due to budgetary constraints. It is a policeman over and over to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I am sure he is capable of better (but after giving him the benefits of doubt, once again .... and not least 2 and a half hours in my life .....) he may not be ?
