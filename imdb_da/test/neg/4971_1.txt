Back in 1993, Sega released a dull, unclear video game of one of the greatest movies all the time. Quickly realize their mistakes, they have handed out another version of the game and claimed it would be bigger, harder and better. Neither was. Both were slow, boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be either Dr. Alan Grant or ... a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant walk around and kill all the gentlemen guys (what are they doing in the game)? And why a Raptor kills other Raptors? Weird. <br /> <br /> Of course not learning from their first mistake. Sega really lost the ball on the original release and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, slowest and stupid platforms I've ever played.
