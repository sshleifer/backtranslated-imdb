It is beyond me why two million Danes each week sit down to watch this terrible show. The dialogue is horrible and not realistic. The signs are hollow and simplistic. There is a hard man, a hard woman and a sensitive man. In fact, the authors say they have modeled the characters of Greek mythology! Give me a break! All the characters are, of course, brilliant policemen. After seeing this show, I have longed for "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". These are brilliant shows, and the "Travel Team" is a miserable copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish TV is currently suffering from.
