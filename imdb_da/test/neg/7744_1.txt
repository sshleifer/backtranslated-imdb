Kathy Ireland: a body of God, an English face, a voice of a smear. <br /> <br /> And the actors' talented talent with calcite. If you don't believe me, check this out: "Alien from L.A." actually depends on her to trade all 9/10 of the movie! Sure, she ends up in a nice red bikini top and a dressing skirt at the end, but it's too little (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> I think Ireland plays the daughter of a famous scientist who falls into the center of the earth to find him. Along the way she falls for a guy named Charmin (yes, as the toilet paper - make your own jokes) and finds out how "Mad Max" rejects live. Did you know that people living deep in the earth have Australian accents? It didn't. <br /> <br /> It's bad (after all, it was MST'd) and also a Golan Globus production, but after all, it is said that Ireland just seems to be lost as if trying to find where the photographers are, she can make a photo shoot instead. <br /> <br /> And I don't blame her. <br /> <br /> A star. And if you insist on seeing this, do it with the sound off - save your eardrums.
