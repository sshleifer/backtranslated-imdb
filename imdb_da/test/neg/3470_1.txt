Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what to say for this made for TV movies. But I paid the money for the movie and it turned out that this movie is a disaster. The management is really very poor. But after I looked at its information here, I realized that there could be reasons for the low quality to control and produce. Maybe they didn't have the budget, but still Ang Lee Sense and Sensibility had some money, but it turned out a hit. The director of this movie did really bad work of telling the story, and the movie couldn't even stop rational continuity in itself. It keeps pulling me out of scenes. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the story line / board. The duplicate sound is also very poor. My God .... Normally I appreciate every movie because behind it lies ideas and imagination of an individual. but this time I'm just angry, "I really want to hit something hard." ... Just don't do the job if someone can't do it best. Poor art (it's not even art, what is it?) Really evil people.
