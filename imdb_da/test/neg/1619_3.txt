This couldn't have been so terribly bad as it was if not for the horrible play by Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad it wasn't even fun! His character was necessary in the movie, but why they chose this guy is beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some quality Chinese movies ..... I can suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" .... "The Story of Qui Ju" .... "Red Sorghum". ..... <br /> <br /> Everything but this! I was surprised at how many people actually rated this high! Really ... what works out of this Wallace loser is so bad that it overshadows the other good parts of this movie. This was agreed by all 6 of us watching this movie last night! Stay Clear of this piece of waste ........
