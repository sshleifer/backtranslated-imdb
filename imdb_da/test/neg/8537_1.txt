I don't expect much of ghost stories, but I expect a story to make a little sense! Is it asking too much from writers and filmmakers? When the bad guy suddenly becomes a homicidal lunatic just because a bunch of crows is starting to point to him, I have a problem spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock wanted to spin in his grave. Has anyone not learned anything in their college 101 class? A good movie has an interesting story in its roots! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: If you have desperate financial problems, move from Chicago to the middle of nowhere in North Dakota to grow sunflowers (I'm not asking you!) . If your child has serious neurological problems from a car accident, move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town that at best has a local hospital. Hire a driver to live and work with you out of the blue without checking any references when you have a teenage vixen daughter, a wife and toddlers. (I'm glad they're not my parents!) A city where everyone knows everything has no problem, lacks a triple murder, just outside the city. And of course, man's lunacy blames a poor crop of sunflowers! (Is there anything else in North Dakota?) A few days after you bought your rundown house - with huge vines growing everywhere - it reminds you of Jack and Beanstalk, a guy from X-Files, ala Smoking Man, (I am happy to see the cigarettes did not get him, i think he didnt inhale!) Just want to suddenly sneak up on you while working to offer you the selling price of your home plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you get the picture. I've seen so many good-natured horrible movies in the past month, it's just blowing me! Is it so hard to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad that at least the crowds in this boring movie turned out to have some brains! I wish I could say the same for who thinks they will make money on this celluloid piece of waste!
