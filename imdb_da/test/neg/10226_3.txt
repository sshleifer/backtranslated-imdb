No more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this movie turned out to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of the times when you are parents, asking you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. For the most part, my younger sisters liked it, but it turned out to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at the time.
