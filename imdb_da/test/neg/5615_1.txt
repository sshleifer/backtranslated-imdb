Despite a fantastic soundtrack and the presence of the still amazing Rappaport and Woods, this is another of those moronic comedies where New York throws itself to the hero in an attempt by the author and / or director to show what there is a place. Yes, there are some other things in the movie that also suck, but that's what's important. The trend for New York Independent filmmakers seems to be "I don't have to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback bit about why one guy called Wacky Jack was pretty entertaining. The script is not a story or a plot, it is a bunch of non-good scenes that are tied to each other by having the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no motive behind what signs do. Uncle Sam, has the child delivered drugs, why? If so important, why didn't Sam do it himself? Then the character leads his ass in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying. The guy falls in love with a flight case where neither of them has any reason to fall in love. The characters are a bunch of peasants for the author to move around to see if he can get anything to happen. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused or like to watch evil indie movies because they make you feel smarter than seeing bad mainstream movies, watch this. To see what a good light-hearted crime movie looks like, see Takeshi Kitano's "Brother". "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies: a lot of them suck. And a note to the instructor: Don't be afraid to excite, entertain, enlighten or entertain the audience every now and then. Being boring does not make you a better filmmaker than those who can interest me.
