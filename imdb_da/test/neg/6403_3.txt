Then this begins with at least an interesting and promising basic idea, continues the excitement of Carey in a good untypical role, but in a less than expected performance match the weak direction of Joel Schumacher with some plot holes, "detective scenes" show us the luck of creativity . If you don't have high expectations (because of the negative reviews), you might enjoy this. Eventually they give us a lesson on morality (for those who remember "Falling Down") and "Family Joy and Cure", which destroys any opportunity to be kind and find the movie that can be seen. It is clear who is the "killer"! I wonder why W.Sparrow (Carey) didn't solve the mystery from the beginning of the movie ...
