I saw this movie right in the middle as I went through a collapse. It was around 3 in the morning and I struggle with insomnia with a quick snack. It wasn't that bad at that time, but every time I tried to see it since, I can't get into it as I did that night. <br /> <br /> At that time I thought it was sweet and I loved many different characters, though they could have done better than Goran V, in my opinion. But the only thing that kept me in mind was Heather's character and her sad "engagement" to her husband, who didn't want her anymore, which made me sad and rude to her at the same time. (Considering that I was in a similar situation at that time, perhaps that was why I liked her so much.) Not a bad movie, but you should pretty much be somewhere near the character romantic to appreciate it, And let's hope you never are.
