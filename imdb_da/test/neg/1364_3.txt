Being a big fan of horror movies and always succeeding in finding something good about a picture, but this movie just kept my interest or attention. This story is about a father and his daughter and a girlfriend when his wife died a few years back. These people encounter a terrible situation in a city they stop and visit, and all pensioners in this city are up against these people and nearly kill them. This movie reminded me of a movie called "Corn of Children" because it really involves children who are presented to Satan and are his acts of terror. There are lots of chants, mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys a whole family in their station wagon as well as dolls that kill a husband and wife.
