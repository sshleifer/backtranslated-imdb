Oldboy is set in Korea and starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) who is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up and finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed and watched by his unknown hunters, but never gets out of the room. Dae-su begins training himself to avenge himself after he comes out, which he intends to do by removing the cement from the masonry with a chopstick. But before Dae-su finishes, he gets gas and made unconscious when he wakes up, Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed up and all money up. Dae-su immediately tries to find out who imprisoned him after meeting the beautiful Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), the two falling in love and with her help, Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price ... This South Korean production was co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park & ​​has received a number of glowing reviews (the kind that distributors can pick quotes and plaster them on video box) and even won the jury's Grand Prize in Cannes, while also nominated for the Golden Palm so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well, not for me it's not since I can't understand why it's so good, and I would go so far as to say that I basically hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldn't get into the story at all, I just didn't like what I thought it was slow and boring and while many out there wanted you to think Oldboy has the best shocking twist ever, I thought it was pretty plain and not so well done either. The end, when Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized, feels the brand almost as if the decision makers wanted some kind of happy ending. In almost two hours I almost fell asleep. I was so boring, the violence is pretty, and that's the idea of ​​what happens that I could imagine that most people have a problem with, rather than what actually appears. In fact, Oldboy has a very low body number of about seven and a mild sex scene, it's really not as graphic or memorable. I wasn't warm to any of the character's and & while I accept Oldboy has an okay concept and premises, it doesn't deliver and it's a movie I will never understand why so many people seem to like. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese Manga with the same name Oldboy sees the movie out there is one or two good visual moments here, although while everyone raves at a time the battle taking place in a continuous shot, I was pretty much unchallenged and believed that combat choreography was rather boring. The actual on-screen gore constitutes very little, Dae-su eats a live squid, which apparently is quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fighting scenes, a cut off hand, some teeth pulled out and there is little blood at the end. The budget was allegedly about $ 4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. The actor looks good, but it's hard to tell when the actors speak another language. Oldboy is a movie, I found an absolute task to sit through, I have nothing in between subtitles or foreign films or attention to the plot as I followed things perfectly, but I just didn't like anything & it's as simple and straightforward as the. Apparently the other in Director Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy, which also includes Mr. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005).
