Wesley Snipe's latest video movie is a horrible mess that reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is terribly written and does not take into account the low budget it is and is trying to be too wise for its own good. Unfortunately, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double that makes a lot of his dialogue and a whole tale that even comes through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy by Wesley Snipe's talent making waste like this movie, producing a tired and clearly boring performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. It has become something of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he doesn't conduct his own dialogue, but that's not something I expected from Snipes. Perhaps it is due to the producer Andrew Stevens, who previously worked with Seagal, or the director Po-Chi Leong, who is responsible for Seagal's epic bad Out Of Reach. <br /> <br /> The reason involves shady officials, terrorist coaches, soccer teams, floppy disks, and a violent chuck of lack of money. Oh and biological weapons. Now how they are connected, I do not know, but what I can tell you is that the diabolic script is quite difficult to understand and, like many of these DTV movies, like to include a twist for many. The reason is also uninterestingly told, playing out it is short with people who have shady one for them in offices and dark alleys, etc. It's all kind of "let's sit down and fade out some plot points for the sad bastards who see this movie!" The pace of the movie as such suffers because the film, despite the poor results and the storylin, has some good action scenes. As an example of how a DTV film has successfully crossed a story with a twisting nature, I give you Dolph Lundgren's direct debut, Defender. This movie had its share of phrases and complexity, but the film has a final hour of almost complete action, with Dolph under siege terrorists. The plot points are told in connection with action, on the go, while avoiding death. The movie does not stop telling us what is happening, it does not break the pace. As such, even though the plot was a bit coincident, it was more forgiving, because the action never broke up. The detonator, as for many of these films, stops everything to give us a marvelous walk through who is bad and who is not before it inevitably shifts the round in it pulled from the rear enclosure. These movies can often suffer with pacing issues. <br /> <br /> Snipes like I mentioned are pretty bland here. In the beginning he puts on a tenant as he is undercover with some arms dealers. Originally, he seemed to be enjoying himself, but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double sleeping through the role. Snipes come alive only when he is encouraged to kick ass. There are, however, some good actions here, with some quick and crunching martial arts and some nice looking shots. The movie also has a decent ticket. Silvia Colloca co-star and she is not much of an actress, but she is beautiful, with a costume screaming "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the throw throws in and out with clich√© and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Snipes have better projects lined up from now. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then he will make Chasing The Dragon, from director Chris Nahon, who did Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally, Snipes apparently directs Toussaint, a biographical drama, by Danny Glover. The future is suddenly seen more clearly for Snipes, but let's remember that he was very well paid for his DTV movies, about $ 7million a movie, possibly more. It is also fun to consider that all DTV god Dolph Lundgren makes the better films that lead themselves with the cozy Defender and the very violent and nicely executed Russian specialist, and what more does he do in a fraction of the budgets for these diabolical offers from Wesley and Steven Seagal produce. * 1/2
