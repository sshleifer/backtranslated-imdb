I don't think I can add much more to what has already been said about this movie. But I can offer a little memory from watching ST-V in the theater. On the last (terrible) scene that the camera pulls out of the camping shoot and it seems likely that the credits start rolling by one second, the audience seemed to rise together. Normally, for a movie like this, there will at least be some-die-hard fans who stop the final disclaimer. As the people filed, I do not remember hearing any laughing and cheerful skirts, only making murmurs. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a movie review in the local paper where the critic said it was so bad that only Trek fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were the most likely to tear it apart first! <br /> <br /> Favorite Worst Scene: Target shooting on a Voyager room sensor, through a periscope not less! The room should be a much smaller limit than we thought.
