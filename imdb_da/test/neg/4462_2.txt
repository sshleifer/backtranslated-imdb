If you first saw this movie with Mary of the Fourth Form, then it may be possible for the nostalgia's drop to encourage your charity. If not, it doesn't stand a chance. The young things' hipspeak are utter nonsense, people may have used the occasional word you want to hear here, but not large batches of them in phrase after sentence. It's not so much that Dracula AD 1972 blows it apart, from the moment anyone under thirty opens their mouth, it's impossible to take the film seriously, and because it's a laugh, it's not even a smile . The idea of ​​throwing Dracula in modern times is a good and worthy of a much stronger script than Don Houghton can give. The Thames and Chelsea Male are not matching to puppet flags, model tables and scared extras, but one cannot help but feel better writing would have been so different.
