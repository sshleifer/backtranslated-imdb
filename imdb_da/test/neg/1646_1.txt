This movie is one of the worst movies all the time. I'm a little upset, this movie is not on the bottom 100; it deserves somewhere at least 60 or 70 on that list. This is not just a movie I think is bad in a campy-fun kind of MST3K way; It's just bad. This is one of the few movies I really really hate. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad. <br /> <br /> So the story in this one goes that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and returns with Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the girlfriend tries to set up Shore so the girl will leave the crawl and go back to him. It ends and what is left of the audience can leave. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this movie is to have Pauly Shore mug for the camera and try to be fun; but I will say about 100% of the time he fails. Their awful inaccurate and outdated view of farms and farms is offensive, and nothing in this movie is worth seeing. If you are thinking of seeing it, don't do it. Once I saw the movie I felt like I saw it for 5 or 6 hours. If you've already seen it you have my sympathy.
