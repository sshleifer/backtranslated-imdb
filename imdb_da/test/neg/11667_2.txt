Originally, I wrote what was a sarcastic study of this pathetic piece of fertilizer, but every time I filed the notification I got "this contains a very long word that is not allowed". Also words that were not spelled were condemned incorrectly. <br /> <br /> Now, the word sentenced for long was never identified. After many attempts to eliminate words eventually I got the insidious suspicion that the IMDb page is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically. Nothing I wrote was indecent or racist in itself. But after removing all the longest words, the same message was repeated over and over again, even words that were not spelled incorrectly were suddenly considered erroneous! The PC police are everywhere.
