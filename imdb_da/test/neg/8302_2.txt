Okay, anyone who wants to see a good work of art should NOT see this movie. A sophisticated film fisherman will undoubtedly be qualified by the harsh production values ​​and the sight of seeing an outstanding actor (Joseph Cotten) head out for a buck. Mr. Cotten must either really need the money or he was too senile to realize that the movie was crap. The same phenomenon happened with Dana Andrews, who appeared in campy and horrible FROZEN DEAD late in her career. I know Andrews was in alcoholism, but why did Cotten make this mess? <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it is a recast of the Frankenstein plot. The first half of the film looked really like they were making a serious, but seriously flawless version of the original Frankenstein story. Then they inexplicably introduced a daughter. This was not a bad thing ... until then, out of the blue, they decided to stop making a horror movie, but make a soft core pornographic flick !! The change was dramatic and bizarre. It was almost as if they were saying "okay, Mr Cotten has finished his scenes and has gone home .... now ladies, STRIP!". <br /> <br /> The problem is that Each level is just horrible, except for the monster's makeup. Although it's not great, it's still pretty cold to see. But badly writing, acting and a budget of $ 17.46 interacted to make this a boring and horrible flick - such a bad throw in some nudity for the pears out there shouldn't be enough to entice anyone to see it .
