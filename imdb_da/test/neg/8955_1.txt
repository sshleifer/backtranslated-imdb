First of all, nobody with any law enforcement experience (not ER or EMT but genuine law enforcement) takes this show seriously. Walker would be drumming out of any US police force for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. In addition, he is a comic character --- no acting, incredible trite lines, no sign development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how stupid blondes really are. And Trivett is the ultimate clown in black-and-white. Come on --- if you think Walker is an inviting show without pretension, then explain why JT is treated like a hidden, always subject to Walker's jokes, it must never be the one to solve the crime and never save Walker, who should Be dead 50 times to the stupid things he does. Although it may be true that many criminals are even more stupid than the detectives who go after them (and believe me most policemen are stupid than dirt), the wise Walker comes up against never having the point that when Walker is caught, Jerken must be put in his misery. But then again the Norris produced the show as well as star in it, so how could he deliberately get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. As if six guys are waiting to take him one at a time. What a terrible series! It's more dissuasive than any of the hokey westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, though I could imagine that most of you here are too young to remember the shows. But just as they show, just as they show, Walker TR is just as insulting and simply stupid.
