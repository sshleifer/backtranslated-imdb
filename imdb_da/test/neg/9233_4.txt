I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to pass the time (couple joggers who first see jogging together than to jog with a stroller (sic!) Than that man alone ...) and to connect the characters "fairy tale" (the last scene where the girl climbs a mountain that sees the big black guy on another rock and then sees the boat with his former employer and says "Oh, a boat!") was terrible . At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the middle class, even in an excessive way. I think it's a miserable movie. If you want to see it, do it as a film school student, try to see technical aspects and problems. It will help a lot.
