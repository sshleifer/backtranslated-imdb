8 days no script, that's what the DVD tells you how the movie was made. It's shot in blurred video that occasionally is used for good effect, but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the time. It works very well and it helps a lot. But the killer shows only once for a long time, and the girls / women sit and mop, they try not to escape or do too interesting, so the whole grip stands still after approx. 20 minutes. Would have been a good card maybe even strong. They do very little even for eight days. Why? Because they had no script. How many movies are made without scripts. Not too many. I wonder why that is? How many good movies are made from bad scripts. Not too many. Why? Working against this big problem, trying the direction and doing some interesting things, but with what is really nothing. Topless girls shot in dark, grainy colorless video sitting around will hold some for a while, but not for the short but too long length. Actors again deserve praise if there was only one script. <br /> <br /> Also, the video quality or lack thereof is really low end, they are trying to use it for the benefit, and sometimes some pictures they see are from Miami Vice, the latest movie to be. But it's not supposed to compliment Miami Vice or this failed venture.
