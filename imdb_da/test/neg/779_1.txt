Maybe if you smoked enough weeds, it would be fun or would make you nostalgic for how completely unrestrained people allowed themselves to be in the early 70s. There is an innocent innocence to this movie, and the sexy is much more awkward and legible than the steely pros that do it for the cameras now. The real curiosity here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She has classic, WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League Sorority Girl. So what the fuck is she doing in this cheap, cheesy skin flick? From my vantage point, she doesn't seem to be using drugs in this movie (which can explain it), and she actually seems incredibly engaged in that part. When she sings her first song, she really seems like she thinks she's flippin 'Julie Andrews or something. I just get the feeling that this girl really believed this would be her big break or something, instead of the closest career killer that it was. Still, she is a pity sweet, and you can't believe she would be naked on the screen, much less make a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then make the real deal as a climax to the movie ( Snark). It is also definitely not a body double at all. It is our little Kristine who takes one to the team, or for the greater honor of showbiz or something. It is pretty amazing to see and it is definitely stimulating (ahem), but in a way I just wish she hadn't. It was a very beautiful, talented young girl who got some really bad advice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my guess is that Kristine Debell, where she even long ago wanted this movie to go away. She was very sweet and appealing in "meatballs". Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is.
