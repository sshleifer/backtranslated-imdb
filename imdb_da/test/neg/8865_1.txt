Let me first say that I love God horrible movies. Especially horror movies mostly. I watched hundreds of movies at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 with no pain. But this is the absolute worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off so it was so bad. It was unfunny and just plain unmatched. Give me 3 back to Manos' refutations Hands of fate or Monster A-go-go over this any day. Avoid this movie as the plaque !! Excuse me now as I face to clean them for the bad I had to see to get a decent rating for this movie. Only a decent gag in the part I was looking at was the hitmen, now an extermination couple to Hitmen Exterminators. Even that wasn't too big of a gag.
