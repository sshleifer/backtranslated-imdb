Imagine Diane from Cheers, the self centered on intellectualizing character, imagine now that she was trying to make a movie moire movie. This would be it. If you just looked at some of the pictures without sound, you'd think Hmmm ... it could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now if you turn on the sound and listen at any time at all, you quickly realize that the person who made the movie doesn't know anything about movies beyond what they read in a book. I was constantly thinking that this thing was a foreign movie, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you can't remember Cheers, think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember DeFoe character who made the horrible movie ... well imagine the horrible movie without Mr. Bean stores it. That's what this movie is. I'm not saying anything about what the movie is but it's an attempt to make a dark moody movie about a hitman going home .... at least it's all about everything I could get out of it.
