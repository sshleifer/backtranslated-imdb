This show, Paranormal State, has an almost "Blairwitch Project" feel to it. As you look at a 'documentary' that is actually just a script movie, made to look like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the show is their 'go to' outside counselors by Warren, who became famous for their "investigations" of the Amityville murders, which turned out to be totally fraudulent, just based on police reports about the death of the family! (as the oldest daughter has actually been involved in the whole thing, to the point of possibly even helping some of the deaths!) Then there is the way they are constantly jumping on to blame demons for everything. Not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. They do not want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases that get them the most pressure and attention. They are complete fraud, simple and simple.
