This is perhaps the most ridiculous crap I've ever seen. Three independent stories of completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships from a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people became involved in this. Highlights: Green refrigerator man reads Jean-Paul Sartre, the slob man's dinner guest and her fertilizer hair products, a RIDICULOUSLY unreasonable woman in the third card who suspected a man with evil games just to take an interest in his generic activities, Blowers. <br /> <br /> I need a few lines apparently so can also mention some more stupid things about the movie. The first movie involves a man driving a talking car around and obeying his unreasonable demands for absolutely no obvious reason. The only way you would look at this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating mistakes in your personality and brain. It is a little fun in an ironic way, but also extremely tiring, such as being forced to chew for a very long time on a colored rug.
