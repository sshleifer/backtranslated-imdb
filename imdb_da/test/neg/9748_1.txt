This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but the jokes aren't fun, the plot is painfully clear. Calling the protagonists stupid is to greatly upgrade their intelligence ... uggh! I just wanted to beat Tom Arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours in my life when I finished watching this movie. I don't even know why I would ever see it, but remember if you see this movie: DON'T SIGN THAT YOU WILL NOT BE LIKE YOU. <br /> <br /> PS Tom Arnold's characters are singing a song in this movie called "I'm My Own Grandpa." Nuff said.
