Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to make him play the role of a "president" and then make him act like he is James Bond and run around with a gun and go into a warehouse to uncover one plot to kill Christians, then escape the supposed high security facility to live another day, do not do him justice - this movie has so many unresolved issues <br /> <br /> I will try to mention a few: < br /> <br /> 1 - What was the purpose of storing a vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - For example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if "the crushing force" already had a vaccine at hand - later Williams's wife begins to be with the sick preacher and she gets sick herself; So was the virus contagious? - If it was contagious, why did Ray and his wife enter the church without proper protection? Why didn't they get sick either? - And when Chloe drank the wine and was "cured", how did she suddenly see that the wine was "antidote"? - Was it California wine, plain red table wine? - could red grape juice suffice - and if the preacher had received "communion" at least every time he preached, might he have had anti-dope flowing through his body already? - Buck and Chloe got a "heavy" box of vaccine that was never used - what mysterious message should we see in it? <br /> <br /> 2 - The presentation of "evil" forces working with Anti-Christ Nicolai to destroy the world, such as Russian, Chinese, etc., is truly a relic of the 1950s and early James. Bond era and showing an ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that the Russians and the Chinese are trying to destroy this planet? - And for what purpose, just destruction? - this was such a beautiful view of this world and was so clich√© as being ridiculous <br /> <br /> 3 - The main purpose of this movie was the scene near the end where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. . proselytises the non-believers in the audience (by showing Kirk proselytizing Lou) - it was a movie with no meaningful story, too many connections with reality and a totally inappropriate plot for a great actor <br /> <br /> I therefore rank this as a 1, as Zero is not available
