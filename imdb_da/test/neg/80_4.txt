A bubbly, overambitious, plotless comedy that has no dramatic center. It was probably supposed to have an epic vision and a surreal flair (at least in some episodes), but the separate stories are never elevated to a meaningful whole, and the laughs are few and far between. Entertaining end, though. (* 1/2)
