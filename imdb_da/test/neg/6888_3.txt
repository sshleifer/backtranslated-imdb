I checked out this video expecting to like it. Want to like it. I like foreign movies, I like beautiful filmography, I know critics liked this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I don't mind "slow" movies. It is beautiful. It's about the best I can say to it. The reason is very thin, the shots are very long, the gaze is very meaningful, the actors are very sincere, and it seems like a very long film. I fell asleep halfway even though it woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. It was a try, but I made it to the end. I didn't like it better for it.
