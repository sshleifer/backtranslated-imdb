It's not terrible, but what wastes ... Lousy gags, bad music, bad drawings and animations ... <br /> <br /> With regard to the impressive number of animators and interval lists on this image (from, hum .. A hundred different studios all over the world, come on, how can you expect something coherent when making an animated movie this way!) I wonder if a guy on the credits = a drawing! The lines are rough, 3d seems insufficient (I'm not against it but not in this movie) But the background is correct. The story is pretty stupid, far from the exact wisdom of BD, and apparently aimed at an international audience. Distributing a movie all over the world doesn't mean taking everyone in the world for a single guy ... A cultural object is far more interesting when challenged, even when it's a foreign movie (that's French in this case It's even worse !). Some new things are going well (Olaf character, sometimes as with the stone explanation, but it's not great), but the modern references are disturbing (music, SMS note even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird called short message service: know any imagination?). But hey, it's an M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion in it ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​subcontracting and Obelix speaks too much. Goudurix could be great (as in the book), but he is too obvious a "cool guy" with a love affair (with an uninteresting compound female character). In fact, only the Vikings (the guide except) are fun. Too much action, not enough laughing. The best part of the movie is the final credit. Not the music, but the few still pictures it contains. BD style. Well, definitely, Asterix is ​​not made to move!
