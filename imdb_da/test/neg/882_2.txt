My husband brought this home from the video store so I could see something while sitting at home ill. That kind of sick, where you could never concentrate on a book, but a sorta silly, light, romantic girl sounds right (it and a bowl of chicken soup). Now he meant well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as some others write here too) was that the house must be false ... it is not only isolated on the beach alone, but put on moorings in loose sand and so close to the sea that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in the hurricane, in the FALL), so potentially disastrous that I was sure that filmmakers simply CGI'd it all (or used movie magic to plunk a cute B&B in the surf). <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you, thanks to "teh interwebs", I can say that the house, "Serendipity" is very right, is actually close to Rodanthe and except for some window dressing and bushes , Most Shown As It Does In The Movie You Can Hire It Out Of Season, For $ 1710 A Week (Or About $ 3850 In The Summer)! Go for it! But ... interesting, the house has serious problems. The other thing that struck me "would be washed away" was "what about plumbing / electricity? And surely, "serendipity" was condemned for a break in sanitation caused by sea floods. (They rebuild.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not from "civil war". Not to mention that Viola Davis, who plays "Cliché Black Best Friend" (incredible role for a fine actress, last seen in "Doubt") is not extremely old enough for her GRANDMOTHER to have built something in the civil war! HI! It was 150 years ago! Try the Big-Great-GREAT! (In fact, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, ridiculously recently.) The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper, which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable coincidence. It is also aimed at a very panned way towards "women" - you know we women who love B & Bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks ... who dream of romance and guys that resemble Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight . Don't give us plot or thoughtful character development; just create some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes! Gere playing a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder immediately why the surgeon is guilty and not the anesthetist! HI! where's the guy Why did the wrong doctor feel guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere's come to the pout and confront the woman's husband and stay on the remote B & B ... who should be there why the only other person in the inn ... Diane Lane! She is a solitary divorce with rat children and a former hubby who wants her back. While trying to decide on it, the cliché's best black friend has her subbing as a B&B hostess. <br /> <br /> Now in the real world, the doctor will look like Ernest Borgnine ... and the solitary divorce Rosie O'Donnell. He wanted to spend his vacation by sailing 22-year-old girls on the beach while she was starving and thinking about going on a diet. But it's not the real world; I'm digging. <br /> <br /> The couple confesses to everyone, falls in love, a hurricane hits ... they love, fall in love, he must go away, he dies and she cries a lot about it. The end. <br /> <br /> I've saved you from it; Now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands, sons, lovers) from sitting through this tripe. Very tiring. Anyone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect little woman (like filmmakers seems to love throwing because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she's 45ish and not over-the-top so she is not threatening) is constantly covered by large tarp-like shawls. It would make sense if she were silly, but she is not. <br /> <br /> At least, someone throws a nice paisley shawl over this movie. So we don't have to see it. Conclusion: Read a book unless you are too sick. If you are too sick, go to bed.
