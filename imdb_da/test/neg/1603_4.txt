Yes, there is a "sleeper" to see the Sleeper Cell, and that was me. After reading comparisons to "24" (as on the DVD cover), I expected a fast speed. But no ... this series just puts together. In my cruel half-waking state, I would think, "He'll ..." and poof, that would happen ... "Guess the habit is going to roll away ..." and she goes. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwyn pursue a treasure in extreme depth? Could it be giving a little T&A? Hi, it works for me, therefore four stars instead of three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I've seen "24". Sleeper Cell, you're not "24".
