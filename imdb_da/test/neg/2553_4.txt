I must say I was disappointed with this movie. Although well-managed and controlled, the underlying story simply goes too slowly. <br /> <br /> Granted in a different mood, I would have liked it better. I laughed a lot, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of excitement to discover who won. But, unlike another movie my wife picked up on the same day (one of us hadn't heard of before), it struck in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you see lots of movies, then you can see this in every way - it is clearly better than your average fare. But if you (like me) have limited time and only want to see the best and most entertaining, save it for later. <br /> <br /> [Rate: 7/10]
