I wondered what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival had to include this movie in their program. I think they should have agreed with the others who have reviewed this movie. On the other hand, I see the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bad script, full of gaps, and dialogue is so unlikely that it is embarrassing. Ideas are introduced, so fell without development. The actress left me completely cold and effortless. The decorated decoration was appropriate on time, but a decorator's nightmare. The only way the characters could love this house is if their former home had become terrible. The ceiling looked as if the items had been thrown into the scene without attempting to create the appearance of a true ceiling filled with junk over the years. The photograph was leaned and lacked in black. Save your money for something worthwhile.
