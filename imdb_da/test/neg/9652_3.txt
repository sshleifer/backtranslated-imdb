Oh, what disappointment is this movie. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There is virtually no reason and 90% of the film is made up of different people going in and out of the screen, weak trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but at that time I simply stopped taking care while trying to suppress my yawns. Almost the entire movie is filmed with a handheld camera that is meant to convey the feeling of "personal immediacy", but there is nothing personal or immediate about most of the film. Instead, the camera's constant twitch made me seasick. To be fair there are also good shots (no saying is calculated), but nothing that makes you go "Wow!" <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the movie will go you scratching your head. If you are familiar, you will also scratch your head, though for various reasons. The film basically says and repeats again and again that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is repeatedly impeded as if anyone in the audience needed to be convinced of this fundamental historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, thousands of Polish soldiers in the other Soviet POW camps were not injured and released in 1941. It has never been sufficiently explained how many people died, even though the 20,000 figure is thrown in a couple of times. The Act is sufficient with only Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Lt. Jerzy), which gives noticeable notions, but they get to act for maybe 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more because their matinee looks forward to their ability to act, but I will not mention their names. Suffice it to say that they are definitely not the Oscar material, so any claim that this film was "robbed" by the Academy Award is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is also wrong. On the one hand, it tries to be an accurate historical drama, and on the other it is inexpensive anti-Soviet propaganda, like showing a Russian soldier, tearing the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some enigmatic scenes that have no bearing on the plot, as a couple climbs on a roof or the liquidation of Krakow University. <br /> <br /> There are many missing opportunities to make this movie more interesting, such as adding a political angle to the story or showing the German discovery of the tombs, or even depicting Anna's journey from the Soviet occupied part to the German occupied Krakow. All of these aspects could have been the bulk of the movie, but instead they are reduced to a few minutes. Eventually we get a collection of loosely fitting, confusing, boring scenes about the Poles' reaction to one of their greatest tragedies during World War II. Not very convincing and not worth the Wajda at all.
