If this is classified as "real life" in London, then the producers must be on different planets. <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, suicidal, dark, sniffing, dross on television. <br /> Everybody struggles, everything is ugly under tones that run through it, nothing is done for real reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real picture of people in London or the UK, this program is far from reality. <br /> <br /> There is no good word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a great big battle over the Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are amazing!
