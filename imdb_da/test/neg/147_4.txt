I usually watch Laurel and Hardy, but of course it's one of the movies they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team. The plot is far too simple and is mainly based on a joke; how weird kilts and scottish men are. And that's all. Okay, there are some other jokes, but I didn't find them very funny at all; they are outdated and (I think) was not very entertaining when the movie was first released. <br /> <br /> The movie still has two of the most charming faces in history and they make the best of awkward history (which I expect was filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is nice to look at. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is only worth looking at this for Laurel and Hardy fans, others should stay away from it.
