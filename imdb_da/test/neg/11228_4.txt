"Passion of Passion" is a movie that is disappointing in most cases. Where do I start from? The plot? It is desperately simplified and full of holes. The direction? Reminds of a cheap B-movie. The play? John Laughlin is utterly horrible in his role as "benevolent man of froze wife" Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as "Frost wife" Amy, and only Kathleen Turner (above average) and Antony Perkins (excellent) who get acting acting . More specifically, Antony Perkins gives a fantastic performance as pervert Peter Shayne, while Turner manages to portray the role of sexy China Blue and agile Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Turner and Perkin's lonely performances alone are insufficient to help the movie with a class higher than 4/10. See it if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although on this counter the movie can easily be matched by its competition - "Basic Instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.
