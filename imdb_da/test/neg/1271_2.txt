Opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl, and a good (not great) performance by Jannings as Henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work. Henny Gate chews nature as Anne. <br /> <br /> It's all very beautiful; but it is the whole surface and no depth. The melodramatic tale of a woman who was wrong made it a hit in America, where the expressionist "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" flopped in the same year (1920), showing that what is popular is not, what lasts. Lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies, not sterile glasses like this.
