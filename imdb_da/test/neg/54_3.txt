1983's "Frightmare" is a strange little movie. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic "30s / 40s" movie films with the shock factor of the so explosive 80s slash genre. It is not entirely successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary constraints and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors), but it still has its moments, mainly due to the classical performance (classier than the movie deserves) by late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging old-fashioned movie star (ala Vincent Price) named "Conrad Ratzoff." At the beginning of the film, we meet the old horror star as he shoots a prosthetic advertisement, and we quickly learn that ol 'Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. When you think he couldn't be more un-likable, commercial director Conrad commends to blow a roof for the seventh time, and the old goat shoots him from a balcony until his death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the midst of his speech to them and eventually ends up coming back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business relationship by smearing him with a pillow before finally kicking the shovel himself. Conrad is then rested in true Hollywood style in a high-tech neon grave with video coffins over the coffin that will play Conrad's personal video clips even for visitors coming in to pay their respect. <br /> <br /> It is at this time that the children of the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad's grave a visit in the afternoon, break into the grave and take their body home with them for an all-night party. (Not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, it's a sign of an 80's horror movie. Logic has no place here.) The kids spend the evening eating dinner with Conrad's body sitting at a place of honor that makes up with it and even dances around the room with it before you park Conrad and his coffin in the ceiling, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs Ratzoff, who is confused by the theft of her husband's body, called a mental friend to try to "reach" Conrad through a session. You can pretty much find out the rest from here. When Conrad was not a very good guy in life, it is not much of a stretch to assume that he will not be any friendlier in death. Mental Lady contacts Conrad, and he revives himself in predictably crossed fashion and then uses the rest of the movie to walk around the corridors of the students' ridiculously large house and pick the young diggers one by one. This is where the film falls apart. Infinite scenes of teens wander in empty times and say, "Hey, is there anyone there?" are interexuals with occasional outbreaks of violence (we get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figured out (WAY later than any half-intelligent people would have found out the same ... but again we are in an 80's horror movie!) that the only way to stop the chaos is to get Conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. The cramped pacing is padded with many odd lighting and dry-haze effects backed by a soundtrack that almost exclusively consists of sound effects rather than music (thunder, moans and moans, shelves, etc.), which becomes seriously annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on sennat cable back in the 80s. "Modern Horror" fans will no doubt find "Frightmare" incredibly slowly moving and greasy. However, if you came at the age of the magic decade, you can get a blast of nostalgia from "Frightmare". Fans of Jeffrey ("Re-Animator") Combs may also like to check it out as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unfortunate film students. <br /> <br /> I would advise the reader to avoid the version of this movie on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and sold in dollar transactions) because the print quality is horrible. I am told that the film has received a deluxe release through the fine folks at Troma, who seem appropriate. If you are a Troma kind of person, "Frightmare" will be right up your alley.
