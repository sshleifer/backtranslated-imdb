Committed stars (Heather Graham) with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). It is the story of Joline, who is determined to find his former husband, who is in the middle of a mid-life crisis. <br /> <br /> Commitment was not at all what I expected to lack in comedy, which ultimately was the genre. It was beyond stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck delivered a fair performance, Graham's recent roles have been lacking in gloss, and it's not an improvement. Graham's latest role was Bliss, which I also found misleading and didn't appeal to me at all. <br /> <br /> Advantages Affleck <br /> <br /> Disadvantages Predictable, Unrealistic, Poor Acting and not a comedy movie!
