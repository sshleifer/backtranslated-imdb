I give this movie 2 stars solely because of its slightly liberal plot line. Without going in too much detail. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is horrible. Really terrible - wood, low. Graffiti on the show is weak, so bloody weak that I can only wonder why they were bothering to use graffiti artists at all. It was obvious in the spray scenes that they had made other people do the 'work'. They might as well have let the actors make the painting and hide a few cents. <br /> <br /> I wanted to avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Kid loco soundtrack used to be something I listened to on my iPod, it will take a while before I can go back there for fear that this movie will come back in my mind. Avoid at all costs. Unless you think of yourself "Wow, it's been a while since I've seen a real sh * t movie ...."
