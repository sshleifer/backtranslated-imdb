I'm sorry, but I can't even partially agree with some comments on this horrible piece ... <br /> <br /> English is not my mother tongue because I'm a German citizen, so please blame me for inappropriate grammar structures or something * gg I can't understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me? This movie has no meaning whatsoever, not even a great good actor ... When I looked at the comments on The Da Vinci Code, which - I think - almost have the same rating, I had to hit my head on the table because I saw 00 Schneider directly after the sacrament, and oh my god, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> The majority of the posters in this board tear each hyped movie to pieces while assessing this crime with a film production of a 6.3 and denoting Helge as a genius. Of course, he knows how to make money, but I think the most important aspect of your opinions is that German is not your mother tongue, and you just ignore - or rather do not notice the mass of crap that is said in the sentences. OK, I have to admit that some scenes are fun, but overall a 6.3 is just too much for my compatriot;)
