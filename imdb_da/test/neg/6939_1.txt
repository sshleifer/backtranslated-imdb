For some unknown reasons, 7 years ago, I watched this movie with my mother and sister. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard with them before. This movie was so bad. How produced successors are beyond me. It has been a while since I last saw this "movie", but the one impression that it has fixed me over the years has been: "They must have found the script in a dumpster in the backlot of a cheap movie studio that is made for a "movie" and decided it didn't suck enough and made it worse, I'm pretty sure they spent the whole budget on camera work and the so-called "special effects" and then had 13 cents back to script AND to pay "actors".
