Seeing this movie for the first time twenty years after its release, I can't quite get it. Why has this been such a big hit in 1986? Its amateur droplets from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. Sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (that's not to say that Miss Rudnik doesn't have good breasts!). The song is "schrecklich". The only really fun scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing, a feature that dates the movie until the mid-eighties. It's really pretty confusing to me how uncomfortable I am to understand what sparked the enthusiasm of the happy audience in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my colleagues' IMDBers comments).
