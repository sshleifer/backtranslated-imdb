Look at the reviews you would assume, it's a classic, but once again it's just another example of bad independent filmmakers trying to drum the interest in their movie. They are not even wise about it 10/10 in the polls? I guess that to bend the curve and compensate all 1/10 is it. Is it better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, cheap and unpleasant, if it wasn't for the actors to look, you wouldn't know where it came from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people seem to have borrowed their father's camera after seeing the matrix. Less is more, but more from this team is absolutely cardboard. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also rubbish. I have no doubt that most of these people will never be heard again and that will be a good reason. I hope the zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of cardboard that I will not return. <br /> <br /> Falsification of ratings makes it only a million times worse. One reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his latest corneal transplant was successful then. <br /> <br /> See the trailer as such a warning about how bad this movie is.
