Some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and there is some kind of creature that kills them. I usually give a more detailed plot, but I don't pay too much attention to that. All in all, it was boring, and the only time you really need to be aware is during the action scenes that the director did wonderfully. The play is okay, but the characters are so boring and forgettable they interfere in your mind. You will forget who lived and who died for two reasons: 1. The killings are boring. 2. The characters are boring. The end could have shocked me more if I knew who was who. /> So you're looking for a creatures-in-cave movie? Check out The Descent instead.
