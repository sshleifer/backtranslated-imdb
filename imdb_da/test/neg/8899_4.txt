Another movie from the Swedish hillbilly country, which is always the northern part. If black people were shown in this way, there would be riots about racism and for good reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a farce and you have to laugh at the "clever" farce clich√©s. But it is most tiring. A gangster comedy with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finnish. And most stupid of all is of course the Norwegian, according to Stockholm prejudices. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one trying to make a performance that reminds us of reality. This is not fun. This is not even exciting. A burlesque too raw to make you interested in any way.
