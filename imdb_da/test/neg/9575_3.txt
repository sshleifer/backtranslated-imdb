Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a terribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to be beautiful. When she is denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she gets beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it is not long before she has left a number of organs behind her. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the phrase "as exciting as seeing paint dry"? So pretty much Satanik summarizes. During the film, one of the characters broadcasts the line, "Something so terrible, it's unthinkable." I wasn't sure if he was talking about something in the movie or the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had great hopes for this. Satanik had opportunities, but they have never been realized. On every occasion, Plot Marnie has the stupid things that can be imagined. Scripture is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so appealing and cannot carry the movie alone. <br /> <br /> Another major problem with Satanics is the direction and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that have no meaning for anything in the movie. The camera lands on shots too long after the scene is over. I can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. This group of filmmakers shows little in the way of imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I may not be familiar with the Italian cartoon that Satanik is supposed to be based on, but I'm sure it should be better than this.
