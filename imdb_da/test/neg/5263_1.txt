Kate is a young young woman who has trouble meeting and dancing guys. Throughout the film you meet several of his losers lovers. And throughout the film, you are exposed to Kate's cynical negative outlook for love and relationships. This negative view continues all the time and is presented as Ultimate Truth. I had a real problem with this. Why would anyone want to be taught about love, life, and dating from someone who is naturally so pampered? It would work if it was joke, but it is not. For the jokes in the movie (which are neither funny or original) to work at all, you have to believe what Kate says: that all relationships inevitably come with bad or no sex, that the highest level a relationship can develop into is when you is able to fire in front of your partner ... You get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no movie in the latest memory that comes close to disturbing the stomach as much as Love & Sex. Why did the filmmakers waste their time on such waste? Any joke in Love & Sex is something I have experienced in another movie or in my own life. There is nothing original or creative about the story, production or style. It is cynical, silly and meaningless. Mind numbing!
