This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera I've ever seen, it's also the worst video production I've seen in any opera. <br /> <br /> I'm a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have bird costume. He's just dressed like a guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It's saturated in orange. Most DVDs from this period have the color digitally restored, but they do not bother with this. The language has also been changed to Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie version of "The Magic Flute." It's a busy performance, and it's not a good performance, and it wasn't filmed very well. You can choose any other available DVD from this opera and I guarantee it will be better than this. My preference is for the version performed by James Levine with sets of David Hockney.
