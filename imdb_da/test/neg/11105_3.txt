Seriously, Sci-Fi must stop making movies. They are all terrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it and he couldn't help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary cheat theater in Mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The animal escapes and begins to kill crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, arms ablazin '. But they can't stop it. So they call in the fleet. They can't stop it either. Then the thing kills all 5 (or how many there are). Then the captain and his daughter count with another guy how he kills it. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, the men shoot at the slightest movement, throwing grenades on the ship, and the play is terrible. 10.3.
