An unfortunately predictable clich√© story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Unfortunately, the manuscript of the once great experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original of French exotic potboiler Pierre Louys. This time, Marlene Dietrich Concha, a manipulative, cold-hearted Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she beats him. He warns his tall young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel ensues, Concha blames Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she's ever taken care of, so he doesn't: he points to his gun in the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young victory, she goes back to the man who would be dead to her. With an unexpected piece of Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish governor. Dietrich plays a part of a Spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting her waist and posing and then twisting back, flipping, throwing her head and so on. And she makes faces and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot, except through a twisted of bare trees, no inner scene can be shot without so much detail, it is almost impossible to follow people moving over a room, no subsequent scene by Dietrich can be shot without a larger wardrobe shift. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers, it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
