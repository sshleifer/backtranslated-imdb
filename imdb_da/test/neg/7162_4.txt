This is a fine concept, and Brando is a fine piece of work. Dean Martin is not bad, and Montgomery Clift is also quite good. Unfortunately, it is a very diverse, very long piece that should really have been edited down to something closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 through the end of 2. World War and see when they discover who they are and what they can become when they discover both the world about them and what they are made of. For some it is the women in their lives who create this realization, for others it is the broader general circumstances. Yet I found myself just what had happened or what the import of a particular scene was.
