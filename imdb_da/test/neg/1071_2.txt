I don't understand what's hard to hit on this movie! I don't understand why high school kids should see this! I do not understand why it should have made me think of anything at least! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When the unnoticed girl is about to commit suicide, was I the only person who greeted her? The clichéd classic music, long traces, melancholy feelings of the film at this stage made me return to what was meant. I would only have been happy if she went into the room, and the whole cast was in there with her scissors to split their wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school .... and frankly I'm sick to death to watch movies after film in Australia with teens, based solely on horrible clichés. I have been expecting ages for a younger person to write a movie that I can relate to, and this stereotype driven piece of emo waste is what I got instead. It was like a dark version of heartbreak tall that needed a predictable finish. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in the Aussie drama depressed or have really strange issues that just aren't plausibly told? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it was more fun then "Blurred". And I needed a good laugh.
