When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just started to get out of all his old movies on video so I can see them through adult eyes. I remember really liked this one and thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that even though it is thoroughly average, I consider it one of his better movies. In a play for him, Norris plays a policeman who is haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer film. Serial killers are all rage today and people would like to think of them as a complete 90's invention. In contrast, it is good to see where the current infatuation has arisen from, of course, action films (as well as stem n 'slashers) in the 70s and 80s. While Norris is trying on both humor and any kind of human compassion, he is fisted and ridiculous, no one could kick anyone in the head like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James also, I can recommend this movie, for genre legend Billy Drago, as well as watching Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not good, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 90s.
