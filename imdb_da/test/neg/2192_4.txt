Lots of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful sets. I don't think the plot supported such huge expenses. The story could have been told much more effectively and has been more valid, psychologically, if there was not so much macho bombast in production. Chinese movies tend to be like that in my experience. And I think it detracts from the movie.
