Nothing could be more appealing than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The cool, refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American man - what could be more wonderful? Well, it's not that movie. Immediately they are destroying it by casting Kristin Scott Thomas as an American Congresswoman. It's like casting Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is just the kind of woman you don't shade in hand with greasy ex-junkies in dirty slums, or squeeze into smelly crowds and kiss babies. She would have been far better cast as the English-born widow of an aristocratic senator, the sort of the hunting club and going to flower shows, but have no idea how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> There is Harrison Ford as a regular squad. He is certainly hard enough for the role. But the idea that he will romanticize this amazingly high public beauty is a little hard to swallow. Why couldn't he have been a tough but affluent reform politician with blue-necked roots inheriting the Senate's Senate seat? The two are initially quite cool to each other, but for the sake of being Kristin is warm to him, he returns in return to show her some of the robber's side of life - what her husband protected her from. Her political awakening coincides with the screaming passion of a newer, more blue collar, lover - one who appreciates her Polish and sophistication far more than her aristocratic husband. Now it's a love story! Instead, you get an empty, meaningless "thriller", where the action draws and nothing happens. Well there is a ghetto style "drive city" scene where Harrison is almost killed, but it's so abrupt and inexplicable, it's really more like welcome comic relief. The sky is always gray in this movie, and our refined, lovely Kristin always looks a little chilled out. When she was dreaming of passion, she looked like she was dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks a little sleepy over time, as if she really wanted to sleep in bed than screwing Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that you cannot blame her.
