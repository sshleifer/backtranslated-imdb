Well to begin with, I'm just as black as black sheep, and I can tell you it's very sad when black people think a "black movie" sucks. I can't say I have ever seen a movie that is badly directed or a worse story line. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my dawg and everything, but he didn't feel this movie at all, I do not know how much they paid him to be in this bucket crap called a movie, but I hope it is enough to wash out the smell. I'm about supporting a nuisance movie, but one was bad, really really bad. It blew chucks in every aspect, no real plot, history sucked, cast couldn't act and the best there was the white guy! I almost demanded a refund on my way out of the door to the theater, half crowded up and left before it was over, I still wish I had too. Save yourself some pain and see something else, everything else ...
