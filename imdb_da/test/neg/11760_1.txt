You can't really blame the filmmaker for glorious Che because the industry is about money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are absolute trips made by the Communist Cuban government after Ches death. Che was a murderous scumbag from day one. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) Thousands of innocent Cuban men, women, and children completed to satisfy his desire for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal to the US dollar. Now it's basically worthless. <br /> <br /> 3) Continued in all things involving diplomacy, economy and military. He never made it past his first year in Medical School, and he was only in a real stroke where he surrendered with a fully loaded gun. <br /> <br /> 4) He took over the largest property in Cuba for himself. He had a yacht, a 60 "tailor-made TV from America, a swimming pool and sea views. So much to throw the materialistic lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Today, Cuba is an absolute destitute country and you have none, but Che and Castro brothers thank you for going to Cuba today, you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas, if you managed to figure out what to see would find slums, beggars and prostitutes. /> <br /> If you think any of what I say is false then go and have some study, compare Cuban exports from 1950/60 to today's, talk to people who survived or who had parents in the so-called Cuban " revolution "from the 1960s, read all the reports of murdered innocents, read the reports of people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of what evil, disgusting person he was. <br /> <br /> And please Remember to read or view EVERYTHING objectively, stop taking everything at face value and think about it.
