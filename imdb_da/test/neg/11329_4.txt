I have only seen this movie once when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both my sons are members of 45, I'd like to see it released on a DVD. I might sound a bit biased, but the 45th Division sometimes doesn't get the recognition it deserves today. The history channel always tells the other infantry divisions when it comes to World War II and Korea, but you rarely hear it mention it 45. One of the scenes that really stood out for me was when they had the Indian codecs at work and the astonished look of the German soldiers faces, as they could not understand this language. I'm glad that all the native American code talkers get the recognition they deserve.
