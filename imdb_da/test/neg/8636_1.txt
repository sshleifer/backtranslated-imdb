Skip this Hollywood version, a real piece of waste. A cheap insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos" or the English title is also called "The Vanishing". It is missing the brand in typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually because of a bunch of talented, corporate bean counters who do not have the vigilant idea of ​​something artistic, they just search for the "successful formula" and want it to apply All to win a profit. Much like the horrible "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story so much that it fits the MacDonald's crowd, it became an aberration, not even a bastardization, but a pile of goop that has been shaped the same but does not look, feel or even resemble the spirit of origin externally. Apart from that movie, at least Gary had Oldman, who is interesting to look at what he does. This dog has nothing to do with it, even the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is an embarrassment. Great tragedy is not or should never be "the evocative movie of the year", but rather takes one or more of the sadly too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader / viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a great service if you are looking for a rental and skip this grotesque waste and get the original made in a Dutch / French collaboration in 1988. It's a great movie. This is a terrible mess.
