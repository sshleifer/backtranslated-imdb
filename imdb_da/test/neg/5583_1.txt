This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> The action is pathetic. I know act is hard work and things, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Seeing these folks action is like watching Michael J. Fox perform brain surgery. It is at best shaken. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is hidden by Dan Gordon's play like Chris. Only Dan himself or perhaps his mother could believe it was good acting. <br /> <br /> The special effects of this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked as if someone was shining an orange light from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box. Sure there was a little computer animation layered over the top, but it didn't help. I suppose the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using an Amiga computer from the late 80s.
