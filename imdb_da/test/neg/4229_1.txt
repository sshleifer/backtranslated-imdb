Just had the accident to watch this really horrible movie. Think of the scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow pan on that woman. Now you have to remove the forehead, add breathing and unmarried men to the mix, and you have what all 2 and a half hours of humanity was <br /> <br /> The inspector is a sand hidden, not even a hidden, just a weak witted , slow moving simpleeton. How they ever resolved a crime is beyond me. Mandatory sex scenes are horrible and graceful. <br /> <br /> Any crook of the play (he raped and killed an 11 year old girl) is the sign very early and not surprising unless you are also dimwitted. <br /> <br /> Uninspiring camera work. <br /> <br /> The director was there and said it was up to the audience to give their own interpretation of the case. I suppose he also meant to give their own dialogue (there are bugs all - adds to their boredom level), inventive camera work (just static shots, completely stripping away the obvious beauty of the country, the movie being shot in) and plot! <br /> Really awful. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
