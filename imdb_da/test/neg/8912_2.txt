Ah yet another Seagal movie. At no less than a few months will fill the video store shelves. Hard as submerged? No. But that doesn't say much. Like perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to finish, but only goes to a final job to become the double cross of his boss. He lands in prison and is conscious of a gangster who helps him break out and seek repayment. <br /> <It's good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent, policeman or whatever he usually plays. We actually get a USA Location in Las Vegas, it seems. So, an Eastern European area as usual. There is no wire-fu either here. Then Fauntleroy does an okay job. <br /> <br /> But most of the action and combat scenes with Stevie have clearly doubled. Stems from other movies, lack of realism and logic in even the tiniest situation.Seagal and Treech make a so-so team inspirational (unintentional) laughing one minute. Sucks the rest. <br /> <br /> More notable faces come to slum it .. sleepy Kevin Tighe is a long way from his emergencies. Nick Mancuso turns out in sleepwalking fashion to take a check.No more rappers.Please? At this time, action scenes and drawings are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever. It's an outdated scene that Seagal needs to get out of or hang it up. He should have been out a while ago.
