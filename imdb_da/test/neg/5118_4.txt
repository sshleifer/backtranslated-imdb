Just Wench is another softcore parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen of the stuff out there). It has 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain) and a dorky guy whose sole purpose is to give comic relief. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I'm thinking "Cool Big looking women who have softcore lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so. This should be really good." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the manufacturers blew . There is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. There are a few false starts, but the majority of the action is only the women who make up the camera. I suppose when the producers had spent their money on the women and spent more getting them to remove their clothes, they had no money left to make them actually do anything. And I suppose they have also spent their entire assigned nudity too early, because at the end of the video there is a tremendous amount of meaningless dialogue that is obviously used for no other reason than to explain the maturity. "You are a liar! No, you are! You enter the cave! No, you go! I think we should go home! Well, I don't!" This goes on and on and on forever. <br /> <br /> There are way better things than this.
