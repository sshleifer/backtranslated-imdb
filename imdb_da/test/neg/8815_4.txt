I really tried to like "Saw." The story was good, and I admire the breakneck pace in the way the movie was shot. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that, although they might have seen "cool", they really had no meaning. <br /> <br /> Only what I liked about the movie was the overall tone of the story, and I thought the premise was amazing. The Jigsaw Killer character was fascinating and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was outstanding in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in an ungrateful role as a doctor's abducted wife. The Shawnee Smith scene was incredible, and both Wan and Whannell should be commended for using this scene as a demo to get the background of the movie. The whole idea that the Jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill himself is an excellent concept, but when the movie started, the logic began to get away. <br /> <br /> When they showed Zap was the one to hold dr. Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was evident that he was not the Jigsaw killer, and part of it. The scene where he puts a stethoscope over the heart of the scared Diana while Allison screams at him through her gag was one of the most free scenes I've ever seen. It should be chilling, but the creation of nothing. Also, when the Jigsaw killer finds a way for the victims to kill themselves, he has no problem cutting the throat of a police officer. I think it is a way of showing that he does not want to be caught and will go on any means necessary to ensure that it does not happen, but for me it just made no logic, especially when he does not indicates the death of another detective (which I liked the setup would just have been better if it was given to someone who actually deserved it). I felt Leigh Whannell was fine as Adam. It wasn't really a flashy role, and he has a lot of potential as a character actor. However, I was not too fond of James Wan's direction. The story may have been original, but the direction wasn't safe. I think I'm tired of fast MTV style cuts in favor of the old approach to steering, but many scenes involving Jigsaw killer reminded me too much of the "Se7" too much of it. As the film progressed, I began to become a series of demo wheels like "Hey, see what I can do." Instead of being exciting, it became very distracting. But hey, it worked. He now manages "Final Destination 3" so he is on his way to a successful career, and I believe he will be a top scorer in the coming years. What really did for me was the end. As I said, I knew Jigsaw wasn't Zap, and I liked how Adam discovered the mini-tape player after killing him. It would have had a great end, except for a fatal error: I felt they should have left it where you didn't know who the killer was. The way it was done was done only for one reason: Boy, are we wise? Uh, no. For me it just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Some of the better horror movies are made for a reason where there is a reason for the violence we see in history. While "Saw" started very well, it began to be enchanted by the filmmakers' insatiable need to be "cool" and degrade the winning story they had. Perhaps if they weren't too insistent on making the movies themselves and relying on a more experienced horror director to tear it down, I think it would have been the horror class that it deservedly received over the last four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of horror, I'm very scared.
