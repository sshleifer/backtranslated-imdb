Mockney comes to Brighton; In spite of a poor reception in the British press and state-financed British cinema written over it, I would rather hope that we would get some of Graham's terrible, shabby London-by-the-Sea. /> <br /> It doesn't even strive for this. Draw straight out of their clone 'n crimp trailers reproduce Guy Ritchie's types. The format looks more like a British television series than a movie (Brighton is a backdrop of gold mines, wasted with plastic study work). I watched this movie in search of a good performance by Famke Janssen ... She's a little good at this company, her big screen mark of infinity, which belongs more to blockbusters like Deep Rising. What to do (a role yourself!) The search continues. Circus is boring. 3.10
