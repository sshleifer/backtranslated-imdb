I happened to catch this movie on sennat tv. I saw the opening credits and thought it looked good. Well, I was very wrong. Though it wasn't scary bad (it had some fun and tender moments) it lacked any sense of cohesion. It started well enough with Kathy Bates'character, who has a midlife crisis of slaughter when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. But Kathy has played these crazy women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, it was the clueless script that walked everywhere. It was as if the authors had to think about what we would do next. The script also felt very distinguished. <br /> <br /> Some others who have commented on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a movie release. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it. <br /> <br /> Having said all that I thought the little woman who played Maudie was great and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.
