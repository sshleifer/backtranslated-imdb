The action was episodic, and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and move the story forward. Plotted plods together. With few exceptions (eg Graham Greene), the play was uninspired and at best pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something in their heart, except for the scene they were in. It is boring to observe a man driving a car through the peninsula in this movie's environment whether he is driving badly or well. Such scenes are typical of the voltage level in the video. So there was nothing about this video to engage or draw the observer to get him or her worried about the signs and the exit coming. I'm doubly disappointed because I rented this movie based on the executive producer (Redford) and the author of the novel on which it was based (Hillerman). I note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by PBS and Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as Carlton International. I hope this video was so disappointing for them as it was for me and my wife that they will not fund more disasters from the same source.
