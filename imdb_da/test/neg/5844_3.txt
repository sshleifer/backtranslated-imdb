A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in a movie I recently watched on television: Indecent Proposal. <br /> <br /> Incomplete proposal's two main characters, David and Diane Murphy, play Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. I'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they didn't work well, but why we should take care so much about these two staying together was outside of me. Love, love, playfulness, attraction ?? none of them materialized on the screen in their interactions together. When I knew that eventually Robert Redford would show up, it was clear from the outset that the good part, the meat in the movie, would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson just couldn't muster any feeling at all for the movie. He seemed to hold back, occupied by his retreating hairline. <br /> <br /> OK, so fast forward. Which idiots these two (Diane and David) think of, they can win back the $ 50,000 they owe by playing. There is no play there, just terribly bad, lazy, unforgiving in writing. Of course, they all lose their money. Surprised? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie) ?? a romantic, perhaps emotional frigid man, an updated gatsby. A very good role and although not a big, great actor, next to the two, Redford looks like Olivier. He immediately falls in love with Diane and we viewers once feel it. How to Love a Woman! Not David's way, trade rubber mouth to mouth with Diane on a slimy mill. (Did I see it right?) Like Gage, Redford wears a costume and tie in each scene. Yes, it is supposed to instruct the apparent brain blood audience that here is a rich man, but he also looks good even, and at this point the brain's dead audience appreciates it! Second wardrobe symbolism includes David's dusty shirts at the end of the movie, which means getting it together after a long space of abandoned wrinkled shirt wearing. <br /> <br /> And what about California garden parties depicted in Hollywood movies? Suddenly, all British appear, complete with lacy dresses, three men's hats, hats (HATS!) And of course the parasol. Yes Diane, her transformation to Richman's fianc√©e is now complete, is at the auction that allows spinning a parasol. Although she insisted that she could not be bought, she eventually gave up sexual tension. Here is where the movie branches into pure Americana. I mean, of course, David and Diane will end up together, my question is: why? Diane was sorry David, why not let her ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a good long time? How can she pull out of the sexy-romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily, just because Woody Harrelson brings her retreating hairline to the garden party, sits down and sees Demi Moore in her eyes. It's just not how it goes. He was so weak. <br /> <br /> But we must have our happy end. We must swallow the moral lesson. We are not sophisticated enough yet to get it otherwise. Director Lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juicy set, the young'uns. <br /> <br /> In addition to the garden parties, where there is a SUV, T-shirt or baseball cap in sight, such films also have a reliable public transport system that connects remote California cities and municipalities. How else does symbolizing return to the middle class or working class?
