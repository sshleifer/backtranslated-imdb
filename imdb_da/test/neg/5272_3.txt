Kevin Spacey is my favorite actress all the time, he is undoubtedly also on other people's lists when it comes to good actors. He even took a good Irish accent in ordinary decent criminal too. But Kevin Spacey, as a mafia leader? Or even a theft? I'm not so sure he could go that far. The movie to me just made no sense, and some of the story didn't feel resolved for me. <br /> <br /> Once again I know that IMDb has to make me write ten more lines. But I'm not so sure what to say about this movie because I'm still trying to figure it out. Silly isn't it? But I'm pretty sure that more than a few of you IMDb users have been in the same trouble as I'm in right now when you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to make ten lines? Wow, it should. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
