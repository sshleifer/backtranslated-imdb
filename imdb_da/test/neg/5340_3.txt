Well, it's a Monogram quickie from the dreaded period of the 40s when the poverty radio studios exclaimed a variety of horror movies that are almost incredibly bad ... So I expected the worst. The story relates to a physician who has worked in a way to restore the lives of the dead using a space filled with non-utilitarian electrical appliances that spark nicely. There is a dog's heart that hangs under a bell jar and runs perfectly, which we are informed is that his method is perfect. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precedes the inevitable death of a young man who is resurrected in a rather sub-dramatic order - uranium even with the sparks. The important plot point is that a doomed murderer is being executed at midnight, which turns out to be accurate when the young man is revived. It is not surprising that the young man is very different from his experience; apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit underground haunts and become acquainted with some gangsters ... It is difficult to explain why this whole is not completely unmatched, but it is enough enough to say it is mildly interesting and contains more murder and a few interesting characters. Towards the end, it even begins to move along with a bit of real excitement and a confrontation that is actually Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I must warn of a very, very bad end. A mark on unnecessary, pain in the butt sorta end. After the plot has solved something efficient ... <br /> <br /> You know that sort of thing ... It's all a dream. It never happened.
