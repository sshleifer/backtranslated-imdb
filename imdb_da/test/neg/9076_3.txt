Other reviews have talked about how honest this film is, especially as regards male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with his often naked actors and expect something similar, are a great disappointment. Apart from a few seconds in the judo team lockers, the two leaders side by side remain a total 15 seconds total shower. The female leader has comparatively short frontal moments. Much of this film's marketing is aimed at gay audiences, but those who expect a secret of homoerotism between the two male leaders (best friends three-way with one of their boyfriends) are most disappointed. There is not even the hint that one is interested in the other, or even hardly aware that the other is part of menagen en trois. As films, Douches Froides is curiously involved; the viewer gets very little sense of who these three young people are about how they feel why they behave as they do. Ca. one hour of the original cut was deleted It is therefore possible that the finished film seems frustratingly undeveloped. Stick with Grande Ecole, a French film that more than delivers on its promises.
