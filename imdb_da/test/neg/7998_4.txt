This is a very famous Ninja movie, but it's not a good movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some characters, you want to know some things about Ninjas watching this movie. This movie only for ninja fans and who will make nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best. You can just see ninja characters and fight in these scenes. Between these are below average, almost poor as a movie. Acting is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can't fight well. Scenario is also not good. It's so simple. Franko Nero comes close to his best old friend from army and war. He also protects him from the mafia, but he has sex (goes to bed) with his wife, and his friend knows it, but doesn't say anything to the Nero negative. Is it possible in life? What kind of friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie started a genre; Ninja movie. There is also the ninja champion Sho Kasugi, but some combat situations are not realistic and not quick even with shoo. This movie is below average even though it's a classic.
