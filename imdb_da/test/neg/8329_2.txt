You would think of a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their employer, could not help but be poignant, but then you would be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. There is no sign development. There is no redeeming visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. The study of how the relationship between the sisters develops is zero, their sexuality is never more than a grotesque, class relations shine, and the employer is a silly caricature. Thorough postures and period clothes do not make equal depth of importance.
