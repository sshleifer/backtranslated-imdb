This game is from a genre of games that tried to exploit the entire Myst-inspired trend - walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzle itself is horrible, but I stick to the play itself, which is only a little better. If you're looking for a convincing performance from any character, you won't find it here, but this game is worth buying if you can only see Christopher Walk's really hideous performance. His performance is so terrible in this game that it seems like he is imitating a person who has been imitating him. He is a caricature of his own. <br /> <br /> If you are masochistic, a Walken fan or just want to hear the F word, buy this game.
