This movie is not as good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no sign and any dialogue would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it sometimes gets quite bloody, but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when it is over the stage with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits well with the movie. They should have made a 90-minute version where they could have had some time for character development, so we can be sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some more info about morticians would have made this movie far more scary than it is. Don't expect a scary movie, but a nice, gory special effects real.
