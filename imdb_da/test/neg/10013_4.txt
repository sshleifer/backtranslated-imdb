Here is a certain average Italian post-apocalyptic hunting / killing people for the sports theme of The Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man. Certainly, the film seen here is almost not as close to fun as the other listed entrances and is also struck by poor voice over work, generally mere action sequences, a series of utterly tasteless scenes like a prolonged rape sequence and some really stupid and illogical points throughout. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the end of the movie when our hero manages to infiltrate the composition of the bad guys. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. By the discovery of the said corpse, the response is bad? (Considering that our hero has come to brutally murder all of them)? They decide to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> But I suppose to be fair, but the movie remains whether you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and make it extremely good at the presence of the always excellent Woody Strode (though his screen time is very limited) <br /> <br /> Not a classic of any kind of imagination but still just about worth seeing of Italian B-Movie enthusiasts.
