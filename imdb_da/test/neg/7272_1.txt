Finally, I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost touch with what made the original Star Wars movies look great and began to fall into the smaller tripe plot that destroyed episodes 1-3. This movie is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and wizard movies than anything worth being associated with the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, this seems to be targeted at children (and the toy market). The fighting scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips' incredible talent go to such waste, following her classic performance in I, Claudius.
