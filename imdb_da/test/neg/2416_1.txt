There are good bad movies and bad-bad movies and cozy bad movies ... this is not one of them. This is a movie that is not aware of how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of "Grindhouse Cinema" this theater sets every month. Hopefully Eric Caiden presents co. & Co. will think twice before letting author / instructor Lawrenece fold anywhere near them again. What a con man. The guy came up to speak before the movie - you would think he was Orson Welles who spoke of "Touch of Evil" or another lost classic. Almost. Good by him taking 20 minutes of audience time with his incoherent hike. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish", but if you expect something like imitations like "The Revenge of the North" or "The Exterminator" you want Be in for a sad disappointment. The script gives zero sense. The direction is so bad that the actors are so embarrassing and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is a car burst? <br /> <br /> Poor Richard "shaft" Roundtree. In this movie he plays another character with the first name "John", but it is about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic. I hope this movie allowed him to pay the rent for another month. Other actors that look like they wanted to be elsewhere included Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time. Even the audience did not think it into it (except for the one spazz boy who was sitting in the back, shouting "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the passion of a lobotomized speaker Barbie every time he opened his mouth). <br /> <br /> For real movies about vigilantes, I suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death Want I, II, III, Exterminator I, Vigilante Force, Ms 45, Rolling Thunder, The No- Mercy Man (the latter two are a couple of films presented at this theater a few years ago - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors", but both were a million times better!)
