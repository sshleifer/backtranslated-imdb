Have you ever thought of having seen a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, it's so cold! We have to make a splatter horror film ourselves someday soon. I bet it's not that hard as it seems "? Well, it must have been what went through the minds of the young Campbell brothers back in 2003, probably right after seeing Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" or a similar independent horror classic. However, this "Demon Summer" is so bad that it is embarrassing! These young amateur filmmakers, of course, cultivate the horror genre and know their classics, but they are hardly talented. I've seen a lot of miserable B-movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but this is honestly one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. And it is quite sad to be this open-hearted, because the whole cast and the crew clearly had good intentions. There is virtually no script at all. A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum, and while reading some passages of it, one of them mutates into a fierce demon who begins to kill members of all the different teen groups: dorks, hot Catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. It's all about it, except of course for all the mandatory clich√©s that the hot girl falls to the biggest dork, etc. The performances are very painful to listen to, and none of these annoying teens use imitation! They just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. I hate it! Some of the make-up effects are externally decent but still not spectacular, and the soundtrack contains some of the most horrible punk songs ever. This movie should never have been released ... I can very well imagine it being fun to be part of the production, but it is totally untouched and does not have the least redeeming element. Not even a bit of amateur nudity, damn it!
