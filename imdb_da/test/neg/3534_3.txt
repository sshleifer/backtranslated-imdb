This is Wes Craven at his worst! This is the very worst horror if you can call it horror you will ever see, especially from one of the masters of horror Wes Craven, poor direction, bad action, bad set, bad atmosphere make it the biggest pile of waste ever! the bad guy is completely convincing, you couldn't even be sad! Gore and horror involved in the movie is ridiculous, it's just plain nonsense! The only good point I can think of is that the stars Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but not even they threw, could stop this from sprouting out of control and to one of the worst horrors ever. If you still don't see it yet, don't bother, you'll just hate it.
