There are times when I begin to wonder less than halfway through a movie about what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn each reel's recordings and instead release a movie that has no real profit from any kind. And I mean something. This movie doesn't even hold up as made-for-cable porn. In fact, the tears of heaven are complete and completely dull, and sometimes a little disturbing in its naive. The girl, who, as I recall the eighteen, masturbates while thinking of an older Nazi who hit her with a car - "bumping into the hall as a way to introduce ourselves" syndrome from sitcom's and Robert Zemeki's films. Then at their second or third meeting - get it - he is shy, the one who is resistant to the girl's sexual progress, and yet all she has to say is "I'm old enough. I want," and he takes her to bed. Having slept with this girl, he hardly knows that he feels like he could die right in bed with her, and he would have lived a lifetime. It's like "Lolita" without a bunch of social and personal commentary. <br /> <br /> The camera is the most boring part of the movie. No interesting angles or originality at all, not even for the sex scenes, which should be the main feature of these kinds of movies. The masturbation scene is just a camera that circles the girl's bed (very fake look as if it is at a stage) and it is mixed with her imagination by the man taking a shower in a waterfall. The "I'm done" scene is just a close up of the girl's right side (head down to her breasts) with the guy on top of her, and that's the same shot all the time, though there are repeated cuts to a pretty independent scene of Nazi older sister who has a kind of incestuous crush on him (she is ridiculous and silly so it doesn't matter). I think it all lasts five to ten minutes, and it is neither enlightening nor arousing.
