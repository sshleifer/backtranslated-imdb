I can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creating scenes in a creative way, he depends on boring old zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed drivers have to come down the college steps of the van, he surrounds them with zombies, but none of the leaders are bitten. He can't be bothered to lead a decent battle scene so we see the leaders pushing down the stairs. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the zombies strive and in others they run like the wind. This is really practical for the instructor because he can create something he likes without disturbing the continuity of the zombies' behavior. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and much more inspiration, this movie could have been so much better.
