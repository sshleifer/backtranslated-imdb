Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary, I have seen that it was, on average, the best despite the involvement of huge stars, such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and a few others. I was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. What kept me in mind were some of the old clips of fear and disgust in Las Vegas and where Buffalo walked. Not so good for the most part because of the old guys who fell and things that every fan would already know. I still think they painted it because it could have been compressed by at least half. Still if your fan is, you will like something that has to do with hunters. Yours sincerely
