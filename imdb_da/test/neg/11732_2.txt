No no no. It's my advice to you if you want to watch this movie. Anthony Perkins is the only Norman Bates ONLY, like Janet Leigh in his role as Marion Crane. This looks just like a colored version of Psycho, with a few mildly different details thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is boring as sick Norman, and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much cowboy compared to the original. Please do yourself justice. Don't bother with this. One can only wonder what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins would think right now ....... <br /> <br /> * out of ****
