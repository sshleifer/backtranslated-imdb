I occasionally let my kids see this garbage so they will understand how pathetic the show's "participants" are. They are pathetic, not because they are obese but because they hear their dignity for a few minutes of fame and happiness. <br /> <br /> For anyone coming on National TV and blubber, sniffle and gnaw about being fat (totally their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Does it suggest that your lifestyle choices and their consequences are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> "The biggest loser" is a suitable title, but it has nothing to do with one's weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute trash can.
