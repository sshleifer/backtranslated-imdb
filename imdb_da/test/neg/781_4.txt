This is a flic that you can safely avoid. childish plot and bad action from Cameron (she really shouldn't take on these serious roles - they don't fit her) Besides, she looks most youthful, we get to see it is good in Charlie's Angels, and she was amazing in. There is something about Mary ... The Pope would not be a good US president and vice versa, my point is that there are some actors / actresses that fit a particular type of character, and Cameron is most unsuitable for this serious housewife -type - there are a dozen other actress "would have done a much better job. The movie itself is pretty incredible and juvenile in its plot (I spelled Juvinile right?) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who gave The Box a 10 rating which was dissuasive in his comments to other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and could not spell. I mean what spelling has to do with a movie review? could set tea price this movie more than those who couldn't? C'mon 'professor.
