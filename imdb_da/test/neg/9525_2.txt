Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really and regularly under par. In fact, it's kind of stinking. AKA is almost as bad as his latest (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd, distorted dialogue among the 'overclass' characters, immediately idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stuck to the core. Characterization and scripts - and sometimes the actor - are creaking as a school game ... but worse, there is some kind of peacock confidence about the direction that is just so devastating when the director has clearly not understood ... he's just not good. Diana Quick must be in cold with embarrassment. DR, you just have to get out of the movies ... seriously.
