This is a cheap-o-movie made by Al Adamson - a man who was perhaps the worst movie producer ever - perhaps even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specializes in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s, 70s and 80s and with titles like five bloody tombs, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST, it's obvious he didn't make Shakespeare !! His film had all rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> Here at BLUE BLOOD, several actors from Adamson (such as his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto) are together and had appeared in Adamsons former film, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN. It is fortunate because the previous film was so horrible and so poorly executed at all levels that BRAIN OF BLOOD can't help looking good! Of course, the makeup is ridiculous, the plot is stupid (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant) and the action is level Z, but it's still better than their last movie! About the only positive things about this movie is the aging supportive actor, the midget Angelo Rossitto actually had a better than usual part - with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot - and there is actually some sense of danger and excitement at times. As for Mrs Carrol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the throw goes through this stupid girl. But it is bad enough that it does good for bad movie fans - you just have to see makeup on the guy with acid burns and the jet gun, which seems to be made out of an old tail light!
