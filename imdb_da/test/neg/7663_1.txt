I just watched this movie on TNT and let me tell you, this movie was actually corny and cheezy. But after some time I started to laugh at my socks and to tell you the truth, they were to classify this movie as a comedy rather than action / adventure. The most hilarious scene comes when Delon and Kennedy make the 360's to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot flares out of the window to stop the heat-testing missiles ????? Dumb yet fun --- the kicker comes here though --- after a shot disappears the flare gun and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what's going on, grab this movie. The stupid parts of this movie include the total lack of plot ---- yes, we can get something into action in 25 minutes than land in Paris and go for an hour with love scenes with prostitutes and airmen. Now let's switch to the saboteur for ten minutes and then one wasted the rest of the movie and a plane that is visually broken apart, and the PASSENGERS DON'T SEE ALSO SEE IT RIGHT IN YOUR EYES !!!! - - - final rating for this move --- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it was action 2 out of 4 stars if it was a comedy
