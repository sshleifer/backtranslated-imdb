I would give this a zero if they had that rating. Fun was not fun at all. I got tired of the movie in ten minutes, but endured to the end and thought it would be better - it didn't. The others, I watched this movie, also agreed. The action was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham. The support molding was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the workers' situation being drawn on when a large company goes down, the vehicle for this would have been better served in another way. In fact, I didn't like the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I try to remember a scene where I or someone I was laughing at and can't. A worthless movie and a total waste of time.
