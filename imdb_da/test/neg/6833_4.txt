A ruthless assassin has been hired to remove someone at the top of the US government. Continuously changing his identity and location, he is only known as Jackal. Everything about this hitman is a secret. Conscious of Jackal's presence, but unsure of his purpose, the FBI's vice president faces the biggest challenge in his career. In order to track this cold-blooded killer, he and a Russian intelligence officer are using a prisoner-imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global race counterclockwise to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, The Jackal is not your movie. It is a slow spy thriller with many great gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job of playing a monstrous terrorist who helps the FBI with a deeper cause than just freedom. And Willis makes a good effort as Jackal. OK movie but no more.
