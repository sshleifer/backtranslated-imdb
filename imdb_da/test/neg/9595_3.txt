I watched this movie yesterday on a public service channel. They had announced it as a horrible movie, and then I was drawn to see it and I was not disappointed. A group of 18-19 years old goes to an excavation site on an old viking castle in Denmark to try to uncover the myth of Berserkers Vikings. Strange things happen: There is something in the forest and people are starting to disappear. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this movie, which really botheres me, is that history must take place in Denmark, where I happen to be Direct. There were so many places in the film, where the Hollywood style overlapped the Danish reality. It really made the play and the drama looks ridiculous in my eyes. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interacting with any of their surroundings. It feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark, and it removes the film's credibility. When you at some point hear that someone is speaking "old Danish", it sounds exactly like modern Swedish. Really poor research, considering the director is from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film used GPS and maps, and it is really fun because Denmark is about the size of your backyard. Nomads where you are, are never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization. And if you're at a castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see many overviews of the forests in the film, and sometimes we see what seems to be North American vegetation (?) The story did not appeal to me, perhaps because the play was so bad. When the characters see the bogs for the first time, they are not even afraid. I suppose their functionalities were insufficient to show realistic feelings. Eventually there is an unexpected twist, but it didn't impress me as I didn't really care. <br /> <br /> The creatures of the moss are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail because we get a good look at those standing in the woods when the characters arrive at the castle. There are also no really scary scenes, as Bog Creatures is almost all around. Whatever, conclusion: Unlike the facts, the movie is your typical B-horror flick. I think people from other countries can enjoy it more. As long as you are not aware of reality, it does not matter. Just as I think of the USA as a big action movie set, everyone else can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle .. and some live dead people in a bog ..
