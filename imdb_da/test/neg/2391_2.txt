How better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on television? And I don't mean in the COPS show; here they are actually presented as main characters. <br /> <br /> I can't see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse sense of human tragedy. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star that Bobby Brown helped draw from the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. Why watch him? Why does Whitney stand by him, no matter how despicable he is? This couple should be unlocked and it is a shame that they make money and gain a modicum of fame from seeing the septic tank, which is their life and human waste, which is their character.
