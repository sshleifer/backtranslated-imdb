It was clear that this would have had potential in more handsome hands, but considering Uwe Boll's track record, it would have been surprising if there would have been any profit for this farce. The first 5 minutes are classic monster movies madness - even the terrible one-lines provided by GI Joe-type soldiers feel as if they were being lifted by another venture in the same genre. <br /> <br /> If you leave the movie at this time, you will be doing a favor. You have already passed all the highlights and you will have saved yourself from suffering from sitting through some of the worst acts of recent history. <br /> <br /> Next, enter the absolute rubbish talent. The leading man has the same amount of charisma that you find in the garden slug. There is a scary bit of confused romance thrown in - it feels so wrong that you can only wonder why this scene was confronted in the first place. Usually, the genre uses elements of romance and nudity to inject some humanity and sympathy into otherwise cardboard-carved characters - here it goes back on all cylinders. The effects are bad and the action is incredibly boring. Where other classics show originality and imagination in the light of budget constraints - everything seems to be used for catering. In fact, there are no redeeming features here - not even "it's so bad it's almost good" applies. It's just bad, and in a bad way. <br /> <br /> Our totally questioned the leading star at night they spent together and how she would judge him. She gives him 2 out of 10. I give the whole deal 1 (I would have gone to 0 if that was possible). Don't waste your time on this dribble, there are lots of crap cinema out there that exceed this ridiculous junk in the jungle. Oh and finally, the movie has nothing to do with the popular game Far Cry (at best it is extremely loosely based on it). <br /> <br /> Horrible, moving together!
