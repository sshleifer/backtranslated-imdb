I know: It is difficult (if not paradoxical) to be such a "credible" fantasy. But for me, there is also such a state where too much immobility disturbs or derives from my overall opinion about the film. The latter was the case for me with regard to Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about the story, but some of the actors thought I was too over-the-top. (Perhaps it was the letter, though, asking them to recite too many trite, predictable, cliched (over) reactions.) Others have said enough about the plot. I just wished it was done - and I think it could have been - more convincing. P. S: This is a FRESH comment on this movie - I just finished seeing it a few minutes ago; not a memory of years ago.
