"Graduation Day" - <br /> I bought this movie over the past week and waited for some time to relax and relax and see some "good" 80s slasher gems I got this and "Xtro" to see, never seen any of them. I just looked at it and realized that my outdoor speakers were also on. I only imagine what my neighbors were thinking when "Felony" was singing their 10 minute hit? I'm sure it was loud, and I'm sure they think I'm strange, with it and the chainsaw sounds and screams from other movies. This was a beautiful under-slasher movie, no excitement, no story, some cool deaths, almost seemed to amateur side, I usually like movies like that, but it just doesn't click with me, now I want to see "Xtro" for the first time have a margarita! /> DJ Eric Austin TX
