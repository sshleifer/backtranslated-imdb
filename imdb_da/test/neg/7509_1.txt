Once a month I invite a couple of friends to a "Retarded Movie Night". We look forward to movies that are either so bad that they are funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and only show many chests. Last night we were unfortunately having Zombie Planet as one of our films. The kinematics are on a par with what we are used to, but the play was a different story. The main role is played by a Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie wanna-be, who could not play a role in high school, let alone a LOW-BUDGET horror movie. Our indecisive heroes who could not tell if he would be bad or not were one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that I have ever had to stop early during a retarded movie night. It had the opportunity for greatness with a great twist on standard zombie infection, but they took it a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. I would not personally recommend it to any of my friends. However, it is unfortunate that I already invited a couple over last night to suffer through 80% of this movie with me.
