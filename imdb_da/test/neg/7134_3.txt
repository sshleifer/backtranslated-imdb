I liked the first Grudge. It really shot me out and it had something for it that made me see it twice. That something was missing from this successor. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really sticks to your mind. It's people who die because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. And most of the time it wasn't even scary. <br /> <br /> Plot-wise, this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she got nothing to do, and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so fast. I was also disappointed with Kayako's mother underpinning. I was thinking that she could give some way to fight Grudge, but she dies in her hands - hair? - by Kayako. It was such a stupid twist. All in all, it is hard to feel the signs that you know from the moment you die. All in the same way. And there is nothing they can do. It doesn't feel like a cruel fate waiting for them. It's just boring because you know what's going to happen. If they had anything to do with it, it would have added excitement even if they failed. If there was hope, it would make the scares more justified. Now you're just waiting for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times and it took away some of it. I was still scared during some scenes, but I was actually used to the big eye and blue face. The actors obviously understood that this would happen when they added other scary ghosts. Yes, I was afraid of the school psychologist's scene - even though I knew where it went as soon as she said "I've been in the house". A nice touch. However, Toshio was not scary at all in this movie. I was much more frightened by the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and a glossy stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me. Some of the characters seemed really unnecessary - the infamous milk scene with the girl whose name I can't even remember comes to mind. I wasn't afraid, it was just "Huh?" I'm not sure if the schoolgirls themselves were really needed. Karen could have brought the anger to the US with her. It could have killed people in connection with her life, all at the funeral or something. Yet it would have been boring to see them all die, but being introduced to so many independent people felt really annoying. Hated "I don't want to call you mother" scene. Aubrey's mother problems were just as boring. The little boy, however, was a touching character. The Ju-On sequel was much frightening than this one. It had some new twists - dreams and reality blurring much more, for example - and even though it made me feel completely down, I was also happy. I have to think a little and wonder. This movie only gave cheap scares.
