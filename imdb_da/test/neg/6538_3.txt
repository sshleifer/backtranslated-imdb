I saw this at my city's independent cinema - no surprise because no mainstream theater would have its fingerprints on this train wreck. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is very distracting. The constant displacement, refocusing and zooming can cause a sensitive person to have motion sickness. It looks more like a movie student's project than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> Although well-behaved, the characters are unlikely. Josh is rude, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Without any connection to Emily and Josh's relationship, she comes out as a whiny, insecure girl who is desperate to get married. Rhett is an emotional infant who is unable to understand the complexity of human interaction. Without redeeming qualities, I don't care what happened to any of them. Of course, some people might like this movie, as the couple sitting behind me laughed hysterically. Of course, they could just have fun of it. I could hardly blame them for that.
