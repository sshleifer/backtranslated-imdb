I went to see this on Albert Finney's strength alone. He is one of my favorite actors and he rarely lives. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just stupid. It's about a little boy being born, but when his mother goes to work, he refuses to come out! This sends God and the whole man into a crisis, and Albert Finney is called out for purgatory to try to convince the boy to change and decide to be born. So Finney takes the unborn boy into a big Apple adventure hoping to show him all the reasons he should want to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot's ridicule, I could have accepted it if the director hadn't tried to make this your typical Hollywood sentimental moralistic movie. Directly, the movie was made unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem unable to resist. <br /> <br /> He further slaughtered the somewhat unconventional story by giving his hand away every moment. Whatever turns were in the store in the plot was completely given away by the way the story was ripped up. It was as if the director accepted the audience, is just a bunch of idiots who can't see the obvious tips coming from a mile away. Even Finney in his performance seemed satisfactory that it was a little awkward and out of place; and the little boy with curly locks, even though he should be cute, was actually quite boring. Bridget Fonda seemed to try to duplicate Demi Moore's performance in "Ghost" and bring tears to a moment's notice. <br /> <br /> I understand that the movie has failed so far to get distribution in the US, which surprises me as I think it has box office potential to be a modest hit, appealing to both kids and sentimental adults. As for the quality, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not that good. (4 out of 10)
