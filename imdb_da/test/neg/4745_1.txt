This movie and the first AVP movie across the Aliens and Predator franchises. <br /> <br /> They are horrible movies, badly acted, poorly written and terribly targeted. They just look like a kind of desperate attempt to make money from the good name of the original foreigners and predators, but instead of delivering a thought-out quality production, they came to the fore. <br /> <br /> Original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies were great, the redefined thriller / thriller genre by perceiving these crazy (and yet credible) creatures that took the role of "serial killer" as opposed to a human. <br /> <br /> These movies just milk the franchise and do nothing but darken its name. The Aliens vs Predator comics were brilliant and had a great story. They were true to the Alien / Predator mythology, not over the original stories, etc. Why didn't they make the comic a good movie? Because Hollywood is idiots, that's why.
