Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors selected for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the play during the first screening of a movie because I am trying to just go with the story and save the analysis to another view. In the case of "Full Ride", the play was so weak that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during the first and only show) alternating between laughter and nausea. Fortunately for most individual members of the cast, virtually everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent action. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically and find common ground in seeing too old for their credible age. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script specifically requires intense and convincing performances to portray their characters, simply exposing Smith and Monroe's dizzying lack of talent. On the positive side, they probably know that they do not look directly into the camera and they do not support. <br /> <br /> Better to have used a less attractive couple who could physically pass for the right age. The basic story is not very original, just another variation on "An Officer and a Gentleman", but it would have provided a good showcase for a talented couple of teenage actors. <br /> <br /> So again what do I know? I'm just a kid.
