Don't waste your time or money looking or even renting it. It's by far the worst feature I've ever seen. Its two hours (WAY too long) in your life will never get you back. If you're looking to be scared, you need to see something else. We went with someone who still has nightmares about Gremlins and she was not scared at least. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt to make money. Now before I start, let me say I loved the first Grudge! But the other is something of a different story. The reason is very profound and intricate. But in the end you wonder what was here or everything is all about. The action will be considered bad in a B-list pornographic film. I could find more examples, but I will not spoil it for those who are gluten-free, but I can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words .... it spreads.
