When it is just days before the film's premiere, its screenwriter ranks out of the project and requires his name to be removed from the credits known to be unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> The books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have great potential for a lively fantasy film? "Geralt de Rivia is a witch, his only purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world. But not everything that is monstrous is evil and not all is fair?" But all that didn't matter when a Polish movie crew member with low budget and no, or a little appreciation for Sapkowski's work, decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. The two-hour movie is a by-product of their actions to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to point out in this case what causes people to feel this movie as bad. Plot (incoherent, thanks to telling it with too many stories), appearing (below average except Zebrowski), dialogues (gentle), editing (chopped), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), add to the overall bad experience of the movie. Only the soundtrack, performed by Grzegorz Ciechowski, brings the beauty out of the "Wiedzmin" world, which was never brought to the screen. Even Poland's grandiose flora and fauna (where part of "The Nornia Chronicle: The Lion, the Witch and the Cloth" was shot), a key element in almost any fantasy movie, was not used up to their full potential. The more I think about this dead loss, the more I run out of words. At least it is comforting to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has only managed a movie since (also in Germany). <br /> <br /> Currently, we are back with top-notch fantasy stories and a great computer RPG (released in 2007) with reference to the Wiedzmin books. But I am sure that one day justice will be done for the Wiedzmin saga, and we will soon be treated with an equally good film adaptation.
