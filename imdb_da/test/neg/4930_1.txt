This is as stupid as it gets. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always works exactly as opposed to what a healthy person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in "Scary Movie" where Carmen Electra flies from the killer. There are two characters, one labeled "for security", the other "for safe death" (I recite from memory). <br /> <br /> And just like in Scary Movie, the characters always run in the direction of "Sure Death". <br /> <br /> Why oh, why did the girl start fire in the counter and HOLD THE DOOR SHUT ??? Would she rather die in the fire instead of being killed by the guy? Why oh, after cutting and overcoming the driver, did they sit in the seat and make him look at the wounded guy instead of shooting him or at least knocking him out? He ran over their friend and killed him a moment before, but they have scruples ?? Why oh why a hundred things more ... If this movie was a road, you couldn't drive a single yard because of the gaps. Everything is so far picked up, it begins to physically hurt in times. <br /> <br /> Add mercilessly overlay "actors" and a small budget to it, and here's what you get. When you look at the evaluation and the comments, I get the feeling that people have seen a completely different movie. The only thing that is really missing is the infamous "While She was out" toolbox - a film about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.
