I think my biggest mistake was to see this remake of '95 'Piranha' back-to-back with Joe Dante's '78 original. I did the same last week with "The Omen". Curiously, seeing the remake just after the 1976 original, I really appreciated the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons. But this approach kind of relapsed on the '95 Piranha version. It reinforced the fact that it really is a smaller image. Basically, the '95 version is more or less the exact same movie as it tells the same story and follows the virtually scene-by-scene (only Barabara Steele's character and military intervention was written off by it). But the filmmaker was not so good. The action was also worse. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing Heather Menzies' character) showed me again what a terrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (from the '78 version) had his Charlton Heston way to act, which was fun while William Katt in the 1995 version does a good job of being William Katt. So I didn't mind him. But the whole casting is largely inferior, and the only worthy event spotted James Karen ("Return of the Living Dead", Parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. John Carl Buechler's make-up effects are not as pleasant as Rob Bottins. The musical score was somewhat poor, but Pino Donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. So all these shortcomings really shone through having just re-monitored the original as part of this dual bill. When Scott P. Levy's remake follows Dante's original, I think it's entertaining enough to sit through even though it lacks white Dante's original had. But what really made me not like Levy's version much is the fact that part of the stock footage from the first movie was reused during the piranha attack scene. I never like it when filmmakers do this (and I'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons). I think that if you don't have the budget (or the imagination) to come up with fresh material, then you don't do for Pete's sake that you don't make a remake. But Roger Corman produced this (cheaper) remake so I don't think I shouldn't be all that surprised at reusing recordings. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see "Piranha", make sure it has been a while since you have seen the original. You like this remake a little more then. And oh yes, the cold little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere in this movie as one might expect. But what's worse, there's no female nudity in this one either (the original had a lot of titty shots on its way to it, and the blonde girl from the opening scene accidentally pulled her underwear a little too far when you removed her jeans!). Speak when this 95 version was made for TV.
