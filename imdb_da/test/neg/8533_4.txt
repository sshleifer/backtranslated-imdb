This movie has all the ingredients in a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can actually give me chill shock. This one did. Few horror movies give me a sense of fear. This one did. It kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The action was decent. Unfortunately, halfway through the movie, history just doesn't have many good directions it can go. It becomes clear that everything is cold if the plot is to self-destruct. It does. What builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and to the absurd. A plausible fear becomes a series of incomparable reactions from the characters. The story ends with disappointment. While this movie seems to be finished, there is a loose end that can be set up for a sequel. The movie is not good enough for a sequel. This movie is worth watching in the theater, just don't expect to be stunned. This is best suited as a movie for rent. It's probably not a movie you want to own.
