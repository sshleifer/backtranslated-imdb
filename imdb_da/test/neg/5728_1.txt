I saw this movie, or part of it, hoping it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just stupid. For one you have the worst action I ever have! The leading "actress" Birgitte Nielsen is horrible, uninspired and hardly even attractive. And she certainly doesn't look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior ass, but she does. And what about the feminist attitude is pure hypocrisy. For her family was killed by a woman, then she goes along with some war schools or something so she can learn to fight men. She joins with a fat servant and his child king, whose town was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are simply stupid and destroy the small atmosphere the movie managed to create. After that, I couldn't take more of Nielsen's painful action and the stupid clich√©s and the lack of any real actions. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that actually made it externally visible. <br /> <br /> I liked the Conan movie, but it's pure crap!
