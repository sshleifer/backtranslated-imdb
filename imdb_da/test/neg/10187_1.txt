This is the worst movie I've seen to date. 85 minutes of bad acting, (half of the casting suffers from Asperger's syndrome), horrible wigs, strange makeup (including tiny lines around the wig areas) and rather than you sign rather than dialogue that makes you puke. A comic aspect of this movie, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes that the unfortunate throw appears in the scene from stage to stage - was this movie supported by a catalog producer of desperately risky pastel underwear? Was the pan paid in clothes for their efforts? They certainly do not deserve to pay with anything else! This scary action by a movie delivers a striking plot in the first half that blends into an equally confused arch Christian bible party in the latter. The entire cast and production team must be burned at the stake or at least crucified!
