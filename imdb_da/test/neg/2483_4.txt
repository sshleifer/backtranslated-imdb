This show had a promising start as the opposite of 'Oceans 11', but has turned into a low-profile T&A. In fact, according to my little brother, it's the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best it was new and interesting things just went downhill after that. The only redeeming point in this show is JamesCaan, the other players are lacking in gloss. The characters lack depth, and they seem to be incredibly selfish and generally non-sympathetic people. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a casino" In my opinion, it was really generous, Baywatch was far better and much more realistic.
