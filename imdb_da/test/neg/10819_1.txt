Dire! Gloomy! Terrible! Ridiculous! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Really, your caught in "The Cave" with several "hard" men and a woman or two, your systematically killed by "something" and you still don't hear any cheeky grown up words !! ! A 15 CC here in England and you could tell! <br /> <br /> Egos of "Macho Men" were just too much, pass the bucket, I get sick. <br /> This film should never be exposed to daylight and, ironically, kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the earth and forgotten forever. I have a feeling that this description is not the first time to pop his head from a hole in the ground. <br /> <br /> Like the movie The Cube, it looked like a good concept, but was just let down by the last post of, well though. <br /> <br /> This comment contains Spoiler's okay, it's called The Cave. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce.
