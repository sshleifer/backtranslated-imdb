This movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny, I found this movie to be one of the most boring, slow-paced early 80s movies I've ever seen. I like most 80's cheap horror movies, but I would never rent this again. It just made no sense. A family living in the forest invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them during the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and sister-in-law do not meet well. We never expect why almost until the end of the movie, but so far everything we see is the fact that the mother has some form of ESP, and sister-in-law has nightmares and flashbacks of a disaster of what will happen to unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we have no idea what "it" looks like is all we see, a bright light that signals his approach, and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of Darth Vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various Gyser movies. So when we finally find out what and who it is, I laughed. This "killer" turns out to be a kind of foreign Japanese warrior from World War II, apparently returning to life to claim the mother and her family. And all mother does, stands in front of the living room and shakes her hands on fire or something as if she is entering a form of cramps. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
