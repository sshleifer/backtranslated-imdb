Once again, I fell to it, in my roots I demand a fun and horror screaming movie, even a vampire. Although it's stupid as long as I get my fun doing in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it doesn't take much. So I was covered by "Bled" over to Hollywood Video and was a little curious what it was about, it looked interesting so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this movie not satisfy the satisfaction I needed for my doing and meaningless violence and nudity, but I was sorry. This movie has kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because it's one of the rare times I actually hit the movie. An artist meets a vampire, I don't think I am still trying to figure out what he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I might assume he's a cockroach guy like freak people out? I think I'm not. Anyway, he thinks the artist has some flare for darkness, so he gives her a drug to go into an alternative fantasy where there is a vampire and needs blood to live? I think I'm not. So her friends are tense and decide that they will also try the drug, I think, I am not. So after they have decided to try the fabric, it becomes fun, the fantasies are real, I think I am not, and the vampire now enjoys the will, big breasted girls in scandly dressed clothes. I think I'm not. But a couple of the girls really become vampires? I think I'm not. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I'm not", it's possibly one of the worst reviews I have to write, but that's because this movie was just awful, boring and confusing. I just love to see these will be actors you can tell are looking for the "big break". Not so smart that they fell into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, in this case they should really have read the script. Because the movie, the look, the feeling, the play, everything about this movie was just bad, I really recommend you just pass the movie if you see it in your video store. This might have been an interesting movie with the concept of another dimension, but why did they choose this instructor to show their "creativity" if he has something himself? This was a bad movie, just stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
