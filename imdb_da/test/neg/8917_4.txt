Today you were the 4th Seagal movie in a mini marathon I just kept. Wow, I don't know where to start. He seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes by, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach, where they seem to improve, are embarrassing. And what does his girlfriend dream to do with something else in the plot? I can't recommend this to anyone but the most dead Seagal fan, and even then you're better off with his previous work. Of the four films in my marathon (Submerged, Into the Sun, Foreigner and Today You Die) today were the worst. A previous reviewer mentioned this, but the use of stock footage was quite obvious.
