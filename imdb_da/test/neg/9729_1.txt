Wow! I don't even know where to start with what made this movie so horrible. Perhaps I should first say that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was so laughing. Yes. The action was really so bad. The action was not even the worst part itself. The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. The signs are all roughly underdeveloped. The dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The bad guy is a caricature of an out of control, power full, sadistic. <br /> <br /> But hey actors are beautiful so guess it should do everything better.
