I first saw this movie back in the middle of the late 80's when I was a kid. We couldn't even get through it all. The dialogue, the play, everything about it was just outside the lame. <br /> <br /> Here are a few examples ... Imagine these spoke truly dramatic, way over-acted: "Oreegon? You're going to Oreegon? Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon?" <br /> < "Survivalists? No one has ever told us of any survivors!" <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, my sister and I rented it again for her 16th birthday party, just so our friends could sit and laugh at how terrible it was. I don't think we could finish it either!
