Don't make me wrong, I love bad movies ... no I love bad movies, Troll 2 .... very painful, Manos cousins ​​hands ... just see Torgo go, Guru the Mad Monk .. is that traffic noise in the middle ages? OK so it is clear, but it is one of the movies that clearly tried to be better, but didn't. Why not? It would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we have seen worse, there were not too many holes and hey I know there is not much originality in it, but then it doesn't have to kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is ok, the truck is threatening so where did it go wrong? Well, I'd like to blame it on 'Chris Moyles' look-a-like Harley ... so I want to! Comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and horror even worse, and that's the problem. I frightened this guy from the moment he stuck to his head (literally), the continued batering of the excessively humble Adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose faith that the mildest of people would not react by pushing him by the moving car dies ... and I thought it was the monsters that the director was having trouble convincing us about. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have fun poking holes in them, laughing at the manuscript, all the howlers, etc. This movie doesn't make the coveted category of 'worst movie' because it's just hurt because of being annoying nuff said. Don't go, look at something else, and you'll be a better person for that ... I promise! (Dishes for Chants of Torgo Torgo Torgo)
