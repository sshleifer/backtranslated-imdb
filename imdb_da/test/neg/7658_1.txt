In fact, there was nothing fun about this monstrosity at all !! This movie was a complete abomination. The absurdities in this movie have almost made me throw up !! I think the people responsible for this movie have taken advantage of their audience. They took a fairly decent series of movies (I said decent, not good !!) and totally sought it by trying to put money in their pockets. Production of aircraft! was a way for Hollywood to make up for this crappy flick. The worst part about it is that no one else in 1979 realized the film's asinine events (as Concorde's door pops at some wicked height or Patroni shoots a flair gun out of the window at Mach 2 to avoid a NUCLEAR WARHEAD!?!?. ... what they thought ???) was totally unrealistic, or they just didn't care! I think it is the latter of the two. The writers and the director of this "movie", if you want to call it that, really tried to suck the airport's dynasty dry with this shot!
