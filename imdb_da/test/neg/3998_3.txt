Should it be serious? I do not hope. This is one of the most pathetic hilarious movies I've ever seen. When I picked it up for a buck on the "Bad movies" shelf, it certainly lives up to its place in the store. What can I say, doing effects are spattered (proverbs) everywhere, some looking quite real, some looking like a teddy bear that has had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. The music is some of the most horrible I have heard, the play is one of the most entertaining elements ... should I continue? Don't disturb unless you've seen any other pathetic horror movies in the store and that's all there is left.
