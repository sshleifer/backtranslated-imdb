I can't laugh when I can honestly realize that this movie is not suitable for Sunday evening show on ITV4. The underground scenes are just awful when London is supposedly under 30 feet of water, Robert Carlyle's character is boring. Police commissioner outfit reminds me of something Kate Moss threw up, and Nigel Plans look a lot. Much, in fact, I'm worried that he might have had a stroke while filming. <br /> <br /> Of course, Robert Carlyle's father who was 'really all the time' has had a lot of Ketamine's neck, and though he has a big part in this awkward journey, he deserved to be beaten before being caught as he seemed to be Kate Winslett (Titanic) while dangling over the Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry movie lovers, but avoid at all costs.
