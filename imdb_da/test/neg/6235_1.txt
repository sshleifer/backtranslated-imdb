Which atomic bomb of a movie. The story goes nowhere and comes from nowhere. It leaves the theater group with those who stand up and say "is this". What happened to Redford. He was once a fair actor. Now he thinks he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a roof. Wrong. What an unemotional movie. I don't mean to be so cruel, but what a crazy movie. Amazing amateur crap. If I were in this movie, I'd be so embarrassed that I wouldn't show my face. I'm telling you, if I was connected to this movie, I'm in big trouble. This movie will go down in the annals of film making like the king of bombs that everyone else will be compared to.
