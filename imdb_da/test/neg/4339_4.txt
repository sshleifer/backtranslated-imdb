A smart overall story / location for a story. Action is respectable. The children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain was a good change but could have been better. "I love you" was more overplayed than "you complete me", but at least Van Damme got a chance to show a little soreness. One of Van Damme's better films.
