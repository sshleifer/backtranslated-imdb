Early Jackie Chan movie where there are no signs of Chan persona we know. This is Chan in a full of traditional revenge stories of the kind cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios throughout Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China. It's a very serious story that doesn't show any humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to superstars. It is also clear from looking at this if he had not reinvented himself odds, we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. As a movie on its own, this is a nice but rather unremarkable movie. I saw it in the middle of a campaign throughout the marathon's martial arts, and it would have mingled with every other movie I saw the day I hadn't noticed Jackie in the movie. Honestly, I don't think the movie is really worth the effort (there are too many other better variations), except if you are interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.
