I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten, and I promised most because of the horse scene. I should have realized that the movie was as empty as ... I can't make a good comparison. It's stupid and not even really fun. The cast members of the original who chose not to star in this probably made the best choices they had ever made to reject this; Why, oh why, did Chevy Chase come back? And how on earth did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd get involved in this swill? I bet any person who had his / her name even remotely attached to this unwanted (eg, Catering Company) is ashamed of redemption. So all in all, it is beyond terrible, terrible, and all that. Avoid it as if you wanted the Ebola virus.
