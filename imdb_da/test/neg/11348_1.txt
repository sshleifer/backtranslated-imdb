I just finished watching an episode (S1- # 5 A boy in a bush), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on this episode, this is a very bad version of CSI, the actor is crap. The main character, Dr, what she's called is so false it actually hurts. I would not throw her into a supplement for dog food! The other vulnerable thing is David Boreanaz of "Angel" fame, a good actor, doing a good job, but wasting coz of idiotic plays of that woman. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is ok, but everything is ruined because of this stupid play by Emily Deschanel. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing version of CSI, very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it. That woman is really sh # t, at least in that episode. But based on this one view, I won't even invest in seeing it even though it was shown on an elevator screen.
