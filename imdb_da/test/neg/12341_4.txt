Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford's second documentary drama, The Candidate, is a political satire that still seems fresh and relevant today. So it's a shame that 'Downhill Racer', shortly before, seems so dated in contrast. The music is ugly, and perhaps the innovative ski sequences are now standard in television coverage of the sport. Skiing seems oddly amateurish (probably accurate considering the time the movie was made, but it's hard to relate to today's professional world), and the theme of Americans in Europe also seems to be doggy at an age of ever-easier travel. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot centered on the arrogant but enigmatic heroes; Unfortunately, it's a boring redford performance that gives us some insight into his concerns or motivations. And a character-driven movie without much character is never a good game. I expected a lot, but unfortunately it is a boring movie.
