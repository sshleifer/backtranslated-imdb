I had high expectations of going into this movie, but unfortunately I feel let down. I bought it for 5 bucks at a used VHS site, and the version I purchased was the English dubbed version. The headline is horrible, so beware. "Lola" was just not as good in this movie as in "Run Lola Run", and the bad guy just got out of nowhere. And "Lola" starts catching on what's going on the other, she's coming to university. Seems unrealistic to me. I also wondered if in the original version there were American songs in the soundtrack ... they seemed extremely out of place. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it should rock.
