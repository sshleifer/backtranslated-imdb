This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. And it is in relation to Alexander, Fortress 2 and the New World. I have to go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience. In the first ten minutes, I changed the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be out of the screen. I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad movie in this day and age I was wrong. While writing this message, I've been thinking about a good reason to buy this movie. A joke present at Xmas. I blame the lady for this when she picked it, thank you darling. Be warned ....... A true shocker all around !!!!!!
