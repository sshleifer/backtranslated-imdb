It starts really interesting - the story evolves around the protagonist, who runs a "cleaning business" that specializes in clearing crime scenes. As a former policeman, he runs into a strange situation when a job suddenly "disappears officially". In addition, he discovers some relationship with a study of police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the deeper he comes into the background of history. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in an exciting story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the movie loses its touch, and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shooting involving the 14-year-old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and an unjustified justice out of character development ... why not have Cutler abandon his study for friendship's sake? or has the daughter discovered some facts? or ... many possible much better story skills are imaginable ... a really wasted ending!
