It was pretty bad - from bad acting, poor technical details, bad camera pictures and bad sound (though I saw a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly incredible neurotics, bi-polar and caricatures. Character development was horrible ... the steep little sister (why was she even written in the script?), The ugly mother (again - what purpose?) The spicy girlfriend (why did he not kill her long ago?), The dark suits 'gang (how original - could not think of a better name i think), the drug dealer's hot girlfriend (must have a hot latina if you need to have LA gangs, but it's really ...) etc etc. Can't believe , I saw it all.
