Of course, I saw the examples of this at the beginning of another Lion's Gate extravaganza, so it was of course only the best parts and so exciting. And that's a point. A young college student (Sarah) finds spawns everywhere and becomes obsessed with responding to them, and thus she is accidentally involved in any game. Now it's pretty exciting right there, but unfortunately it all gets a little confused and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) is likely to get frustrated. Signs appear with little introduction and you are not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is related to them. All this has something to do with this woman who was trying to drown a young boy many years ago, and her cause for it was that it is "all parts of the design". In fact, it's all part of "very sketchy script", and when the movie is over, you'll feel you've lost about an hour and a half, you want back to more productive uses of your time such as. cleaning the bathroom. 4 out of 10
