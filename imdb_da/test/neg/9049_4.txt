Eat Alive plays out as a bad rehearsal for the following year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally bland, the sites are criminally under-utilized, there is no attempt to create tensions or tensions. The physical effects are either frighteningly bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous rape scenes are hardly worthy of a PG-13. Even the scenarios of animal 'cruelty' are more boring than normal. The only mildly shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, goes a little Goldfinger and wears a soft soaked dildo; a scene that is just bizarre rather than graphic. My beloved wife, she from 'Romeo and Juliet Collector's Edition', saw this movie without as much as an angry disgust! And it calls itself a cannibal movie! All-in-all, a rather dull effort that thoroughly distorts the cannibal tradition. Cannibal Ferox, Luci's follow-up, is a much better example of the genre.
