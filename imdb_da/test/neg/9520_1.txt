What a self-righteous mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, but it is impossible to find any glimpse of emotional truth in this chaotic, ill-acted and violently amateur failure. In a way, you have to admire a man's balls through gloomy determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own ascent and decline - from abused, harassment to criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so selfish or so arched that it is impossible to engage with either character or plot. The raw material is potentially good stuff, but Roy does not seem able to justify the kind of narrative that should grab you in the throat, then move you to tears. And it is a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a triple image - probably because a single image would have been too boring to see. It is also interesting to see so many other good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - giving career-worst performances.
