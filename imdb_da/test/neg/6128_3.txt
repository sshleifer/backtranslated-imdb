This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol to the screen: the first was "la rupture" (1970) (from the novel "balloon man") and it's really a shame that nobody cares about it. It's Chabril's Sleeping I call some of his fans to see it. <br /> <br /> "Chocolate" cobwebs were not as strong a detective story to begin with. I read it 20 years ago and forgot about it.

In "la rupture" the first Armstrong adaptation - an average detective story that Chabrol completely transcended - you should be Audran says "they have so much money!". here chabrol has lost its bite, his strength
