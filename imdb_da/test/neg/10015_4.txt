Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Smooth parts of the Earth because a band of racial survivors - those without radioactive contaminants - in a massive mansion are surrounded by lush grounds and are waiting for the next opportunity to hunt for them with contaminated blood. The final executing is the story that one of their would be victims, Alan (William Mang, not surprisingly much like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to shut down the legally sanctioned hunters led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam (Woody Strode), who mainly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for canned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the movie, although he does not look good and only appears for about a third of the time. In terms of history, it is a mix of elements from better movies and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Dangerous Game and Escape from New York. The Final Executioner moves together at a reasonable pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminating action fans.
