Other than cop rock and it shows where the child dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, this has consistently been the worst and stupid show to survive prime time. If not for Jason Lee's unwarranted success in movies, this show would never have made it out of view if it was merged with a relatively unknown as the lead. <br /> <br /> The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron Redneck Hick uses her lottery winnings to redeem herself with the white trash of his past. Is it fun? periodically but not consistently. Is it stupid? Every single episode. <br /> <br /> I've seen many great shows, so come before their time, but this blunder has survived longer than I could ever have imagined. The dialogue is incredibly unfunny, like episode themes. Every episode for a person with an IQ over 100 is an absolute battle. And the glass on the cake? Jason Lee's annoying voice tells every episode. If it wasn't for the state's southern culture and rednecks in the south, this show wouldn't have an audience. <br /> <br /> If you are a moron and need a show quite defective, yet crowded with bad taste, poor dialogue and dimwit characters fail in life ... well then you're probably an actor on this show .
