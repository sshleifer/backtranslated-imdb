Looking for something shocking? Okay fine ... the picture is. It's about it. This movie tries to make deep connections with the audience through various symbols and end up being annoying. I'm not sure if the director's purpose was to really portray a kind of deep message to his audience, or if he was just trying to shock hell out of them with gore, sex and violence. I was thinking that it was probably the first ... but in the failed attempt ... it just became a piece of artificial waste with lots of blood, some unpleasant signs and an imminent dependence on religious symbolism. If you're looking for an independent film for criticism for its attempt to use metaphor ... you have it. If you are looking for a gore flick that will make you sour and uncomfortable ... here you go ... If you are looking for a movie that will annoy you to no end because you realize that in the end was the message stupid ... the movie was stupid ... and you will never get those minutes of your life back .. It's probably the movie for you!
