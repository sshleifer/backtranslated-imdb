I have read all of Shakespeare's plays, watched productions by a majority of them and even acted and directed some. I don't necessarily think Shakespeare should be done in the "traditional" way, but I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> There is nudity that is free and unnecessary. There is a big queue that is far beyond what I think Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and there are the elements that sing and dance that make no sense to the movie, but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-submission. I'm sorry to say it I wasted quite good money buying the DVD of this movie.
