Sound: <br /> <br /> I have never seen a movie with worse sound. There are scenes where people go through the grass and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps. They must measure their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how in some movies they forget a line so they have to copy it on a shot at the back of a person's head. Here the editors were not so clever. There is actually a scene where Shannon Tweed's characters say her line without moving her lips at all! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure their background sound they played has effects on loops while they shoot, because in many scenes the sound effects will either be different or absent when the camera changes angles. <br /> <br /> I could write much more about how bad the sound is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this movie they probably consider opening points to be special effects because they seemed so challenging to produce. The main title and the first few names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky, and they wobble as if they were carefully hand painted on each frame. <br /> <br /> Reusing extras in this movie is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, and in one stroke, 30 or more of them will be killed. If only the film was high enough to distinguish between those who died again and again. It is also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 meters away. There is a scene a scene when some of the rebels run out of their cabins in the rebellious base, and a hut shakes when the rebellion leaves the door. It makes you doubt whether the cottage will last long enough to meet the inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks like threatening as a few races, but somehow comes equipped with an infinite range of missiles. When they show that the missiles are being shot out of the helicopter's missile bends, they often shoot in unpredictable directions that are very similar to large bottle rockets. They still manage to hit their targets with ease, which as mentioned above is always a very safe distance away from the rebels they kill. Note the reused recording of the pilot pressing the LIVE button to cancel the missiles (because it is printed vertically, the first time we saw it, we read it as the "EVIL" button). <br /> <br /> Notice how the branched launcher they use produces identical explosions to those created by helicopter missiles. It is also fun in many scenes how the actor in the foreground shoots in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers that he kills. And often shoots shoot a disproportionate number of shots to the soldiers being killed (like when a short-fire fire kills a large group of enemies). Yes, this movie is very very bad. The reason was thought almost as well as a 5-year football game, and editing is the worst I have ever seen. But honestly, sometimes it is fun to spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who genuinely participated in such a horrible movie.
