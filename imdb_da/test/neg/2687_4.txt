I'm new to Argento's work, and if this and Suspiria are any indication, then Argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than history. In his films, characters are placed in dizzying and fascinating horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera flows fairly through sets while the characters run, stumble and tighten to any terrible conclusion. It worked really well in Suspiria. For some reason it didn't work here. <br /> <br /> The problem I see with this movie is that although the protagonist "gets help" by contacting the police and asking for help from his friends, she still feels as if she refuses to "get help" in the form of trying to find a solution to her problem. The capture in this movie is that she's caught in the killer's little game, one that she could easily get out of ... not to sit up so easily? Strangely, the sign seems to have the torture that the killer gives her, which in a sense is and could have worked, except that the whole psychology is thrown mostly because of what Argento feels like to do. <Br /> <br /> As a loving greeting to "Opera's Phantom" it is definitely an interesting and unique tag. For all its worth, Argento also leaks into operational movements, which well emphasizes the action. It just doesn't make much sense, especially as it goes on to a completely useless ending (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris's novel "Red Dragon". No, it didn't work). Why the character must go from a horrible experience of capturing to a willing with the director is beyond me. It almost felt self-service on Argento's side. All in all, a fun experience, and between this and Suspiria I am more than willing to follow up on several Argento productions. But this is not a movie, I would like to return to or remember. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
