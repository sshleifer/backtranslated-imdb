If you really loved GWTW, you will find the story quite disappointing. Those who might think of this are just about a romantic story and south, will probably be happy with this decent TV production (depending on I consider an important miscast choice for Scarlett). But let me say that considering the novel, nothing good could come of this. <br /> <br /> I've read GWTW more than 20 times and I really appreciate the adaptation made by Mitchell for the movie. It took me time to understand how good the finish was: Scarlett knew she was going to restore Rhett as she always wanted what she wanted. But there was no kiss at the end. Then Alexandra Ripley came to "fix" this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty Scarlett could be, and of course describing in detail how exactly she gets back to Rhett even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been farther from Mrs Mitchell's mind, I'm sure). The story between these points is, in my opinion, just a long and tedious ride made to tie ends, show costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and utterly unnecessary ending. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell could live again, she would die once again when she would find out what Scarlett was after GWTW. Of course, it is not reasonable to compare this with the original, but it is not GWTW error. Is it not? Is it good if I don't compare it to the original? Maybe. Sorry to say I really don't care. I would expect a little more compromise to continue the (suberb) work of others, otherwise don't even try.
