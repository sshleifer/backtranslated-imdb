I reckon this to be an "alternative reality" teen flick ... More precisely a Ferris Bueller type character who heads a cheat ring. Yes, I know it's not supposed to compare to Ferris Bueller, at least not in an "oranges-to-oranges" way, but it won't be less. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: It's galaxies away from being even a smaller classic. It can be seen, but only if you don't expect much. That said, the protagonist has some charm, but the premise is thin because the writing is just not clever. The movie just didn't deliver enough laughs, twists or tensions to keep my interest. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I continued to look ... Looking with hope to see if there is a sudden click. It didn't. So, stylish as it is, I would not recommend this movie. BTW, it seems odd to see Mary Tyler Moore as principal. She is really dissatisfied, I hope the paycheck was huge.
