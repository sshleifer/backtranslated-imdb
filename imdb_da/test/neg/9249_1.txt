The action is awkward and scary, and not in a good way ... at all. The writing, dialogue and chemistry between the actors is horrible. Nothing makes sense, and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a Mexican soap opera (telenovela). Everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all the actors involved make it much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this ??? Using the word cheesy to describe this Canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century. Did the director even see the final cut before it was put on the air ???
