This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie and one of his absolutely worst James Glickenhaus destroyed it! All the characters are decent I guess, but the story is like that, but Jackie Chan is still great in this, even though he's so bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had zero chemistry together and it was very boring many times, but the final was above average and managed to be quite entertaining and had some good stunts! I haven't seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I'm sure it's better than this dud, plus the twist is very predictable! It's really lifeless and bland, and I don't blame Jackie for not seeing this, and if he didn't steal it, it would have been unbearable and totally unpacked. The opening should be memorable, but nothing I haven't seen before and done better, and I thought the whole movie was pretty lazy and could have been a great movie if Jackie was in control of it! Plus I didn't really mess up any of the characters. This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie, and one of his absolutely worst James Glickenhaus ruined it! Not recommended even for Die hard Jackie Chan fans. The direction is horrible! James Glickenhaus does a terrible job here with extremely cold camera work, bad angles and keeps the movie boring for the most part. That act is like that. Jackie Chan is FANTASTIC as always, but he is not his usual energetic self and looks bored and knocked out in the whole movie, had no chemistry with Danny Aiello, nor do I blame him! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is here OK as Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass and he had no chemistry with Jackie, he did OK, I guess. Roy Chiao is decent as the biggest villain, but just went through the moves and was not all that threatening he is still cold. The rest of the throw is at best average. Overall not worth your time or money. * 1/2 out of 5
