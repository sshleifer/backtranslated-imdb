If you find the hopelessly amateur acting, the uninteresting story, the fake blood and all the mindless fragments tolerable, then you can actually have a pretty good time watching this blurry, low-lying movie. You might also want to check out a pretty good disaster sequence offered, even though it's not good enough to make the rest of the movie worthwhile. (**)
