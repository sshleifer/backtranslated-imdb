This is just one of the movies that keeps you moaning and that I wanted it to be over. The problems are many and the good points are few. I feel the biggest problem with this movie is that it has what is similar to a cheesy plot, and they are trying to make it an epic movie, as a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones signing is not epic, It's cheese. When you have cheese, you make the movie more fun. Granted, the final scene with the monkeys and the laser was very nice to see and there was a need for more things of that kind. Instead, the actors do such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot in the midst of all the serious excitement the movie is trying to create. The reason is about a woman trying to figure out what happened to her missing past husband while also searching for some kind of legendary diamonds. She uses these two guys who trained a monkey to make sign language and now want to return her to the wild as a cover to enter the country and begin the mediocre adventure of life. The only thing that makes this movie somewhat tolerable is Ernie Hudson's character and laser attack at the end.
