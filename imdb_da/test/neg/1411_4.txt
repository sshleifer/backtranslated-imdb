I found this Robin Williams vehicle mildly entertaining at best. I think you would call it a political satire of sorts. It's about a political talk show host / comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins. I found most of the humor to dry myself, and Robin Williams is much more restrained and calming than usual. I would say that the film is more of a drama than a comedy with a little mystery and excitement. I think the dramatic parts worked better than comedy parts and the mystery and excitement (although it is a small part of the movie) worked best. I would not rate this movie very highly. For me, this was an OK waste of 2 hours, but nothing special. The best advice would be to catch it on TV / cable or rent it cheaply first before making a decision on whether to buy. my vote for this year's man is a 4/10
