Norman Wisdom's last star vehicle was a departure from his previous excursions ?? bring his accident-accessible milquetoast up-to-date, this is a product of Swinging Sixties! The end result is a troubled and occasionally embarrassing comedy that blends the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with a leader on a trip to a bank conference that falls to teenager Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind getting involved in him, but doesn't take their relationship seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geesons friend who warns Norman of her unstable character. <br /> <br /> The film is not as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating would have and, if anything, is interesting for its treatment of midlife crisis (which in many ways resembles Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979], both of which I have only looked at); Towards the end, Norman is even trying to bring his wife around to his new way of thinking! The beautiful things seem like they themselves perform a number of good tunes in a nightclub, and Norm himself sings the exciting title track!
