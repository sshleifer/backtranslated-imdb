I have never voted 1 for a movie on IMDB, but for this I am sorry that the scale does not go down to -10. All I can say is this movie, I saw it in a Sneak Preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. I don't mind the stupid jokes. I can live with that stupid story. But when I see the stupid grinning "protagonists" with their pseudo-foreign speech (only the Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt I was fraudulent, I never thought I could. (If they had left them, it might actually be acceptable ...). There is not much more to say about this. You can laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous, but it doesn't make it any better. It is certainly not fun. <br /> <br /> If you live outside of Germany, be happy and glad that this horrible work will most likely never make it to your cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
