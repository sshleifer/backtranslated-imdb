Who gave these people money to make a movie? There was nothing fun about it. The fact that the fad dog was the funniest thing about this disease says it all. First of all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it just took the name and counted on all the people who liked the Chevy Chase original. They took Randy 'I have no talent, I'm just a fat and sweaty pig' Quaid (the only wrong thing about part 1) and made a movie about him ... There are only morons in his family but not they ' they are not sweet 'kinda moronic, but they' touch me 'kinda moronic. Seeing this pile of dirt helps you hope everyone who participates in it DIES! They don't even bother to get the effect in order ... when they are on the boat, the only thing that moves is the false background ... when green Quaid is in the water, you can tell by the lighting that it is in a study. This movie was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and should never have been made ... it would have been so much more to throw the money into a volcano. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope I reached some of you ... No one warned me and now I'm scared of life Merry F * cking Christmas
