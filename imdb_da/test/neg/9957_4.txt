"Dr. Cameron, a discredited scientist succeeding with his attempt to create serum, transforms the men into wolf-like creatures. Originally, this formula developed to help the world, the scientist decides to use his newly created subject for exact revenge on the scientists responsible for Scientist's daughter Lenora becomes cautious about her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter. . Food scientist George Zucco (like Lorenzo Cameron) creates his formula quite imaginatively by mixing human and wolf blood. This brings the animal into the holking Glenn Strange (like Petro aka Pedro), who is instructed to act as Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men". Johnny Downs (like Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (like Lenora Cameron) are a sympathetic werewolf hunter and ladies in need. Certainly, "The Mad Monster" is not a substitute for "The Wolf Man"; but it is a useful addition. The grainy black-and-white photography enhances the foggy, cow-webbed atmosphere. "God" (uncredited) also makes a successful conclusion. As Blaine (Robert Strange) said, "Mingling the blood of man and animal is actually sacred!" <br /> <br /> **** The Mad Monster (1942) Sam Newfield ~ George Zucco, Johnny Downs, Anna Nagel
