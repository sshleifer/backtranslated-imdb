After I couldn't ignore the hype about the show, I started to see season one and it hit me really well and I was hooked .... for about 5 episodes, it started to spiral down. Why? First, Ethan Suplee is written to act as a complete idiot, confirming it of course by spearing semi-random things in great expectation that somehow it will be the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly has great looks, but if she seems to stretch her lips to explore parts of the face that they usually never go to and make strange grimaces to highlight everything she says is fun, she is far away. Perhaps she thought her character would be too flat, faded and she would make it colorful and spicy, but made a flood of colors, overcooked spices and screams of attention, and it hurt my eyes, ears and intellect. <Br /> I really wanted to love this show as I said, the premise is great (coming from the same shelf as Amelie Poulain's Fabulous Destiny) and Jason Lee does a good job here with some of the other actors, but there is no way no, how i would get 'sucked in' and forget that this is just a show, because Presslight and Suplees surreal, extreme characters suddenly wake me up when they come up. It is worth noting that their characters and plays would be fine if it wasn't a 70-part series and if they didn't get that much screen time.
