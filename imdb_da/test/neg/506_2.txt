This is the movie that basically sounded the bell for the Hollywood autograph. Over $ 40 million, the Sky Gate is so poorly conceived and executed that it would take a lifetime to break down all areas of failure. What really makes me the most is that it is technically very bad, an unforgiving sin for the money that went into it. John Hurt's initial speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people seem to think that Cimino had it as a "style". He didn't. It's just bad sound recording. The characters are not very delicate, except for the four or five leaders; In the climatic battle scene, it is difficult to tell who the bad are and who are the good guys. Even at this level, it is impossible to enjoy the movie. Casting by Isabelle Huppert as the town Wife is a joke, her French accent makes the whole character a scam. The action is generally stiff, with no scope or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt's character is the only one with swords or vitality (although Hurt in his 40s plays a fresh facet Harvard degree with bags under his eyes is patented ridiculously). <br /> <br /> I'm guessing it's lengthy, overkill. The roller-skating sequence could have been easily cut, the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie clich√©, and the final scene on the ocean liner is straight into the Twilight Zone. Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just would have been the perfect final. In fact, these scenes in themselves are not bad, but Cimino has not earned the right to include them because what he has given us as "meat" of the picture is so incompetent poor. The editing is poor, especially in the big battle campaign. At one point, the same explosion is used with the same wagon wheel flying from the explosion, three different times. I wish I could say something - something - good about this movie: a fantastic scene, a good performance, even a memorable dialogue, but I can't. It's just a big scary mess. About the only thing I liked was the cinematography and the Montana sites which are amazing. Even Cimino couldn't screw it up. This is a long, boring, poor movie of all standards. And the people who say it is bashed alone because of the cost overruns just talk to themselves. 1/2 * out of 4
