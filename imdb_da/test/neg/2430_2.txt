Only when does this story take place? It must take place after the first film, because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha have their third child, but it cannot take place after the other movie because Kronk does not get a boyfriend or wife or something? You never see her in the show. <br /> <br /> Also, why does Kuzco go to school? The whole plot of the show is that Kuzco goes to school so he can be emperor. But wasn't he an emperor before this? And who is the emperor while learning to be emperor? Shouldn't it be Yzma? Or was the Yzma lighthouse already in this timeline? And if the true why is waiting for him to fail to become Empress? Plus, you know in the first movie that he was educated from birth to being emperor of private counselors. So he should well know what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Why is Kronk a student? He is about 25 who stated it in the first movie. He is an adult who goes to high school. Does anyone think he's a moron? I like Kronk, but I think because of his age, and because everyone knows he works for Yzma, he should have been a teacher. Being Home EC teacher would be right up his alley. <br /> <br /> Malina is very unlikely. She supposes to be Kuzco's love interest / moral compass. But much time she comes out of bossy and knows it all. She often says that I like "I should be proud because I am beautiful and smart". <br /> <br /> She has ESP when it comes to Kuzco and knows when he is in trouble when he cheats or even when he sings Hot Hot Hottie song in the head, even if she mocks the leader, school newspaper and holder just A + in all its classes. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in using her prettiness to make Kuzco do the right thing and do it well in school and dance him. In fact, she seems more moral to Kuzco saw a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. When I bought before Yzma tries to get Kuzco to fail, she becomes Empress. Not sure how it is supposed to work to be fired and everything. Yzma seems to relive the first movie in each episode. In almost every show she looks at, she turns Kuzco into an animal hoping to make him fail a class. (There are only 3 times I can think of what did not happen.) The jokes that Yzma is old are not as smart in the show as they were the movie. And classic jokes about Yzma are being used for death in the show (like "Drag the Level, Krunk!", Rollercoaster and Lab). <br /> <br /> Also some other points that do not make sense in this series. The fact that when Kuzco is awarded something, everyone seems like this task, causes him to pass or fail the class, but he seems to pass every task given to him. So why does a task mean so much? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who controls the kingdom while this is happening? Do they have a consul or a steward? You never see anyone controlling the kingdom unless Kuzco has washed his forces back, or Yzma is Empress. Why does Kuzco go to a normal farm school? Should he not learn to lead a country, what should be done in the event of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I could see taking some normal classes as agriculture (so he wanted to know how to prepare the country for a famine or something) but tie-in? How is it useful? <br /> <br /> Now I know someone will say "But it doesn't have to be sensible, it's probably fun." Then they should have more fun things in there. All the fun things about the show are already in the movie. Also, if they notice some of these great plot holes, why not they joke about fun on them as in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk come to the secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can't explain how they got their first.) There are some good points, it's nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in series like Bucky and monkey with the bay. Pacha and his family are still very good signs with good soil quality. I feel this series would be entertaining for younger children. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that the series is not as good as the movie on which it is based, but it can be good for younger children.
