This HBO original is pretty straightforward and pretty stupid. Armand Assante, once again making a bad Stallone imitation, Ray Wellman is an ex-con right on parole. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy has stuck with Stalwart Elliot, played by Sam Neill. Further complicated issues are that Ray's old Cell friends want some favors and they kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot are held up despite mutual dislike. What follows is tremendous and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win the Oscar in the future, she is not so polished here, but her raw feelings, sincerity, and some pretty nude scenes make it almost worth seeing. Almost. <br /> <br /> Rent "Fever" (no title does not fit the movie) if you are a fan of her, otherwise you can skip it and be grateful, it's the stars that went on to better things. <br /> <br /> Note! This is a tough "R" flick for language, violence and nudity.
