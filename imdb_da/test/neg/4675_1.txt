As a Scot, I find the idea of ​​"Macbeth" moved in Time and Space to America completely moronic. I am sure this does not apply to widespread IMDb users, but why are so many Americans unable to relate to any movie concept that is not set in their country? This attitude does not favor Americans in the Big Wide World here. <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that "The Wicker Man" was recreated and set in the United States, completely rejected by its cultural context and by a Polticaly Proper sex change for a leading character. <br /> <br /> Wondering what Robert, Bruce as New York policeman, Mary, Queen of Scots, as a "Soccer Mom" ​​juggling, kids, career and relationship? <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, open up all the other cultures on the planet!
