From Kreestos: <br /> <br /> The dialogue is horrible, horrible, drifting. Acting poor. Many plot errors. I do not recommend it at all. <br/> <br /> From Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic Licenses The script's manuscript is attributed to two copiers [1], both of whom were men, not female as depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> The copiers also did not contribute to or alter the score. In fact, they were recounted by Beethoven for any deviation that arose from the original score. <br /> <br /> The film was set in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's ninth symphony. Throughout the film, Beethoven shows that it is difficult to hear, but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In fact, Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; His condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The ninth symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's hearing was seriously aggravated. At this point in his life, most of Beethoven's conversations were relieved by the use of notebooks. However, it can be argued that he could also read people's lips, as evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Beethoven gives an allusion to the moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism when Sonata # 14 "quasi una fantasia" is not called "Moonlight" until several years after his death.
