I watched this movie on Telly the second night and little did I know what a cringe party it would be ... I knew it would be stupid but not so bad! This film exemplifies everything that is terrible in the Australian comedy. Except for the most boring, uninspired scenarios and characters I've ever encountered (except for the dubious French-produced American tax-breaking comedies!), Most situations were dull, incredible, stereotyped, and so not fun just ... awful! <br /> <br /> One such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene. From a screen printing perspective, the authors used the most uninteresting - not to mention the incredible - scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage ... They are on vacation in their lives and they will risk it all (including a $ 300 deposit, luggage and room) to exercise their right to dance on a bus? I mean, they are about half an hour away from their destination! At least, they could have made the bus driver kick them, but they don't willingly leave because they can't take it anymore! "And destroying their vacation ... Nevertheless, I can't believe the authors haven't worked out this scary scenario. I think a 10-year-old could come up with 5 setups more clever, fun and credible. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many others - the truly imaginative stereotypical psychopath, the whole relationship with the angry angry boyfriend and gathering virgin, "Wow Man! Derude goth girl" breathing things on the train - Everything was just sad ! I can't think of a redeeming feature of this movie, except that maybe the third wheeler was sweet. Spoiled his career by showing up in this trash can though!
