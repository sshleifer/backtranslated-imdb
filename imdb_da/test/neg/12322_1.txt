Now the scientists were so funny, and I usually do not go to movies on the opening night, especially with my children, because ...... you never know. Here's a movie that doesn't appeal to kids or adults as the jokes are too perverse for kids and fall flat for adult entertainment. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year olds and had to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially what happens here is a total twist of Dr. Seuss classic. It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for his money. If it was a subplot, it might have been fine, but it ends up being the big plot around the whole movie, and the "cat" plays a part plot role by exhibiting the neighbor to the mother of who he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass the movie.
