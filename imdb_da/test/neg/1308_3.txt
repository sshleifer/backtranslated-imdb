I usually do not write reviews, but for this movie I had to. I'm shocked by the acting talent in this step that wastes ... the script was terrible ... editing terrible ... and the plot very thin. You use the first half of the movie and wonder who is talking to whom and what in the world they are doing. The last half of the film is lowered slightly but has no depth or feeling. The only saving grace is the neat but still limited CGI and the location is London. I gave 3 stars to it and the fact that the actors were still trying to do a good job on the drive they were given. If you want to lose a few hours in your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment, it's still the movie for you. But I would recommend doing something else with your time instead of watching the right archive movie online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
