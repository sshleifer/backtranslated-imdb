Following the general film that romanticized the Dublin gangster's life, the general to such heroic proportions that made the average Dublin person ill, Kevin and his attempt to portray Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, aka the General, the actor is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native Dub, and a tragedy for Kevin Spacey fan. In short, the movie is worth seeing .... No, unless you like bad acting with hilarious 'real Irish accents, then you're sure to be safe'. The story is ripped off by the commercially successful 'The General', which, despite the glory of a well-known Dublin animal in Martin Cahill, is still worth a visit because it shows real working class Dublin and internationally because of its true Irish actor and killer cast, including John Voight. All in all, 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' is anything but a decent movie. Avoid.
