Clossius says that "Baltic Storm" is prohibited in Sweden. That is not correct! Instead, you can buy the movie almost anywhere, as in gas stations, shopping malls, internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price because this movie is so bad and no one wants to see it, despite all the tricks that stop the interest. The film only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psychoses, and other people who live in la-la-land and those who "know the truth". <br /> <br /> Working at a museum with Estonia's disaster as a theme I have met them all! I have heard of any theory that exists such as cocaine smuggling, weapons smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, foreigners, Russian-American-Estonian-Swedish and Finnish intelligence, often in different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some normal people have asked why we are not showing the movie? A question asked only by those who have not seen this horrible nonsense film. <br /> <br /> Once again, "Baltic Storm" is not prohibited in Sweden. It has some entertaining qualities, but what the hell does Donald Sutherland in this movie?
