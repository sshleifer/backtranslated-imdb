Started to see this, but didn't believe in any of the characters. Especially the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice, but the rest was just very slow. It was a very shallow movie, and it made me feel like I was playing in a movie instead of a movie. The characters were very 'stagey' and the story was much like a scene farce. When the pyromania broke, the assistant got bored and didn't care what happened next so I turned off. Glad I didn't pay to see it. Don't laugh or even smile once. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as "comedy" when they are funny peculiar rather than funny haha. I've finally learned to avoid which Americans denote dark comedies that usually turn out to be cruel strange and unfunny. Now, it seems that I have to be a little more discerning when they call a movie romantic comedy too. Maybe comedy means something else when used on a movie instead of a series in America. I don't understand why America can produce incredibly funny comedies like two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but can't seem to produce really funny movies without resorting to toilet humor. This movie was not rough or anything. But it was nothing at all, just a big gabbe ...
