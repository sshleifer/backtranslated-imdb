I just don't get these reviews! I don't think they are written by the kind of LOG fan who would worship something they ever do without questioning whether it is actually good. <br /> <br /> I'm a massive fan of the program, but thought this movie was a pointless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I had come out of the cinema because I was more than twice grin. At one point, I thought it might just be me before I realized that there was almost no laughing thing from the rest of the audience. I didn't expect much of a plot (very few TV comedies stand out for 90 minutes) but thought that the odd bit of classic LOG dialogue or visual joke (which at the beginning of each program) would carry movie. After 5 minutes of the 17th century plot, I prayed that it would end (little did I know it would continue for the rest of the movie). It was just not fun. <br /> <br /> I was just massively disappointed and can't see the story too kind to it, though a few deadly fans write enthusiastic reviews.
