Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with horrible action superficial and overwhelming trawling all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and middle life. The main actor grimaces nervously through the film, struggles to portray the appropriate level of complacency, self-confidence self-pity, the worthless character and the manuscript required. I'm sure the book was bad, but it may not have been so bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a vomited "Tuscan" lens filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun was not Tuscan enough?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene changes to Rome and (so imaginative!) The Amalfi Coast. You've never seen the white marble in Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument, which looks so yellow ... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore totally worth seeing.
