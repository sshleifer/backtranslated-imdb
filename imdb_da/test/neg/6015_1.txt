What's the point? Hasn't it been done before, better? And again? Why is Werner Herzog wasting her good talents and time with junk? Shouldn't he shoot a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> It all felt false from the beginning. Werner Herzog would never have tried to make a film about the Loch Ness myth - at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers - so the plot was not credible from the start. The actors who should act as they do not act, of course, were acting. The story was not interesting, the "everyday people" needed in each mocker were invisible, the personalities were outdated, the jokes were not fun, the effects were convincing, and the end was nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> I just don't see the point. It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah. Maybe if those who believed in such a movie were trying to make someone who blamed people who were really out to find a real Nessie, now it could have had some potential. But Herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be. A mockumentary about the cryptozoological crowd would have had so much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a miss.
