There are many other comments on how poor this film is. What I wanted to point out is how this film took the greatest science project in history and made it small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Almost all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was a choice between two alternative ways to do things, they both did. The first persistent nuclear reactor was fired under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate student cutting axes as scram mechanism. It is a fascinating story that involves hundreds of sites and thousands of people, as this movie seems to reduce to a small group of eccentric in New Mexico. The other thing I really didn't like was the great moral debate about whether we should continue the project after Germany has given up. Okay, we have thousands of (mostly) men who worked for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they don't want to see it work? There was a lot of controversy at the time of whether we should use the device, but it was not so serious, clearly not the big debate that this movie makes it to be.
