The film disappointed me for many reasons: First of all, the idea of ​​a future, which initially seemed realistic to me, was well-built, but only had a marginal role. Then the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. Middle Eastern environment, man with family meets new girl abroad, karaoke bar, camera movements and imaging - all it was a very poor imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation, which also had credibility. This film tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins was thinking about making this movie! The female actress is horrible - did she play precog in the Minority Report? And why should you show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in translation did not need to show exaggerated love scenes. R-rated just for this? This movie is not even worth watching from a videotape!
