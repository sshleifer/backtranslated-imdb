Please do not look here. I had several laughs throughout this movie, but they were due to all unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was great how bad the character development was. Pacino again played Pacino and worsened most of the time. The scenes in this movie look as if they were collected from 20 other bad movies by a really bad editor. There is no continuity and I wondered why I did not leave 15 minutes in this. <br /> <br /> I suggest you never see a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This was really terrible.
