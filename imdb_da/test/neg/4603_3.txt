I've been waiting a long time to watch this movie. IFC finally ran one night. I thought it would be something like "Barfly" from Barbet Schroeder. Wrong. This movie does not re-create the underworld of chintzy, dirty, smoky, character-filled bars you associate with his stories. It also fails to capture the Bukowski attitude that Mickey Rourke did so well in the above mentioned film. The natural smart-ass attitude. Fans of Charles Bukowski will enjoy watching scenes from his books on the screen, but those who are not familiar with his books could get the wrong impression of his works. This movie just looks like another movie of the week about a drunk and his relationships. If you want a better idea of ​​Charles Bukowski's world view "Barfly".
