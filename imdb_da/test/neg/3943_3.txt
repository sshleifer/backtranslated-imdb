A mediocre, at best horror flick, dealing with stupid, not as horrific teenagers who discover a bad video game (GASP) kills those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is Mystery Gang's persistent mystery in "Scooby Doo". I waited for them to pull a mask out of one of the bad guys. I could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci-fi, but go all the way to theaters, people came up. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something of the crummy two-man director Uwe Boll, as this would be his cast. As always, the amazing thing about video game systems is the glorious power button. I would suggest using the mid-view. * 1/2
