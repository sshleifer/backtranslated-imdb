This was a very good show. I enjoyed the real-time and flashback construction when the old Diggers meet again and recall the fears of their captives in Changi POW Camp. The biggest problem with the way the show was written is that the scene of life in Changi is more like a holiday camp than what the place should have been like. I'm old enough to remember movie footage of the men liberated from Changi and other Japanese POW camps. No actor could lose enough weight to resemble the condition of these men. They made the Jews in Belsen look like sumo wrestlers. I've met several veterans from Changi over the years. Many would never ride in a Japanese car, let alone own one. The physical and mental torture that the men performed was too horrific for them to speak for themselves. What percentage survived? John Doyle can be okay to write comedy to "Roy and HG" (I also hate it), but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated. I'm happy for satirists to write "Brian's life" and make fun of the crucifixion because of course it's comedy, though some consider it to be in bad taste. "Changi" is written as a portrayal of a real event and can therefore be regarded as younger people as a true record. Great performance with a fine molding cannot redeem this lightweight manuscript.
