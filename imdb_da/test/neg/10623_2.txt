When I borrowed this movie, I didn't expect a high quality, but it was just sad. Most of the play was so incredibly bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. There is nothing like seeing a child announce things like "Oh no! My father is invisible!" or "I wonder what this does?" In the same monotone you can announce traffic advice over the radio. There are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, though it would be pretty easy to guess as there aren't too many real plot changes. Lots of holes too. For example, the father is invisible, and the inventor discovers which part is needed to make him visible again. Then the boy goes and steals it from an electronics store. Couldn't he just ask his father for the cash? <br /> <br /> This is evident in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was pretty stupid as the invisible father takes off his clothes while it is invisible and as soon as appears naked during a meeting, or walks around with the head covered all the time. Fun at first, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5 because it can be seen, and it is one of the movies that is fun in their own way ... like the monotonous recitation of lines.
