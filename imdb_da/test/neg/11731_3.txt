The first review I saw on IMDB says Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Make me wonder if he saw the original. It is difficult to review Psycho if you do not have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very sympathetic and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is scary but does you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence, and you have a blue print for some of the 80's and 90's slasher movies. Where does the movie go wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is fine as a Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is completely wrong. For one thing he looks too young. Second, he has no idea how to play the role. His nervous grin reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy at Happy Days. Everything he does screams I did! The original film, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you uncomfortable with the mother's influence on Norman and makes her a truly distinct character. What about the shower scene. When I finally watched the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was amazed at its power to scare the heel out of me. Bernard Herrman's score gets incredibly sharp and high and goes on to scare you than Danny Elfman's synth interpretations under the stage. This shower scene only serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and some fine color blood. Which brings us to the choice of color film. Not working. <br /> <br /> There's something about remaking classic movies that almost never seems to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this movie, he should have left it alone
