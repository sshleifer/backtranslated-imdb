I just wanted to say I was very disappointed after watching this movie! I expected a Bible story visualized with great special eg etc. But during the film I found out that this was an absolute disaster ... it was not biblical at all. Only the boat and the animals looked like the story ... if you want a visual translation of the Bible version of Noah then don't watch this movie!
