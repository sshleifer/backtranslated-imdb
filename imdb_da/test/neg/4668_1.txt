Primarily. I'm not looking down on the Americans. I know many people who are intelligent people from the United States. But this movie is so completely bad that I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Lots of scenes are so incredibly fake. Eg. Departure of the 2 room ships. You see them getting rid of all the thought in the room. Only a small distance apart. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past? Just a tinsy winsy part that came out. Here it is just common to release fuel tanks that are so large if they are no larger than the whole ship. Which idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do it at the same time ??? Second, the Russian station is a piece (s) of crap. I hate to bring this up to you, but the astronauts today go to Russia. Since their equipment is much more reliable than NASA's. The shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it just to pay the bills. And there is no better alternative to it. And the list of vertebrae goes on and on again. This is really an insult to people who take space travel seriously. And I know half as much as these guys do. But the most annoying part (read: the whole movie) is the propaganda and the patriot's crap that you get choked with. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was looking at a CNN business commercial for an hour. The actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face, starting matches, ignoring the police, etc. But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone is queuing up to commit suicide for it (bomb detonator) ?? Perhaps I lack the feeling of being a true "Patriot" who can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. While driving with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, drive in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me to handle as well. And when I finally got hold of and pulled the flagpole and the fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realized I was happy that this movie was finally finished. I do not know why so many good actors participated in this clever, stereotypical, propaganda movie. But I take care of them. This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as "Uncle Sam" thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been destroyed, no one cares.
