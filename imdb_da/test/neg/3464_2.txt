Check out the two octogens that review Leatherheads. These guys are old-school Hollywood and a hit on YouTube. They always provide an insight and fun review. They have movie comparisons that are really interesting and they have a junk back and forth that is endlessly entertaining. They know movies, collectively they have been in biz for almost a century. Lorenzo is a well-known screenwriter and Marcia is a famous producer. All their insight into movies always gives you something to think about. See what they think of Clooney lately ... <br /> <br /> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-W7evBEArs
