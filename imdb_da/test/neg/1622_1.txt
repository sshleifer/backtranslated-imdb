There is simply no redeeming quality about this movie. Okay, some of the costumes are okay, but they're not something you can't see in the Conan flicks. And what happens to Ator's hair? I can't believe this is part of a series! I would say one thing about this movie: It was considered bad enough for a fair lampooning by the early version of MST3K, and I suggest to anyone curious enough to see how bad this movie is to see the version of the movie for moral support, if nothing else.
