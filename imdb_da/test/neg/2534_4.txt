This movie starts promising enough, but it gets a bit rounded and caught in its stylistic charm. Set design, costumes and music were wonderful - as close to perfect as you can get. But the more I got into the movie, the more I felt that all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not the audience. Although I loved watching it, except for some short musical scenes, I can't say I enjoyed it. The director shows tremendous imagination, but if he had fun with this movie, he couldn't share it with the audience or at least with me. I didn't get a sense of whim and I wasn't sucked into this universe. One big reason for this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can tell that she is trying very hard, but she seems to have been so displeased that she is almost amateurish. She is an accomplished actress, but she has her limitations. I have noticed in her play that she has not yet really responded to her co-stars, a mistake that creates a hole in chemistry. The language barrier in this movie seems to have only worsened matters. She and Odagiri act as if they were on separate planets. She is also not a very good singer who made me cut every time she sang, but fortunately there were not too many scenes of it. Odagiri was OK, but doesn't give much of an impression. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even worried about the characters separately. There is really a vicious lack of characterization. The only reason to worry about them seems to be that they are pretty generous. However, without the convincing love story in the middle of the film, it is difficult to fit what happens. The film also detours in smaller scenes that did not add anything to the story and were actually distracting. I had to rewind because I couldn't remember what they were in the big stories when they entered a subplot. There were also scenes where it was difficult to tell what the action was going on because it was so stylized. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind this and there are many things I like. Music and dance choreography is really good. The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, amazing in both the working aspect and the song. It's just bad that the main players were so boring.
