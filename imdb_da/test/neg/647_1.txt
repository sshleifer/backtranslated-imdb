My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples there and we all went at the same time. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I've ever gone on. <br /> <br /> Sitting through was just painful. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us going and asked if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> Never has it happened sooner or later Pleae does not rent this You will really regret it I am really sureprised by the poll summary Perhaps personal taste has something to do with it
