I don't understand what the big hype was about this movie. All horror sites said that this movie had all the essentials of an 'old American slasher' flick that would satisfy your needs. - Although it looked like an old American slasher flick, my needs were still not satisfied. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000s, not the 1980s. The horror of the 1980s is the past and should remain in the past. Horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic. Although they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same realistic bloodthirsty gore that the latest movies offer. <br /> <br /> The hatch is cheesy, unrealistic and downwardly horrible. If we wanted to see an old American slasher flick, I can just go back to Friday the 13th series, Nightmare on Elm street series or the Halloween series. I have to admit that the movie is better than some of the horror films being released, but it is among the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible. <br /> <br /> I would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
