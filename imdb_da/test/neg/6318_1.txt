I was 19 in 1970 when it came out and had heard how fun it was when it came out and read the reviews here, I finally rented it and saw it. I didn't even laugh - a very unfunny flick - and I usually love Reiner. For my life, I can't figure out why this is seen as fun. I didn't have a chuckle. And I love comedies! Oh well, at least now I know what it was all about. Not my idea of ​​a comedy. Go Camp The Navigator or The Love Nest by Buster Keaton - now these comedy classics! If you rent this - have a back-up rental so your entire evening is not a loss. Score 3 out of 10
