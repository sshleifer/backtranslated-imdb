Well, the first thing I saw after watching the DVD box was "Best Manuscript" and thought it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure there was once a good movie here, but after the incredibly bad actors and "video games" production values, it seems that Tron's retarded half brother looks. The first scene creates the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. Five minutes into it you will ask yourself, "What the hell am I looking at?" And it will just snowball from there. A horrible soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's "Dragula" rounds out this eerie piece of crap in a ridiculously bad movie. On a page note, # 3 most romantic quote in a movie - "I think you are the final destination."
