This must be the worst movie I've ever seen in Nielson. This movie just doesn't have what it takes to be fun. I think the naked guns and similar movies are that they didn't require Nielson to be fun. He just played the roles just as well as he could, while all the comedy that was going on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he should be fun, he is not. The movie only had a good deal, and this can be considered a spoiler of some, and the beginning credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated, it could have been good. I did not intend to watch this movie when I saw the ads for it and the only reason I saw it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio competition. This is the first and probably the only movie I've ever gone on. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a score of -100.
