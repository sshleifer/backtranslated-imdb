okay, let's cut for the hunt - i can't give this thing anything but 1 in 10; And yet you have to see it! The play is bad, but is not as bad as the manuscript, which itself fades before the production values. Cardboard Axes? yup, we got it then. Car floor mat painted silver and used as armor? here it is! <br /> <br /> The movie itself pretends to be artistic but is just cheap; The same shots are used repeatedly - especially in the drawn-out battle scenes; There is (luckily!) Very little dialogue and there is much artistic music to hit home horror! And yet, this horror is convincing - you have to look through it just for you to say you've seen it. I haven't even come across the harsh sets, the 'plot' or the risible special effects; This is really "how not to do" movie school. This must be seen - spread the word, and let the world all join together in astonishing what happens in the world at the end <br /> <br /> The best thing is, however, that they made a sequel.
