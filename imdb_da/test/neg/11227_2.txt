I've seen worse, which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this movie was. The reason is ridiculous: a student shoots a police officer and five more takes him into hostages? In a dimly lit, smoky New York school - and in a way, this clich√© hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? Are you serious? A daylong hostage situation - with a wounded NYPD officer no less, taking all day? I realize this movie was made before 9/11, but still. I watched the clock and wondered how they might pull this exaggerated plot for another hour and 10 minutes. The action was at best mediocre, and the signs were apparently thought up with seventh graders. The child-abuse child, the pregnant frightened girl, the violent gang of wannabe, a confused unfortunate victim, the cunning-demanding white guy. Please. <br /> <br /> Trying to make this hostage a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please - this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a child shooting a policeman. They are confused, ignorant idiots who become involved in a stupid - removed situation. Don't try to paint them suddenly as noble. The most ridiculous is Ziggy, who lives at the school's loft and admires Michaelangelo so much that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. You have to fool me. <br /> <br /> "No racism" sign in the protesting crowd? A black child shoots a black policeman and a black dealer tries to patch it all up. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the overall message that was poorly portrayed, though by some actors who have gone on respectable careers. <br /> <br /> However, was this a joke the red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was the child, false snow fell in his friend's arms on the roof, "promises me" etc. How original. <br /> <br /> The epilogue of "I went to jail, but now I am a lawyer at XYZ University" ... an appropriate way to end a joke of a movie.
