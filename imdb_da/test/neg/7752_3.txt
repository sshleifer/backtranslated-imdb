Albert Pyun presents his view of the lost city of Atlantis - and it is a vision so phoned with claustrophobic settings, weird costumes and noisy, "quirky" minor characters that one thing is certain: you'd rather get out there as soon as possible ( unfortunately it will take you about 80 minutes). "Alice in Wonderland" -like story is meandering and uninteresting, and there was probably no actress in the world who could have made this a good movie, even though Kathy Ireland does an appealing (annoying voice and all) attempt.
