This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. "Epic film about Russian culture", "Great saga of Russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me, this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy who is ready to create his peers because of a woman who does not even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film, history does not develop at all. People's festival scenes seem to boast about Russian immobility. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr Mikhalkov for his former works both as an actor and an instructor, but this film demonstrates only his ambitions to be considered "Tzar" by Russian cinema.
