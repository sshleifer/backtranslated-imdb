I watched this movie while I was in France, and I have to say it confused me. It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer, each ending in Morocco at the same time, running into each other and connecting. Simple enough? Now the problem is that this is the kind of movie that has ambiguity in both chronologies (the movie is not played in full order) and in fact (did what I just really did or was it just a dream?). Given these parameters, as well as the film being bilingual, it was really hard to follow and I wasn't sure what happened at the end. I imagine some deep artistic types could understand this movie better than I could, and it may require more than one view to understand.
