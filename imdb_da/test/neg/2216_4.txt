Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure played in the 70s, this is the most stagiest of all. It is so stagy that you can taste the dust from the sets and feel the hood of the lamps above. The case looks like a very, very large budget school game, or indeed a very very low budget action movie, as it actually is. It has been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entrances, and I hope it was. The genre did not die peacefully, but in terrible pain, amidst a lot of smoke, false blood and miserable sound effects. Peter Cushing must again have felt a boy as a nutty professor whose shirt turns white as snow after the gentlemen have pulled through the subterranean slimy creases. What sport was he to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely. <br /> <br /> Shot at a solid stage and accompanied by a trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this movie is the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters in a Burroughs fit, but they rarely manage to be so utterly ridiculous, helpless, or void of any credibility. At the elevated action battle scenes where McClure heroically attacks the creatures, one can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as the head on the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go into flames the moment they travel and fall. In fact, there is very unmotivated exploding, as the film (and the genre) draws towards the final. And lovely Miss Munroe loses her underground accent. The triple bill currently on the market includes this movie plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are pretty strong items, especially the first, with lots of money invested and occasionally even fascinating scripts. Don't expect any of these qualities from this movie. Get full of friends and laugh shamelessly at what you see. After all, the creators had no shame either.
