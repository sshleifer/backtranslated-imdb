Sometimes when a movie is crawled by the critics, you just have to see it to see if it really is as bad as the claim, well in this case. I think it was supposed to be a sex comedy, but it was neither sexy nor fun, I think I was chuckling once, when Johnny Vegas failed to stab a road fence and that was it. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes to living, each having a problem with their sex life; Dave has left his wife and is looking for an old flame that once invited him to heart three years earlier. Ferris lives with her sister-in-law who treats him as a sex object, Tolly has an obsession to involve strawberry jams in his meetings and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is actually stalking some poor women. <br /> <br /> The tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to "I don't think anyone could write it" an example of the latter is when they tell a toddler that his father is dead in a car accident, so for the stroke line when the boy asks how his mother is, they tell him she is in a coma. The blame for it all lands right at the author's feet, and the actors obviously have low choices who agree to be in this movie, but I didn't think their plays were so bad ... not that it was so good either. Surprisingly, for a rather sleazy movie about sex, there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic. I would definitely not recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity, although judged from other reviews, it seems to be a love for it or wonder the movie I suppose it would be better looked after a few beers and with your friends.
