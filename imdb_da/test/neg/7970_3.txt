Nor have I read the book on which the film is based or the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this movie with any expectations, maybe the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf and Nicolonsne's part) would be pictured. It wasn't, however, which wasn't a problem for me. What I am wondering is how the people behind this movie managed to make it, in my opinion, so much uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characteristic flat, despite great material and some very good actors. Scripture is simply not good enough. I agree with my Finnish neighbor's criticism - for many meaningless sex scenes (but only between women, while there is nothing explicitly at all about Harold's many love relationships), too many pointless scenes in general, too little information on the characters' background. It seems to be odd considering the quality of production - on the surface it looks like a really ambitious job, but the script is of course the most important, and this is where the movie fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold struck me as convincing, though they both work really well, especially her. The way they were explaining their unconditional love to each other in a rather sappy way, I thought, simply convincing. It is much more sensible that it should have been done through letters that tmmvds point out. I would also have wanted to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian ones as well as Mar - why ever a person is called Vita, called nickname Mar? It can be small things, but it does matter by contributing to the bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the movie with English subtitles, and where it apparently should have said Mitya, instead said Medea. It might explain my frustration with the nicknames to some extent - I couldn't understand why Vita was Greek, while violet was Russian!
