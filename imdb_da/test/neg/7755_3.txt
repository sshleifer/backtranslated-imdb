It started out as a good sketch comedy. The first few shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really fun was the Mariah Carey imitation and the take off at Beverly Hills 90210 with the hair struggle. Delta Burke vs William Conrad heavyweight match was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows went down relatively quickly. The script was uninspired and oh so predictable as if the show had acquired a cult successor in its young term. Nothing fresh was offered and the recurring sketches were boring. An example is the pistol family (or what it was called), which became a weekly function. This sketch was not that fun to begin with, let alone being a regular feature. An example of a fast-promising start saw a sudden fall.
