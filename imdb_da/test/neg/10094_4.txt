In a nutshell, the film is about a band war in the 1950s. Leon, head of Deuces, starts the band after his brother OD on "junk". He promises to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang just comes out of prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't do it for me. The "good boys" were no more good than the "bad boys". Very little proved that Deuces really cared for society. I suppose the authors went to realism here, but I just didn't care which side won. None of the characters were sympathetic or even able to draw my sympathy. <br /> <br /> On the plush side, courtship between Annie and Bobby had some talk dialogue, and the overall play was well done.
