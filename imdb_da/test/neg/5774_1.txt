And unfortunately I did. Any movie that relies on a bad proverb like its tagline or its title should be attributed to the $ 2.00 bin, but we decided to try another consecutive bad movie for the night. We had a winner in "House of the Dead" - go with one if you want a ridiculous flip. <br /> <br /> Some witch jumped into the water after being fired by Mr. Miner. Some guy took a dump in the woods. And the same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. I can't remember much else. The last third of the movie was completely unwieldy and we all waited for the pain to end.
