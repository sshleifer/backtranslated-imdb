With all the hype around the movie stars, this movie left me. I expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the Murphy, De Niro and Russo talents, but found that the film fell flat on the face. Comedy sequences were overdone, and the star's overall performances, especially De Niro and Russo, could not save this! <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
