This movie has been compared to the hilarious British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda", though I can't see why. The only connection I can find is Monty Python one (Eric Idle in "Nonne", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise, they are two incomparable. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of business before they end up killing, so they decide to tear off their boss and do for Rio. When the escape goes wrong, the two have to take refuge in a monastery as nuns. <br /> <br /> What initially promises to be a rebellion soon becomes a predictable, average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humor. Once again there are occasionally high spots, but neither throw nor crew manage to inspire procedures. An attempt at a "Wanda" type manic finish also fails with the efforts of "men in a row" humor, which is hardly surprising. When you think about it, men trying to be women are funny, men trying to be nuns are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
