Only to add to the chorus of people who found this to be "unmovable", I will specify the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS clearly indicated by some of the other commentators: "The movie" is shot on video (what type camera i dont know) but the cameraman had it on AUTOFOCUS (!) all the time so any kind of movement makes it go in and out of focus. In many of the scenes, the actors themselves do not focus on their scenes. This alone screams "Amateur". <br /> <br /> I also noticed that in the 'middle of the grain field' you can hear the sound of the gas generator operating the lights ... loud. /> <br /> Also, what about the individual light source that follows (and many times the 'actors') are walking around. It looks like a news archive with the "on camera light" that follows the people around as a spotlight. There was no 'credit' for lighting design / DP and I know why. The 'filmmakers' saw no reason to have anyone who actually knew what they were doing, lighting this picture (note, I didn't say "movie"). So be prepared for an EASY brilliant spotlight as the sole source of "movie lighting" for most of the movie. Uhhhh !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically inappropriate production I've ever seen commercially released. I bought this title because I like bad cinema. It's usually so bad that you can laugh at it. This is just so bad that it's unmatched. Plan you from outer space is the "Citizen Kane" in comparison to this title.
