Okay, it's terrible, and I mean terribly, easy to pick this movie apart. C'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis and actors in the lead like Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my personal favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, B-star John Agar is here as a sheriff to release the texan landscape of a robot-like monkey from a failed NASA experiment. The film has terrible performances, terrible scenes, terrible special effects and terrible lighting. I really can't find very good to say about the other than as bad movies going you could do much worse to find something terrible to sit through. It is sustainably short and has many moments of accidental humor. Lack of signals, lighting faux pas, offscreen terror, an incredible inane score, and of course John Agar tries his level best to be the core of the movie with a serious performance in the midst of this muck. The beginning is the hardest part to sit through as it seems that it takes forever for these two teenagers to get their comeuppance to travel in the forest down the Texas back roads, where great monkey will soon tear his revenge on his own terrible way ... Yeah for sure! Night Fright! Bah!
