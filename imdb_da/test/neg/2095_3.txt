Snakes on a Train (2006, Dir. The Mallachi Brothers) A zombie curse is placed on a woman who makes her have live snakes inside her. Brujo, who looks after her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several confrontations on the train, Brujo's collection of snakes manage to separate from their owner and go hunting. While all this happens, normal everyday passengers are relaxing, what is unknown to them is that something deadly is on their way and that their is not out. <br /> <br /> Having seen the wonderfully fun "Snakes" on a plane, I had to check this out. I knew it would be a rip-off and that the movie would look cheap, but what I found was the worst to see. The whole curse plot was stupid and should never be included. The special effects are not terrible, but are not the best appearance. I didn't have a clue about the end. It was silly to look and pathetic. The action was absolutely horrible and so bad. They just couldn't act to save their lives. If you want a good laugh, see it here, otherwise you really should avoid this. "We have a race track." I repeat. We have a race track.
