I can't believe I actually sat through this movie! It was absolutely horrible and completely cringe-worthy, and yet I sat through it and thought it would get better. It didn't, and I wasted 2 hours in my life. Will Smith is much better in action films - I loved him in I, Robot, Enemy of the State and Independence Day - and I don't think he can really be expected to hold a whole movie like the romantic lead in the way that Cary Grant could. Then again, the script was unbearably terrible, and the dialogue was so cheesy. <br /> <br /> I didn't like everybody, except Albert's character, and even I found was finished with a heavy hand. If you want to see a modern emotional romantic comedy, see something about how to lose a guy in ten days or when Harry met Sally. The 40-year-old virgin left me with a smile on my face. I even preferred music and lyrics to this - and yes, I know it's cheesy, but at least it didn't take seriously and was sweet. I also did not like the greatest woman leader - and was not convinced of chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think there were two scenes I liked (and certainly not the end, which was nauseating and compelling!) - Hitch calls Sarah when she hadn't given him a seat number, was pretty sweet, and - no excuse, this is the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Do not waste your time.
