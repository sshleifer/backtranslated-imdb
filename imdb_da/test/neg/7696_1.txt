This is a fact that this is the first Saudi feature film to appear in cinemas, but not in Saudi Arabia for a simple reason that we do not have cinema theaters in our great kingdom .. not just a cinema theater! The government banned open cinema theaters following Islamic extremists OR the religious police (or both) asked to close it in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Accused the seventh art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and things like that. I don't see a strong reason why we do not open cinema theaters !! .. we have many video stores throughout the kingdom, we watch movies on TV from some satellite channels, we can install the "Showtime" channels and after all movies it generally seems to be harmless in many ways .. I know many people how to go only to the neighboring countries to watch a couple of movies. I personally went to Bahrain several times to watch movies only in theaters because it was very fun as opposed to watching a movie home. Saudis pays the most expensive movie ticket in the world we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world has cinema theaters around each city. This is one of the problems we have !! .. The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a major company belonging to the Saudi tycoon prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the 8th richest man in the world). <br /> The movie title is a word literally means "how are you?" but it is also a snake meaning "what's up!", sometimes used as a snake to say "bad" about something and sometimes used as a snake to tell someone politely to think about his business and not to interfere in others' cases. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) and (what is there!) At the same time, however, I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> Male actors are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in Arabic realty more like "American Idol" he works on some TV programs like the Arabic version of "Cash Taxi". The other famous actor is Khaled Sami, who is fun and has a very good sense of humor. Other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less well-known and work on some TV shows. Female actresses are non-Saudi, and they did a very good job with the Saudi accent. Jordan's actress Mais Hamdan in leading role and Emeriti actress Fatima Al-Hawsani .. not that we don't have Saudi actresses but are few and not good. A Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi", who writes to Alriyadh Newspaper (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom), wrote about it and said, "Let's not expect much from the 1st Saudi feature film. It was born under exceptional circumstances "Therefore, we cannot judge it under the usual standards of any other movie. It is a fact that the film made a tremendous economic success in its first opening day only in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The film is fresh and is about a Saudi family agreement (interacting) with controversial fresh issues in Saudi Arabian society like: women driving cars, the low thinking about art, community guardian in a particular group and the differences between being conservative and being an extremist idea are good, but you feel lost in the middle One of the film's advantages is the beautiful music score of Rajeh Dawood, which was good, but sometimes it does not match or express what is on the picture Turki Al-Yusuf did a good piece of work. His performance was the best with Mais Hamdan. The biggest loser is the leading actor Hisham Abdulrahman, who came behind the supporting actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami, who did a good job in the framework of their roles. <br /> <br /> After all, "Keif al-hal?" even with all its drawbacks still an OK movie and it is a very good first step in Rotana .. and the movie was talk by people and streets, which is a golden goal of making a strong debate within the Saudi community of films generally until they become aware of the importance of the seventh art and other art "PS: there is another Saudi filmmaker" Abdullah Almohaisen "claims he directed the 1st Saudi movie titled" Shadows of Silence ". <br /> <br / > I haven't seen the movie yet .. I hope I've been helpful.
