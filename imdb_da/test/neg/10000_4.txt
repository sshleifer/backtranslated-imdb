This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there is really nothing worth seeing here. A complete waste of the then-plates of Ice-T and Ice Cube, each of which has proven many times that they are able to act and work well. Don't bother with this one, see New Jack City, Ricochet or see New York Undercover for Ice-T or Boyz n Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this movie shake its teeth, and I still wonder what the high Bill Paxton did in this movie? And why does he always play the same character? From foreigners in the future, every movie I've seen with Bill Paxton has played the same annoying character, and at least in foreigners his character died, making it something pleasing ... <br /> <br /> All in all second hand trash can. There are countless better movies to watch, and if you really want to watch this, see Judgment Night, which is practically a carbon copy, but has better plays and a better script. The only thing that made this worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, coming close to making up for the horrible movie itself - but not quite. 10.4.
