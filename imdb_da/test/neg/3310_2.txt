Great music, but are these people not pathetic?!? A real period of The Trippy Sixties, and it left me depressed. The director paints the wrong side of the jet life and sticks like a horn's nest. If the culture of time led people to do these things, it seems to me that it was a journey without discovery, only despair. I tried, really tried to like this movie, but these people are not everywhere on my side. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, go away for a while, but I always plan on coming back. Drugs are not the cause of these people's fallout, it's their miserable attitudes ?? These guys are passionately drinking their cup of poison. They cheaper their lives, and eventually cheap the journey that is life. Has the romance ever been so dark? Bowl: Interesting landscape. Wonderful soundtrack by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Caveats: Dated. Drugs. Depressing. Thoroughly unlikely signs; they are not flower children. <br /> <br /> Only for the curious, as most packages swim the Pink Floyd connection. (Rare Floyd tracks many will never have heard before since FM is not what it was.) <br /> <br /> Rating: Two Stars.
