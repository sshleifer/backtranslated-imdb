Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s Formerly VICTORIAN NOVELISTS, watching the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He chose these authors as the popular favorites in the first half of the Victorian period, and he explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are quite relevant to this day, but like any criticism, it also gives an idea of ​​the spirit of the critics' lifetime. <br /> <br /> Cecil believed in George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross) who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers, they are usually familiar with her shortest book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in some colleges. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, MILLEN FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE, are in print (for example, penguins have most of them in print), but are mostly unread . The most interesting day is her last novel, DERONDA, in which she discusses the Jews in English society and a beginning, pre-Hertzl-type Zionism. ROMOLA is her only attempt at a historical novel (about Savanarola's experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her meatiest novel is MIDDLEMARCH, worried about English communities in the provinces of 1832, the year of the major reform proposal by Lord Gray. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course. It is certainly a thought-provoking book (Virginia Woolf called it the most adult book in English). But it suffers (like all Eliot's novels) from a defect - she can't write lively, exciting prose. While Dickens is sometimes exaggerated, and Thackeray may become pompous and prolix, and Trollope may become (as Lord Cecil says) very common in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte may fail to explain certain relationships well, and Mrs Gaskell works best with female characters , everyone (and Emily Bronte in her single novel) holds the readers interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to eject sentences from blocks of marble with a toothpick! So far I've read about fifty pages MILL OF THE FLOSS. I note that one of the other reviewers has never finished the novel as well. But I have read a summary of what it is about. Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the key figures - they own the mill in the title. Although close to the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with a neighbor's son whose father is involved in legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom takes a weak view of this relationship, and the tragedy of history is about the split between siblings who culminated in their death at the end (Maggie runs back to the mill to save Tom during a heavy flood and they die together). It must have been a success with Victorian readers, but it is very gloomy and depressing for modern audiences. <br /> <br /> The movie slightly changed - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) eventually dies with her lover, and Tom (James Mason) notes their deaths in the conclusion of his record book. The story is completely rewritten, except for a double death in the flood at the end. It doesn't really help. Although Fitzgerald and Mason do well with their parts, they can't really pull the movie up by their work alone. The end result is a relatively small movie that fortunately did not hurt the manager's career. The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton, who two years earlier played David Copperfield as an adult over W.C.Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then Lawton never had a great movie career - he was just the case with being in pictures, some good, some mediocre.
