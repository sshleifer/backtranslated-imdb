We were happy to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so high here. Well, we got it home and couldn't believe what we saw. It basically comes as if it was written by an upset old guy who couldn't help insert his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an animated film that really lacks in plot and humor. The protagonist is everywhere ... for a moment he is like an immature little child, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, so heroic, so a perverted stalker. The worst part is all about sexual content. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has good sexual energy, but it's just presented in a way that is scary. Nipples slide, close-ups of a girls step (many times) in white panties or a swimsuit. It was completely out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to make some fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We are expecting something of a mature nature, but we just kept looking at each other and asked what was meant by this ... besides jiggling comic strips and poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon character cleavage and steps this is for you. If you're looking for something beyond that, this movie was empty. The signs and dialogue were simply annoying. <br /> <br />
