I was very impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical because of the exaggerated narrative and degradation of details such as the thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentional fun bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons shoot it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something about "Maybe at that moment, because the only time in her life Ma Barker became a real mother". This is supposed to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos when Ma finally understands how to destroy her family out of her own greed, but instead provokes that laughter. A very strange movie that rarely appears anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs can enjoy it, but more like a curiosity than a real movie.
