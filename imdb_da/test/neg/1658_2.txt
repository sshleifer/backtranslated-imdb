Infinite teens on summer vacation in a small Ohio town cannot find any meaningful ways to fill their time. Some are considering driving to Chicago; Others are happy to drink and bully their peers. In a random act of alcohol-burned arrogance, the bully races a homeless man and steals a strange book. The handwritten text turns out to contain archaic staves designed to summon demonic forces. One night or two later one of them reads an incantation and is fast filled. He becomes an evil killer and begins to calm down his former peers. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. The production values ​​are low, but the filmmakers were wise enough not to be ambitious. A little in the way of special props or shooting spaces were necessary. The action is particularly weak and there is almost nothing original in the manuscript. On the positive side, the special makeup effects are surprisingly good at low budget film standards. Despite this, gore is minimal. Makeup effects aside, there is little going for this movie, even for die-hard gore dogs. Not recommended.
