Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular. He has either the best agent in Hollywood or recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to look at the screen, he has little to no charisma and horrible comedic timing. The only movie he tried to anchor I removed was Waiting ... and that's almost entirely because I've been working in a restaurant. But I go down. Apart from it's terrible lead, this movie has lots of other debits. I understand it should be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean it has to completely offend our intelligence and has written so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. Lewis Black's great talent is also wasted here as he is at his most flammable when he is uninhibited, which the PG-13 class certainly does not allow. The movie's only bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost irrevocably to fans of the recent Superbad because of the weight he lost in the meantime). His one line was fun for the occasional, but was certainly not enough to make this anywhere bearable. If you just want to completely extinguish your brain (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you will enjoy it here, but I can't recommend it at all.
