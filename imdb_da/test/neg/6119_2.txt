I liked the whole thing created with Ceasar's Palace, the Roman guards and the trainers' ads. This event also marked the "torch passage" as far as WWF's voice goes. Gorilla Monsoon who had made the game for each WWF PPV until this point opens up and gives the typical introduction that makes it look like he's there to announce another PPV. But then Jim Ross introduces his WWF debut and JR continues to make the WWF commentary this day. But beyond that, this event is pure waste. Good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out of the window and into the birth of gimmicks. This for me was the event that WWF began to go down the toilet and not be restored before the age of the late 90s. Here is an overview of the event. IC title fight: Tatanka (Challenger) vs Shawn Michaels (champ): An okay opens, but considering what Shawn can do, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why WWF was hell bent on putting Tatanka over. They should realize that Shawn was the future, and Tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an Indian gimick. The end of the match itself was very lame. Shawn takes hold of the ref and pulls him out, so he is called to count. While it was fun to see Sherri being looked up after the words, this fight was just forgettable. Shawn had to carry this fight and had trouble doing so. <br /> <br /> Stenier Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers: Steiners gets the victory through a Frankenstein. This fight had been given a moment, but the audience didn't look like it. There was no heat behind it, I think it was a fight just to throw two teams in. Crush vs. Doink Clown: AWFUL! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This fight sucked completely. Two very lama gimmicks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The end all hit surprisingly. In the coming months, Crush was heeled and Doink turned face, but none of the fans seemed to care. Unfortunately, this was not the worst match on the card. Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backland: You have a brand new heel, there is much to go against a wrestler who was forgotten 10 years ago. The fans sneak and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like the Hogan / Rock in the WM18 and HHH / Owen in the WM14, the heel switch gets a strong bowl on the face. Fortunately, this match was short. The right guy won, but I wish they had Razor completely beat out and squash Backlund rather than win with a small package outside of nothing. Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs) vs Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake w / Jimmy Hart I still want to know the full story of what happened to Hogan's eye. Oh good. The crowd was really in this fight, but it had no power for what ever. Hogan and Beefcake obviously had ringing rings as both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least one year. Dibiase, as the great technical wrestler he was, helped carry the fight from being a complete waste. The end was a surprise with Dibiase and the IRS gained through DQ. But to satisfy the audience, Hogan and Beefcake made their usual games to the audience at the end as if they had won the battle. Lex Luger vs Mr. Perfect: The best part of this fight was the four hot chicks that followed Lex Luger to the ring. Apart from that, this was completely forgettable. Mr. Perfect gimmick was born for a heels, and he just lacked the warmth of a face. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what gimmick he is in. Luger wins through a fall, even though Perfect's feet were in the rope. So spend the perfect post battle getting his ass kicked. First Luger knocks him out with running elbow. So when Perfekt regains consciousness, he goes back to the locker room to find Luger only to get the shot that was knocked out of him by Shawn Michaels, to create an HBK / Perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic, but WWF abused. /> The Undertaker vs Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTELY CRAP !! What was the WWF mindset to bring in such a horrible break like Giant Gonzales. Sure he was size, but I'd rather see Brooklyn Brawler in a fight than him. This is not even worth commenting on. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Bret Hart (champion) vs Yokozuna (challenger) You have one of the biggest technical wrestlers who are always going against a guy who is only an advantage is that he is a giant pig ass. Bret was able to carry the fight, but a rather predictable ending with Mr. Fuji throw salt in Brets face. POST MATCH: Yokozuna vs Hulk Hogan Ren crap here. Hogan comes down to the ring with no apparent reason, and Mr. Fuji challenges him to a fight after Yoko has just won the title. Even the die-hard Hulkamaniacs find this to be total BS.
