There was a time in the US that everything was possible on film, so came roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scene. The most well-known is forcible attacks and hydropower, but of course these were made with a little budget. All shown at 42 in NY, but hey, there were other grindhouses out there that showed no budget roughies. Wet Wilderness is an example of that. It circulated the underground scene after a while, so copies were available, but as seen on other reviews, some copies were suddenly cut at the end. But the version I watched was finished. Now I will call this one more a porn, then a coarse, a serial killer around, but he likes more to see others having sex instead of killing them when he kills it is finished off the screen. The play is the worst I have ever seen. And I guessed that the so-called actors did not like what they were doing, for example, in the beginning, when we have the lesbian scene, watch a girl stop performing and pull a pubic hair out of her mouth and continue to do what happened or when mother rides the black man, the daughter in the grass sits irritated by ants! But it is the story that made this famous, incest and racism what it made it famous. When there is bloodshot see the two girls sitting there waiting for a queue to shop, God is worse, but still one if you are in sleaze and grindhouse. Make sure you have the full version.
