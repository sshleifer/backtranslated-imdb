I saw the trailer for this movie before I saw the Titanic, and I have to admit it was my appetite. Volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a damp squib. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterization is often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is just without a doubt - she must be 13 not 4. But then the scientists, firefighters and peripheral signs no longer offer. This movie is right in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because the two films are horrible. This has some reasonable effects, but generally it is 1 in 10. Don't waste your time
