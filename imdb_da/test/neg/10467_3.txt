Now before I tell you synopsis, this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater gets its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies even come on DVD. If I saw this in theaters, I would be very sorry. Bone Eater is about these people digging an old burial ground and finding some bones. It's Bone Eater, and the more legs he eats, the more powerful he gets. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought okay, the DVD looks scary and it sounds scary. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label, it looked scary. But when I played it in, I could agree with one thing - the title 'Bone Eater' is better than the movie itself. Tell me what's stupid? A bone eating that just attacks by throwing a leg, eating you and you disappearing? Don't worry, it's not a spoiler you see happening in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that 'Bone Eater' has a horse? Do you know what I think is the stupidest thing? The entire movie. <br /> <br /> CGI is horrible. Yes, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone Eater' was scary, but when you see the actual thing you think, this is a kind of action movie or just a cruel, average joke. The movie felt longer than the Titanic, and it was half an hour. When the movie actually has its moments of excitement, it just stops. I admit that the play was not the best, but actually decent, and that the violence was not over-the-top, but everything else is a stink. Overall Bone eater is a movie you can skip. If you like interesting movies with big creatures, great CGI and excitement 'Bone Eater' is a movie to skip. If you like bad movies, no matter how cheesy they are then 'Bone Eater' will satisfy.
