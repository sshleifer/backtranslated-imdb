For most, RoboCop 3 is the movie that is really the big disgrace to the Robo series. It has few fans, and most people hate it for the shameless commercial PG-13 approach. Now I don't have to say that RoboCop 3 is something good. Frankly, it sucks a lot. But in terms of being a properly shot and executed film, it surpasses this piece of chaos. Yes, the truth of the matter is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary successors to an almost masterpiece. So what if RoboCop 3 makes Robo a cartoon fast superhero in an ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy - at least make it open. I do not know where RoboCop 2 begins and ends, I do not know what or who it is about, I do not understand what is going on in it, I do not understand which jokes are conscious and which I am not going to be insane if I try to understand the characters, I see nothing of any value in anything that someone says, I can't believe anyone looked at the draft script and figured it would work, and I can't believe that Irvin Kirshner saw the result and figured that he liked what he sees. He probably didn't, by the way, either Miller or Weller or Allen did. It's not hard to see why. <br /> <br /> Now, RoboCop 2 has its fans, I know this. Mostly, they belong to this league with absolute anti-pretensions, dismissing anyone who was expecting a depth or object from the first film by Roger Roger Ebert Sith's apprentices. It's just a lot of fun, a good deal of action and good entertainment, the argument goes. Well, if you just don't listen to what some of the characters say, you can fool yourself that we might as well get Arnold in a suit instead of Weller. Don't make me wrong, I like a good action movie with pure entertainment value as it's only - most satisfying - virtue. But RoboCop 2, gentleman, is not such a thing. <br /> <br /> Look at the first few scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he is just a machine and then goes into this operative talk about how he could never be a man, after which Murphy's wife (who saw OCP for robotic stalk) goes into it blue and have this sad little moment with him, and then you will never be heard again! I will definitely go into this movie scene after the scene because everyone has these kinds of absurdities in them. It's like a twelve-year-old fan boy has made the manuscript, the characters seem completely random and first say this, say it. OCP wants to stop crime with a new Robo, especially this drug called "nuke", but then it seems that they really just want to become this great capitalist empire and control the whole city ?? The policy is abandoned I think understandably with the comic relief mayor, the villain (played by Tom Noonan who did a better version of this in the last action hero and it says a lot) is an abuser but is still used for this machine. The woman behind it all has an agenda that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Talking about twelve-year-olds, this film has the infamous role of "Hub", this black child who swears and kills people, played by a children's actor. I'm not going to be moral about it, it's a free world, and if you want a psycho in your action movie, go for it. I do not know how much Frank Miller's original vision was put into this, but the credits at least recognize him as the starting point for the "story". And if I zoom out, I could see this as a cold sign. It is certainly safe to have a madman, but then again it is RoboCop's world, and who would be surprised? All this business with OCP trying to become this huge monopoly over everything is properly dystopian and good. Also, the idea that RoboCop comes in contact with his wife and children, having them embedded in history somehow - would also be great, and as far as I can see a natural and logical step if they were to make one RoboCop-successor. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are only ideas. As many people have already said, the manuscript is 100% root. The child has a scene (the torture scene), where it is suggested that he is actually just a stereotyped smashed child, and then we have this unbelievable scene where he dies and becomes all soft and friendly to oil tin. Why doesn't he just pick up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath? Isn't that what his character would do? Does he give his life a second thought there on his death bed? Not necessarily because his last word is "it sucks", so why? It really makes no sense and it can be said of everyone, not everything in this movie. Is there a strike in the police force? Is RoboCop machine or man? What about turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I guess that's pretty funny, I wouldn't deny it. But why build it and discard it? And why in hell is Allen so criminally underutilized? and what is it Weller has an obvious desire to express with his character and yes, well, the threads are many and the mess is huge. This review is as shaken as the movie. The only reason I give an extra star up there is because of the actors of the first movie I'm sure they had good intentions with it. I think it is something stable, a kind of anchor in this sea of ​​poor filmmaking.
