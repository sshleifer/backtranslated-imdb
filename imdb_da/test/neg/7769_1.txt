I am really desperate for womankind when discussing this joke of a program as if it is intellectually engaging and promoting female liberation and independence. This show is the biggest offense for women in all the libido hip-hop videos. Speaking as a bunch of ruthless teenage boys over $ 100 lunches in swanky restaurants, indiscriminately buys shopping unnecessarily and jumps to bed with the closest man in the place who empowers, the fate of Western women can be doomed when we speak. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the harm it does to the female sex, Sex and the City are NOT entertaining. Not once has it been fun, captivating, exciting or original. The sections are played monotonously. Each character is factory made mannequins that behave the same way every episode. Not even have any of these superficial, unattractive women evolved. Perhaps the worst is Carrie Bradshaw. Apart from looking scary, her sense of over-analysis of relationships is worthy of dignity. On top of all this, the show portrays men as a bunch of empty led slobs that are unable to commit to healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted like a villain. The complete lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo-ministers. <br /> <br /> Part of the whole show is that these women live miserably miserable lives. Any intelligent woman will never envy them. It's a banal show with even more banal characters. NYC's Tourist Board must hate the way this waste shows their otherwise fine city! Fortunately, this train wreck is over! Desperate Housewives are seen as the appropriate substitute for SATC. While DH may be quite removed, it examines at least women in several ways. Plus it treats men more respectfully and it is actually entertaining!
