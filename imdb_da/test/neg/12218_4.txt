The real problem with this story is that there is not much history to history. There is hardly any plot to talk about. Widower buys an electric grandmother for his children. A child resists electric grandmother. Then she finally accepts her. Then the children grow up and grandmother leaves. Really, very little happens. It is much more a prerequisite than a story. Moreover, strip it of it's schmaltz and you have a story that had already been done before and better: The Lonely. The same basic idea: The person cannot initially accept the love of a robot, because it is just a machine, so it gives way to love the robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful as both the protagonist and we, the audience, are shocked abruptly to reality and forced to remember that the robot is ultimately a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story very flawless as the electric grandmother is just * also * perfect. She is not just "human", she is * super-human *. She is * smarter * than a real person, she has no trace of mechanics at all, and she makes marble out of thin air. Honestly, it's true to think she's a machine.
