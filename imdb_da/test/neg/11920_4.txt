!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The pastor goes like this: A store is being burned down, and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap that Sergio agrees with. There is a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to make this the sum of $ 25,000, but why? Come on, guys, if you were a beautiful white boy, would you risk getting a long magic in a hard prison (A very real possibility of arson) for 25 grand? I know I didn't want to, and since you had a criminal record, no employer would like to touch you with a barge, so $ 25,000 is so much for a life of work and welfare control? There is also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise, when Mister Lumpke told Sergio that his son did the fire, he thinks ignorant of the possibility that he might know too much. Don't alarm bells ring in your mind about someone who will keep you right if they tell you something? <br /> <br /> I suppose we are not thinking of thinking about such details as A PYROMANIAC's LOVE STORY is not suppossed to be an intelligent thriller, it's a light hearted romantic comedy / chick flick that's probably best regarded as a girls evening in. Looking through this comment page, it is obvious that the film has its defenders, but as a cynical man I was also not impressed and William Baldwin goes way above the top
