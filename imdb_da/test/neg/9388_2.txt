On the positive, I would say that it is quite enough to be visible. On the negative, it is inappropriate enough to regret another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I'm not saying this is bad, I really wanted to like this movie, it seemed to have everything for it, had the so-called "buzz" and it was also difficult to track. Had a little more effort gone into it on the side of history, I think this would have been fantastic. And I expect the team behind it to produce wonderful work in the future, they have the ability to do it. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this go.
