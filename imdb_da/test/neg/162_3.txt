I just finished watching The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and it felt like a task. Watching Keira Knight's unlikely skeletal-like character made me crawl even more through the coarse of the movie. It took me four nights to look at it, it was so boring. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. He is always good / trustworthy and looks serious in many movies. However, this was not good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unlikely signs, boring history, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt like I was spending my time watching this for nothing (as I did). I should have made it wise and turned it off, but I kept it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the big movie.
