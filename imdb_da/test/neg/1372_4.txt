This show reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons" where Smithers had just been fired by Mr. Burns and was forced to live a miserable life that was unemployed. All he did while the hours were going to drink and see Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a pathetic television channel for miserable people with nothing else to occupy their time. "Mind of Mencia" is a little better than most of Comedy Central's programming, but it still serves as an example of why this channel is low quality filler for people with absolutely no life. <br /> <br /> The truth is being told, Mencia is a rather competent comedian who throws out trite, softball ethnic jokes and cashes in gentle stereotypes of people based on their race, gender or economic status or a combination of two out of three of these properties. If you've heard one of these jokes from one of your friends in a bar or at work, believe me you've heard what's going on in the comedy about "Mind of Mencia." Carlos also tries to make fun of current events, but lacks creativity or originality. This is not to say that Carlos is a leaching all the time. I found some of his sketches entertaining, such as his rap video depiction as an oil sack. If you find bland, run-of-the-mill comedy in your alley, you'll probably enjoy "Mind of Mencia." For the people who are tired of repeatedly, pedestrians go out of the same old time-consuming jokes, stay away.
