Schieder delivers a semi-credible part as US president with politically correct Maria Conchita Alonzo as the female vice-president. The movie just stinks. With so many plot holes, it is strange that they made it stick to the movie it was shot at. Tired of late night HBO schedules, this movie is not worth watching at all. 10 minutes into it you ask yourself why it was written. 40 minutes into it, you wonder why you see it. Save the effort and see a re-run of Hee Haw or something. Something is better than this clunker.
