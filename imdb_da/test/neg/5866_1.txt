People where do I start, all about this cartoon from the episodes to the stories, the script, an animation is me the stupidest, stupidest and most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney Television Animation has ever created and done, I am so glad that both of Toon Disney (2006) and Disney Channel to stop the air in the US as of May 2008. <br /> Believe me, it is a wise choice to skip this outcast and black cloud of a cartoon if you don't see it I don't say I didn't warn you. <br /> <br /> Your in for a boring and down right boring and confusing time I want and pray that I never even saw one episode of this cartoon Buzz Lightyear of Star Command. If I could, I would have part of my brain removed, remembering to see it, yes it is, and it was so bad.
