Fellow Giallo fanatics: beware and / or proceed with caution ?? For this movie is not exactly what it seems to be. It looks like a Giallo, with its juicy VHS cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big blood knife), rhythmic title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but it's great just seen an erotic thriller without much of a plot. The version I looked at is probably hard censored ?? with a maturity of just under 77 minutes ?? But then there is still a serious lack of excitement, character development and most of all sadistic (and typically Giallo) carnage. "Eyes behind the wall" can be briefly summarized as the collection of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality problems. It is, nevertheless, an interesting effort because author / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and unfortunately pretty good. Inspired by Hitchcock's "Rear Window", the protagonist is a frustrated older and wheelchair bound writer. He and his much younger lover get their sexual kick from spying on the only male renter who lives across the road. However, the tenant respects doing gymnastics exercises around the house while they are close and clearly have bisexual wishes. Wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. Then there is also the Ottavio butler who repeatedly rapes school girls. Are there any normal signs in history? Well no, of course not! The movie enjoys a continuous spooky atmosphere with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography, but none of it ever leads, so it's just lax and sexless. There is a really bizarre twist / revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too random to increase overall quality. Not recommended for fans of Italian horror / cult cinema, but perhaps it's great viewing for psychology students, analyzing the Freud style characters.
