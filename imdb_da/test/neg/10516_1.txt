In a world full of movies - like "You Got Served" - blowing with its huge amount of errors, you'd never expect that there would be worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" do more than cheese you turn off. It knows you're angry with it. First: there is no assassin in this movie. In fact, there is only one good guy fighting the whole movie. Other: The location ... is basically one place: some jackass house (or basement. It's up to you.). Third: The special effects (excluded) can kiss my ass. Fourth: The play beats "Plan 9 from outer space" in the worst-performing category. Ron Hall can't act to save his life. Finally (and certainly not the smallest problem): EDITING. The person who edited this movie hopes better that I will never find him. Cuts and shots are HORRENDOUS !!!! Other issues: Light (almost none), the fact that the guy on the cover is not even in the movie, and the fact that this movie exists. <br /> <br /> To sum up this movie, just let me say I tortured the DVD copy before I took it back to Hollywood Video (don't worry! I used the MVP membership so it was free!) . NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
