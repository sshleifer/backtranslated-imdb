Plot: <br /> <br /> - An eBay Chair <br /> <br /> - Random People <br /> <br /> - Random People Speaking ("Dude, That's Right." "I Am Feel it. "" Let's marry now! ") <br /> <br /> - If you're a" hippie "then you'll love this movie. (You have to be tall or full, otherwise you will question your life at this junk.) <br /> <br /> This movie was obviously not well thought out from the beginning to the end, and the other comments are probably the crew reviews. If this was not aimed at my demographic, I do not know what it is meant for. I found the plot dull every day. It's something I wanted to do and trust me, it's not worth filming. Going on a road trip and filming half the silence doesn't make a movie!
