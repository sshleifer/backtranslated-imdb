There was a time when the Alien series was successful with even the third installment, Alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly because of its history, "top" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator were all very successful and created massive follow-ups among general movie fans and science fiction fans. Presumably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises, but the studios became untouched and then allowed to pander to the rumors among fans and combine the two. Steps in Paul W. S. Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now Brother Strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such deep and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of, first, a mediocre director, and now directors of novice have led only to nothing more than profanity characterized by incompetence. By witnessing Alien V's Predator Requiem (AVPR), de-hard fans will get sick in their stomachs, this series could have been worse. An example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The movie begins with an Alien that makes its way to the Predator ship, spurting from the predator's chest, growing into a full-grown predatory and bringing down the predator vessel (which now appears to have far less predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this happens to the ship still in the earth's atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed the AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it does not risk exploiting any of the terms or subversions served in the two original films. The tired plot develops with dull tempo, only underlined by Alien and the Predator's imminent conflicts, and when it runs the risk of boring, we are either treated to an amazing blonde in a bikini or a quick shot. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative illumination, ie. members of the public hand over an elite military unit or the Predator does not comply with laws laid down in previous editions. This is a movie that has complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most basic rules of a successor, thus giving you the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as an independent function. Independently, the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul, and referring to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the film's over arching tale as it undermines the first achievement base for the first Alien. Because if the species had encountered before, in the first Alien movie they would have been more skilled and not so badly prepared when they encountered them. <br /> <br /> In a movie note, the movie is close to gloomy, I felt encouraged at some points to shine a torch on the screen, the lighting was so bad. By exploiting such gloomy and dark effects, the audience can feel as if they are being cheated out of some actions ?? which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the film's lack of budget. As with any science fiction surface, a scene is usually the most memorable, in this case it is probably the hospital's waterproofing scene as it ever so foolishly draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The management is poor, the performances weak and the manuscript messed up. AVPR is a product of a film production conveyor system where ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and pulled out blood clots because the certification does not allow it ?? a lower certification to achieve a larger audience. AVPR was purely business and no more.
