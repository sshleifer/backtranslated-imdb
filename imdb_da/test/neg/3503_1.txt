I'm surprised someone likes this movie. I never leave movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this abusive disaster. The white characters are sacred and the Asian characters are virtually non-existent and worthless to history. they exist only as objects, surprise. Characters of other races go much better. The turns were ridiculous and predictable. But if you read this, you already know it. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can't even make multicultural movies right. Do yourself a favor and see a much more honest take on race relationships, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle!
