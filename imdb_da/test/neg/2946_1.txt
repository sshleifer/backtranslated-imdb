Now you can really call a movie. I knew some of the movies that Japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad? I think I've been sleeping three times in this movie. No horror at all, a little bit percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. Action let's just admit it has some, but the scenes are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in their own role. They were not convincing. Scripture is also horrible. I think this movie can be great, really, but for the 60s (not 100% sure.) I do NOT recommend seeing it unless you will be bored as I did. I can't really see it well, this film got its rating. It's over, over, overrated !!!. It is of course a personal opinion. I will not offend anyone but who likes this crap? So I hope it helps someone who doesn't lose any time "enjoys" this movie. Nevertheless, it is your choice!
