Whoa, this is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen! The packaging for the film is better than the film itself. My boyfriend and I saw it last weekend, and we only continued to see it in the hope that it would get better ... it didn't ... The picture quality is poor; It seems that it was shot on video and transferred to movies. The lighting is not large, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The action itself was cheesy, but I think it's acceptable for "another" teenage horror flick. The sound was a big problem: Sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is fuzzy and / or muted. <br /> <br /> It has no real profit from its own; trying to ride coattails of "Sleepy Hollow." Don't bother with this one.
