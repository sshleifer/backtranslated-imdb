I watched this movie in 1956 and again on Cable a few days ago. The film has not improved with age. On the contrary. It's a real spaghetti epic. Trojans are heroic and sympathetic; The Greeks are unpleasant, petty and sneaky. <br /> <br /> So what if Paris ran with the king's wife? Hi ... love is love.
