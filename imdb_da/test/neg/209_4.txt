Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have merged for a much smarter effort because one slides in the B category and could have been done with non-name actors and a much smaller budget, yet 2 armored trucks and wasted Warehouse couldn't have coasted too much. When the authors failed to come up with a smart lift plan, they dramatically targeted the situation, but there was not much to do either. Fishbourne and Reno bring nothing to this movie except the media interest, they are only expensive advertising. Dillon is ok but it was a walk in the park. Choosing the protagonist, Ty Hackett, is quite uninspired and the final, with the "reward" being quite childish. Waste of time, money, actors and so on.
