Why on earth do five USs continue to repeat this? In fact, the title says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you've never heard of, and it looks like nothing. <br /> <br /> You'll see ninety minutes of changing places, most of them being blown up later in the movie. In the beginning you see a nice little farm typical of Berry, who in the film moved close to Paris, but then it does not survive the "transport" to the Isle de France, it explodes 1 minute later. There are also two gangsters who have no tongues, as if it would make sense in the world of SMS and Internet, let alone pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It just happens, nothing makes sense in this story. my only credit goes to the camera man, the camera is excellent.
