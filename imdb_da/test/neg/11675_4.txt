My wife and I met a professional production of "The Merry Widow" in 1982 - in English, but quite a translation. Only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this "adaptation". Most of the characters have been deleted along with the entire B plot and anything but one of the remaining characters has been renamed. Most of the characters in the film are not in the operetta either. The action has been moved from Paris to first Washington, DC and then to the fictional country Pontevedro, which the film has renamed "Marshovia" and only later to Paris. The net result is that we do not reach the beginning of the original game until about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the largest voltage source in the plot is also deleted. In the original year, Count Danilo and the heroine were very in love, but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor; It is his broken heart that has made him a careless playboy. Now as a widow, she is the richest woman in the world, she still loves him, and he still loves her, but his pride will not let him admit it to anyone, and she must use three actions to play mind games to break him down . The aristocrat's tropics with money problems, who will not admit that he is in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think, delivered the greatest stains of a significant proportion of Viennese operetta for decades after the 1906 "widow". In this movie they have never met before, which not only throws it all out, but almost all comedies. Lamas does a pretty decent job. <br /> <br /> An interesting musical point is that several times we hear a piece or "Tr√©s Parisien", an extra song written in English despite the title of the London premiere, which was not as far as I know as rule exists in American productions until the 1980s or so.
