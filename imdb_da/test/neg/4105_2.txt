This movie was really bad, clean and simple. How a movie like this becomes broad release is a wonder to me. It's a decent idea, but it just doesn't have the meat. However, Edward Burns is a decent actor. I liked his little role in saving private Ryan. <br /> <br /> Let's face the big problem here. <br /> <br /> The imagery was so incredibly bad, I thought I saw an old "Dinosaurs in 3D" CD-ROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean I've seen cut scenes in pre-2000 console game that has better-looking dinosaurs than this. I mean, heck ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one. <br /> <br /> The monkeys of the spouses were ridiculous. I thought they were a kind of ripoff creation from "Killer Instinct". I've seen better sokpuppet monsters now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know there are plenty of TV shows movies that are better than this. How does a gem like Scifi Channel's "The Shining" get such a small audience, but this load of "CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz" gets put into the open? It doesn't matter if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee
