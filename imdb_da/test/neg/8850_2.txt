Would be promising if it was a student movie. Never seems to know where it comes to next, as if they decided on each next scene when they made the movie. As a result, much repetition and a deadly pace. There is an absolutely confusing procedure by which ghosts affect people in this world: the Internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious graduate student, retirement, red space, dark spots and suicide. Good luck finding out the connections, or when a sign is a ghost yet or just seems odd. Signs have hardly happened, which could be ok, but they are completely uninteresting. It is far too long and ends when it reaches a promising scenario, even if the conclusion is uneven. Weakest moment: When the "boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.
