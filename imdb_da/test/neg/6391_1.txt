I'm never going to write a review of this movie. In fact, I was on the lookout for the name of the star in the movie, and then I started reading reviews ... I think I will never learn. This movie is horrible! I do not want to justify my remarks for specific reasons because I really find it hard to believe that anyone with every taste actually looks like this. A guilty pleasure? Okay, I guess. But a movie that is bad is wasted talent as well (Caine, Gelbart and Donen) is a cause for grief, not a pleasant diversion. A low point for everyone involved, except perhaps Bologna, who will be sitting on nights trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
