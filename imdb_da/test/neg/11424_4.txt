I, like many in the evening, braved the lush winter and long lines to see what I was expecting to be one of the best movies this year. But I was left unfortunately desiring in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (though there were very few). Let's start with what worked. First, Lycans: on point in every way ?? from their scary physicality to their purity. The action: sublime visceral ?? when it happened. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now, what didn't it (and there are plenty). This was less a movie and more a collage of sequences (and don't expect to see any supporting characters from the other movies except Raze and Tannis). Badly missed was a well-written story and something of real substance to bring these pieces together. The story seemed to start right in the middle ?? by the block where Lucian had made an effort to rebuild. Therefore, there was no connection; no tension; no sense of fraud ?? the units had to do all the other work. Furthermore, it ended where the highlight had to be started (which had to be after the celebration had simulated a little). Oh, and it was too short. The Purist will also find insult in some freedoms taken to certain facts that were previously revealed in the first two films, but judge it himself. Ultimately, this film lingers long on what should have been short "background scenes" (eg various council scenes), and as a result, we never really got to know or care about the main players ... or the movie (ouch). -D
