This movie has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately it is not much of a movie. It is more of a documentary under the cover of a story. Bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece of celluloid. But your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more convincing and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to pass on the viewer to the difficulties of African life, especially Mali's country, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8 and the World Bank using the introduction of a mock attempt against the above. There is an extra 10 minutes scattered throughout the film, making a half-hearted attempt at a narrative picture and a bizarre Hollywood shooter game where the director seems quite happy with his own wisdom (ie the frequent Godard comparisons). <br /> <br /> Of course, as the movie begins, what and who is trying is never explained, but as we know now, the French refuse to donate to their audience. <br /> <br /> There are many passionate arguments, but they are often long-winded, delivered in a sharp monotone (one that becomes quite easy to tune out after a while) and very easy on details. The last point is the most frustrating of all, as there is a very well-founded special case that has to be done to the institutions during the trial here. Unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and G8 are evil oppressors and should forgive the 3-world debt. We get no more than occasional hint of the specific reasons why the judicial organizations are guilty, but never a clear case. The mock-trial arguments and images in the surrounding village make the suffering of these African residents clear, but one wonders why we should sit for 2 hours of it, as a much more precise picture could be painted in a 20-minute news article, or Bill Moyers episode. In the end, there is something very important to say about this issue, it is simply not presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious, indulgent piece.
