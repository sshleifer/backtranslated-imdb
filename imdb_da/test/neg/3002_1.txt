Priestly storytelling like this always uses the same technique: 1) Discard opaque, unstructured threads to confuse the audience. 2) Deal only in "big" topics like life, death and God. 3) Let it seem deep with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) Depending on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefits of the doubt. 5) And finally, laugh all the way to critical recognition. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretentious faux-intellectualism on its coolest. Not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions they are afraid to ask the questions at first. The movie is held together by the wisps. The guidelines are raised and dropped awkwardly. Pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary. There is so little to point out that any critical staff will miss. Critics who have found an intellectual base for this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this film is about. Good news: Don't be filmmakers either. Satisfactory attempts to answer deep questions about human existence require demand, intellect, poetry and genius. Unfortunately, this film shows none of these features.
