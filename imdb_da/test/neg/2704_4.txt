Although this movie is inaccurate, there are some things that can be true. He was certainly a wild sign in his youth, playing practical jokes on his co-cats at West Point, almost expelled several times, finishing his class (34 years) and often reckless in his leadership during the civil war. But the story may have made him a scape goat in the Indian wars. Admittedly, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under order? There is also evidence that he testified to the congress (with great risk for his commission and command) that he argued for the justice of breaking treaties with the Indians, and that if he were Indians, he would also struggle to live on a reservation! As a sign in the play 1776, when asked what would be said about the British about losing the Revolutionary War, the sign says "the story will do what it always does ... it will lie." Who knows how bad a man Custer was. He was certainly not the sympathetic character portrayed by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely evil when he was later portrayed.
