So, you've seen the Romero movies, yes? And you've seen Jacob's ladder, right? And the later Hellraiser movies? Okay, let's now make a movie out of all three, let's just pity everything and make a big mess of it, sounds like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. Absolutely god-horrible. Yes, it's an indie-flick who gives a shit? Is it a model to make cinematic excrement? The film tries to create credibility by focusing on character interaction, so much is clear. Unfortunately, the authors are not good at character interaction. This is not the night of the living dead; The characters are nonentities shouting their inner lines on each other in a vain attempt to get caught by microphones on sets. The dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses so much on character interaction, you think the characters would have something more to say than "WHAT TO DO". "" I don't know "" We've done something Well, what do we do? "" I DON'T KNOW. "" We must leave. "" Let's just accept our rate. "" No, we have to leave. "" Let's not leave it. "" No, maybe we should stay. " <br /> <br /> There is no exaggeration there are exchanges in this movie that reaches the level of redundancy and madness.The worst thing about this movie? Half of it is a dream and it has really zero purpose "Nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie. The authors could not decide whether to make a zombie film or a monster movie, and then they just made both. It is obviously ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and it is badly offensive, especially as I am quite sure that they broke the idea of ​​Jacob's ladder that handled the concept of a hell much more competent than these jokers could ever hope for. <br /> <br /> And so is The year of watching MTV and playing horror-themed video games must have inspired the filmmakers, but it's certainly a tris t things they did not do, what made it crooked with editing and confusion in these pieces of media effectively in the first place. In this movie you often get confused and not in the good David Lynch way, but in the bad "Wait, I thought she was just killed, no? So who the hell was that? Wait, who's that guy? he from? how did they come here? "kind of way. It is constant and consistently bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a ridiculous piece of waste and it should only be sought if you want to get the trash can with a few friends and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> And, as a last note, in terms of "comedy" that people in other reviews are talking about, it's all unintentional. There isn't a single deliberate piece of comedy in this movie. It must all be a big serious character study, because the filmmakers will have credibility in their horror concept. Unfortunately, their predictions do not match their ability.
