My boyfriend and I are really into cheesy horror flicks. Especially those with lots of unnecessary nudity. When we saw the box cover of this movie on blockbuster, we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We started to see it already, not expecting it to be big, but thought it would at least catch our interest. 20 minutes into the film, we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie. We tried to get into it, but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the DVD box over and over again. The movie was shot very dark and it was quite annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot. Every violent scene was very difficult to get out of and you never see the violence you expect. This is definitely a movie without a motif that was shot badly and much pulled out. Each scene was about 20 minutes of the same and I felt I got points after the first 5. Skip this movie and look again at a Freddy or Jason flick and you will be much more content.
