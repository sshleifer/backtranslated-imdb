Okay, how somebody can actually think that this movie is great is beyond me ... I can't even understand how anyone can find this movie extremely fun, the only sign it has to go for is the evil super nerd game designer and it gets old after a while. This movie is so predictable, punchlines are not fun, they are forced, you look better at the Red Light District, and the story sucks it is so predictable you know exactly what will happen. Even the characters don't respond as they should, try to go to the hot chick that is your boss at work and tell her you slam 2 crazy chicks you live with at the same time, her answer wouldn't be (smile) " Okay, let's get back to work. I didn't even laugh during this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent 3 $ renting it because it's not even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this movie, I have lost all respect for him. All his films are the same, his comedy style has grown old since Waterboy came out if I knew Adam Sandler had produced this before I rented it ... I hadn't wasted my time on it. This movie is just as bad as it might come from all aspects ... ace ventura was not a smart comedy movie, it didn't have a murder plot ... but it was original and it was fun. I don't hit the movie because it has 'low level' humor, I knock it because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood crap. If this movie was presented to a production company and you do not have "ADAM SANDLER" behind it, it would be thrown into the garbage faster than a used condom. If you want a good movie about pot culture, see Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you get is a generic 14-17-year-old comedy, with high rock music on every cut, making your eyes skewed and your stomach and comedy similar to See your rocky friend eating McDonalds for an hour and a half. Do not .... for God's love ... this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look past all of Hollywood's glory behind it ..... Hercules in New York used to be the worst movie I had ever seen But it's actually so bad, it's good. This was instead a very expensive movie that sucked as much, if not more.
