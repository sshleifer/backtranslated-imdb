I watched this movie a midnight, and I can say it's worse than other horror movies about a haunted house. Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actresses, but she can make the role better. The little girl gets worse, this is an example of a bad actress, she doesn't have the future in the big world of movies. DAMNED HOUSE CENTER: BAD
