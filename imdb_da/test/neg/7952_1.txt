... Or is it another way under the bottom of the barrel masterpiece? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972, a multitude of horrible horror films came, all lost again. Nothing else needs to be explained, asked or screamed loudly. If you followed closely my writings about CARNAVAL OF BLOOD or GURU THE MAD MONK, then you know what is in the store with SCREAM BABY SCREAM. The title sounds cool; It's just the weak script that should have gone somewhere else! Still, it's the hands down, the most terribly written piece of cinematic championship ever worked on film! <br /> <br /> If you thought this is an early slasher (which benefits the average IMDb user to write another comment), better luck next time! The real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie, which allegedly tells of a blue-faced psychopath to "kill" and make some ugly facial sculptures on its victims. It feels like you're seeing another early "SCOOBY-DOO" episode. My favorite scene is the monkey burst, where the four young hippie teenagers play. And listen to an actress named "Eugenie Wingate" to give us the worst facial makeover ever! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year-old rarity for a five bucks apartment cellar; It makes the perfect news item to go back to the psychedelic days of floral power, bad fashion and trashy music! Interesting notes: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also listed in the Tromas film archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when this reaches the top of the Bottom 100 List along with a few early 70's cheapies; Gosh knows they need to !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
