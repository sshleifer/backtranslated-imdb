This movie is DRILLING, DRILLING, DRILLING, DRILLING, and DRILLING !!! It's not the worse movie I've ever seen, on the contrary, but ....... how should I put this ....... THE LIVE! There is some very nice landscape and some wise peat, but it's about it. If it was announced as a travel suggestion, I would rate it a 7, but it should be a movie with a plot, some drama and for God's sake a point or a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments on this forum about these movies and I wondered if they saw the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie (gab) at your own risk ........ one thing for sure- it's really judged correctly = G RATING! (As most people stand for GOD TERRIBLE!)
