This was a very hyped movie prior to its release but turned out to be a dud. I never spoke to someone who ever liked this movie. I agree: I also didn't like it. Perhaps a great reason why it was not a casino success is that it had nothing but unpleasant signs in history. <br /> <br /> For a while there - I don't know if it's still true - I didn't have any movies where Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played anything but annoying characters. That, and a stupid story, make this movie a big disappointment, especially considering the great structure. Did the filmmakers filter this stupid really, that it would be a hit?
