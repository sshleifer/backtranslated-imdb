The only reason I saw this movie was because it had Giovanni Ribisi and it was supposed to be "Horror". Don't be fooled, this movie should be the worst horror movie I've seen. It is about these people who go to a secret location that has a "monster" in it. The monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants that has a craving for brains. Some people die, some people don't. Eventually they throw a monster out of an airplane and then happily fly away. BUT OH NO! THE SAMPLE NEVER SETS, AFTER FALLING A PLAN! Go spend 2 hours in a different way as watching paint dry on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.
