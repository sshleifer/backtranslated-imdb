Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humor. It's the most superficial humor television series ever made in history. The scenes are often obnoxious, and the terrible can of laughter sends chills through the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character, and one can only sympathize with how pathetic he is. It is amazing that such a low-quality TV series can be maintained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to see another episode, and one cannot fail to express disgust and shame as to why Rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2-dimensional, eerie and ridiculous character. Or pity yourself why you even had trouble seeing an episode. Looking at this is an aggravating experience.
