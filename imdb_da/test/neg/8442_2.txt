Let's see: what are the benefits of seeing Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you have never seen anything with Venezuela, there are many travel pictures from both the Caracas and the landscape (and the jungle side) and the various indigenous people at work and play, as well as lots of original wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a bit of a git (which he has always been used to doing). <br /> <br /> It's about it. If it wasn't for William Smith, it could probably be a collection movie for Save the Child or another organization that benefits the "Third World". The only time you really see titles fish is under the opening credits. No mutant killer fish as in Roger Corman's one-sided named Piranha. You would count on twice the fish in the title, there would be twice as many monster fishes in the characters, but unfortunately this is not the case. The story starts with a photojournalist and her brother comes to Venezuela to make a story of one of the last unspoiled places on the planet, but their motivation quickly changes to one that will find diamonds that seem to be pretty abundant there. There is not much of true action or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race is obscured by the mass of scenery and animal footage inserted into it to draw the movie's time. There is not much more action until the last fifteen minutes or so in the movie (which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the travel deals). In my opinion, the only ways a movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha is definitely qualified for the former badge, and is pretty damned close to the other. The only reason I don't want to judge it is a "1" is that the added recording is more interesting than the rest of the movie.
