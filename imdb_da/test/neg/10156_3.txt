oh yes it's fun. should have been a sadistic comedy, many horror movies lack sense sense, but I think a delayed pitcher would float around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends but i would not recommend it to anything else. This movie lacks all the content of a true horror movie, the excitement, the shock and the good characters. The killer failed to be the unstoppable force I expected him to be, and he seemed to be the average angry "D" student who could exclude only stupid people. And the really fun thing is the horrible spectacle and the lack of feelings of the so-called "victims" <br /> <br /> expect only this in the daily funnies.
