A mild-mannered NY lawyer (George Segal) slowly gets crazy. He promised his father on his death bed that he would never send their senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later, he takes care of a senile, dangerous psychopath. He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fall in love. But his mother scares her away. Segal is ready to kill her .... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... This is a comedy? I have nothing against sick, black humor, but move on ... there must be some limits! This movie goes out of its way to throw any tasteful, fun joke it can think of and rub your face into it. Too bad none of the jokes are funny. The jokes involve rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile old people, swearing and racism. Basically, it is a movie that seems smart by trying to shock people and think they will laugh at it. I was disgusted and didn't even laugh. The film is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. Cast is the only thing that kept me in mind. Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is also quite good. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not fun) was a pointless court with Rob Reiner Jr. (and try to see his then Penny Marshall as a spectator). In fact, this movie could have been worse- The original end had Segal gone to bed with his mother and pretending he's a pop! It was (fortunately) changed. <br /> <br /> A really miserable, sick movie. The bottom of the barrel. I give it a 1.
