This is what happens when a franchise becomes lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were played as horror films, with real frightening (albeit predictable), which was true to the film's theme. Then they ran out of people for the doll to steal and decided to play it for fun, with the next two being black comedies ..... That was what happened here, but I think it was not supposed to be that way . Kind of like saying "I would like to make pancakes for dessert! I did it on purpose!" When your souffle accidentally fizzles flat. But the milk was wasted and it had some value in the theaters as a goof. <br /> <br /> As the word ripped out under the passenger seats, I expected some kind of passengers to extend their legs through the hole, starting to run Flintstones-Style, to safely land the plane in the Alps. I did. It would fit into the stupid campy theme of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of pointing to the movie's obvious physical impossibilities, what about the social implausibilities? Like having George Kennedy's character calmly respond to the news that his date was a whore? Even back in 1979, a man would not easily accept the idea that he had just poured his heart out to a paid companion. He believed he had a connection with a genealogy, which subsequently turned out to be a mercenary worker with a com-on-line. Who wouldn't feel cheated by the experience? And yet he giggles and wraps his arms around his buddy as they pleasantly go away. What a cheap package of a sad scene. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for soufflé and served insipid cliché pancakes. And no, you didn't intentionally!
