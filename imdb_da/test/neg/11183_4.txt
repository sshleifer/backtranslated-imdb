Fred Astaire is reteamed with Rita Hayworth a year after their big hit for Columbia, "You'll Never Get Rich". It was the movie that put Hayworth on a Hollywood card, but her performance in this romantic music hardly suggests why she was so suddenly popular. Down Buenos Aires way, a tyrannical hotel owner requires that his four daughters marry in age; One might think that film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it is modern 1942. Astaire is an ex-hoofer-turning-gambler who goes back to dancing to make some money, mingled in the imitation of a letter-writing Admires to Hayworth's hard coal society beauty. Fred looks at Rita with a fraternal smile, but she is so mannequin-like (synchronizing with her songs as a spectacle-like doll) that all romantic sparks quickly sputter. However, they dance quite comfortably together, and Jerome Kern's score is immense, but not so bad. ** from ****
