This very easy story of Carmen begins on a high note with an unhappy, sexual frank dance between late-night prisoners "Karmen" and her female prison manager, but the live opening minutes never ignite in any cohesive film. One minute Karmen are all sexual predators, the next she dances in protest against her unjust government, and suddenly she is smuggling on the open sea ... Although the film deserves kudos to postulate the first carnivorous bisexual "Karma" broad lines it paints is so vignette-like and not supported by a narrative context that the film comes out as a schizophrenic, unshrunk melange of "Basic-Instinct", meets "Bound", meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.
