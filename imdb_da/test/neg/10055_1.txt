Veteran television director Ted Post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book of Plots. Faced with a tasteful Phoenix skyline, post-Charlie's Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star swing as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shaded at all times" while JFK impersonator James Francis's lounges surround the edge. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes west, abortions are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly raised by Sybil Danning until a giallo-style wrap brings the whole sadness to a bitter end. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and Bob Mitchum is also in there. Somewhere.
