The first time I saw this movie it was with this cute girl I was attracted to. We had a lot of fun laughing at it and generally making fun. So my impression was that it was terrible, but watched by osteynamic value. Then, as part of our anniversary, we watched video together again. As it turns out, the movie is just awful and unwatchable. It's amazing how sweet girls can change the way the world looks.
