I don't write reviews here often, but I can't stand by and let others suffer from this movie without at least trying to warn them. This movie is horrible and it's not because "I don't know what the director was trying to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; this movie is horrible because of poor direction, screenwriting and acting. This is the "trifecta" of bad move making and the reason why the movie was direct to video. It tries to be something like "High Voltage", "Hostel" and "TCSM" with some of these ideas lifted, but it just doesn't work. I didn't have high expectations or even midsize ones who went into the movie but were still very disappointed. It had the potential to be very good with a good attitude and good idea for a movie, but it was wasted.
