What on earth? Like looking at an episode of neighbors after drinking two bottles of cough medicine nightmare and having no sense at all. I waited for the clever part where everything fits in and saves the movie. Maybe it was there and I just missed it or was lost to me. My strongest suspicion is that it is a thin blurred attempt to market a new drug that is about to hit the street. I wouldn't say "don't see it" but I would say it's pretty poor at all levels - as if I'm dramatically in high def. Whack. Unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. Then it's just dandy.
