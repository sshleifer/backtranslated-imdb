This movie is retarded by a cheap movie trying to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot, but none of them are smokers just a lot of waste Thomas Hayden Church should not directly direct this movie, which is a waste of film . People who liked this movie gave good comments, but from all people here are some just retarded and not watching movies, so they think a bad movie is good, the actors suck and the movie sucks balls. <br /> <br /> I think many people get disturbed because this movie is trying to make itself look like the ultimate weed movie when it's just the worst movie about weeds I've ever seen. I hope people will stop the director from correcting the crap as this straight weed cannot make this movie fun or entertaining.
