I think a whole book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic movie on which this movie is loosely based. When Hollywood first started talking about such a business, the reaction was always negative, because there were too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and that is exactly where things start to lick here with the selection of actresses who can otherwise do remarkable work but who do not fit the parts, and unfortunately have been directed to the heavy hand of a director who does not understand or appreciate the source material. <br /> <br /> It looks like there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction taken is to wipe out everything that was good with the original movie. This is called an update, which lets us drain the story out of humor, snappy dialogue and any interesting premise. Most of all, let us prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't really get (at least seeing this movie) where the women really go. <br /> <br /> For starters, casting Meg Ryan in the central role shows almost fatal for the movie because in some way it seems to have locked itself into some kind of limbo, where women don't change real acting, even After 20 years of work in the films. Her Maria, who proved to be a difficult role in the 30s, somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes such as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing, and realizing that she had a choice in the case. It could not have been a choice that women would celebrate today, but it was fun to ride, and part of the fun was the catty, stupid and sometimes slapstick routines that raised the movie in the sublime kingdom. Here we are down to the ground with a spout. By changing the character of Sylvia, the film has lost a lot of spark and it is not at least Annette Ben's fault. I couldn't help admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handling. Luckily, I entertained myself by looking at some of her amazing clothes and remembering how talented this lady really was. Her Sylvia is clever, but flawless, and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately, English was not aware of its own work and lost control of the one sign that could have turned the film into a fresh direction. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all. In the original we have Joan Crawford probably one of the best performances of a woman. Her Crystal is legendary, with tricky lines, firewood moves, duplicate maneuvers and some very sexy bags. She was the connection between man and woman, and through her we knew what the whole disaster was about. She gave the tensions between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. An intelligent woman whom we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as beautiful as she is, is two-dimensional in this excursion due to weak writing, and once again some bad casting. There are several atrocities in the movie, such as the addition of a horrible role for Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives to have babies, and the rather annoying lesbian tour of Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie, when Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her makeup, shows the spark of what could have been. Her sour delivery reminds us of the simultaneous angle that the film could have taken. Her words revive and put a great demand in the movie, and it is exciting to see that it really can fly, so she's gone. She is in the movie for six minutes and she falls into the middle of the muddle. <br /> <br /> Here's a movie that raised our expectation and really disappointed us, a movie that could have joined successful "Sex in the City" that made a great transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and not compromised. It gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. It really updated what had made it successful before. "The women" in their current reincarnation have to go back and rework, just as "The Hulk" did this year, find more suitable artists, a really good writer and most of all someone who truly estimates what good movies are about.
