The biggest problem with this movie is that it's not like Bruce Allmighty. The first film played on every daydream's imagination to be able to control the environment that one considers appropriate. Evans experience, however, is completely different. He has none of the controls that Jim Carrey fools around, and instead, history is centered on the power of faith. Now it would have been fine when the first movie preached the same message. The problem is that the successor preaches at the expense of comic relief. And to add disgrace to harm, it also throws into the politics of the plot. You get the clear feeling that there is a clear message with this movie and it is the main purpose not to make you laugh. To sum up, this movie failed mix of Eddie Murphy's "The Distinguished Gentleman" and Charlton Heston's "The Ten Commandments". I'm not sure Steve Carrell's fault here, you get the feeling that it's his character that limits his skills as a comedian, the former news anchor Evan Baxter shouldn't be fun, he's basically an antagonist made for a protagonist who in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movie message should be about.
