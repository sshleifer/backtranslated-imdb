Genre: Cartoon card without dialogue, African girl and lion. Main characters: Inki, the lion and the minah bird. <br /> <br /> What happens: A lion will eat an African girl called Inki. There is also a confusing Minah bird. Is he on Inki's or lion's side ..? <br /> <br /> Message: Sleeves ?? My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, it is the right means of poor African people !! :-( I like how the main character, Inki (who is an African girl), is quite a big protagonist, but they still show her cheek and do not make a younger audience like her much just because she is I !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES !! I don't like the lion much and I think the minah bird is really right (I suppose). Personally, I prefer Charles M. Jones Looney Tune's cartoon in the future. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this one anyway, I recommend the YouTube site, just write "Inki" on the main site and you're there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones was nicer to Inki in this short. Recommended for: People who are interested in old cartoons and / or people who just crush You Tube.
