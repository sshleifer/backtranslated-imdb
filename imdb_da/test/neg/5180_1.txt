The Motion Picture Association of America has advised potential viewers and it is especially useful for parents and guardians that this movie, called "Frostbite", gets an "R" rating. "R" rating has specific information that allows any person who does not know anything about a movie to know anything about what this movie provides. "R" was introduced for sexual content, including nudity and pervert dialogue, language, gross sense of humor and drug use. There is no reward for seeing such a movie, although it would be helpful to know if this could be removed as an option at all, as this reviewer I would remove such an option. This is a movie where only a 1 was not equal to a number, as it did not qualify as a movie to be counted, in fact, as this purpose is with this movie, such a purpose should be with this movie place at all. This is an unfortunate and unwanted offer that should have been given a much stricter interpretation because it is by no means behavior or language suitable for viewing, and this kind of movie may want a blacklist rather than a stricter definition of its content . It is hereby proposed that the stricter definition would allow a criminal charge to be made thereby. way irregardless of its rating.This is an unfortunate world that would hurt any person who sees this movie as its purpose is to commit an offense. It is an offense and it is insulting in its purpose. There is no sense of humor in the movie, but a bad and indifferent purpose with its unwanted surface. Without reservation, this is not a list and may not be entirely necessary to say to any adult who is considering, but to anyone whose interests relate to the environment in which children are rearing does not allow or allow any young person to display this movie that is unfriendly . Society often sends the wrong message when these problems are in the public domain, don't let it be one of those times.
