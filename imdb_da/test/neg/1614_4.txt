One of my friends who is even more in the 1970s cult movies than myself, recommended this to me and actually gave me the copy of what I saw. But I wasn't so excited about the result as he did? or for that matter, Michael Elliott ?? was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974): yes, I would dare say that it served as the basis for the 2005 remake of the former much more than the "original "did! So we have a distant and abandoned wax museum of incredibly lively dummies (guess why it is?) With the seemingly harmless curator (a hammy Chuck Connors) being "invaded" by the mandatory group of stranded teens (among them Tanya Roberts). He also has a crazy brother? shades of PSYCHO (1960) incorporated with good measure, down to the very same twist ?? who is supposed to be a mechanical genius (shown in a "poltergeist" who inexplicably accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from a Pino Donaggio score, but being so derivative and not very well-made to start is essentially just a redundant (and rather confused) genre effort.
