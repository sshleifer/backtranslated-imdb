I rarely see a movie with such a cast, such a potentially strong story and based on a best-selling book that has been weak and to some extent invisible. <br /> <br /> The premise of a story sounds like a Brent Easton Ellis novel - a lot of drugs, hopelessness, and self-induced tragedy that a young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) is trying to cope with not suicidal to accept that she actually lives life and it is basically fun to be such a baby ... Christina Ricci not only plays a tragic personae, but also a tragic actor whose creepy and screeching for most of the movie In fact do you want to shout - kill yourself already and let's get to the credits rolling ... The director is without help as he delivers absolutely no pace and the story feels so uneven that you have no idea what this damn girl is actually about. The director was apparently on Prozac when he instructed this imitation of a movie and thus let the film go on autopilot, making it an unbearable mess. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming features are a sympathetic Jason Biggs, like Wurtzel's boyfriend (who happily decided to dump the self-abandoned egocentric egomaniac) and an incredibly good Jessica Lange as the cry-baby mother. Apparently, Lange cannot be brought down by terrible writings, leaders, and expensive contributors. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it really is who Wurtzel is or was, but the movie has successfully made me completely uninterested in his writings. In the end, I finished watching this movie and immediately began to think: OK. Time to see something, it's actually about real problems ...
