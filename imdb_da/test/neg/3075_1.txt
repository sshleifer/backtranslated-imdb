Many years ago I caught a pretty well-made TV movie titled "Linda". It was made in 1973, and star Stella Stevens in the femme fatal title role. Imagine my surprise when, over ten years later, I saw the same story unfold on sennat tv. However, it was this 1993 version, starring Virginia Madsen. Don't make me wrong, I can handle remakes, even unclear ones. But this poorly written and poorly filmed retread made me apologize for both Madsen and co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, the dialogue here is clich√©, which makes me wonder: "Why did they bother to rewrite it?" Second, the camera's work is very heavy-handed, and the film store is poor. At times, I felt reminded of the student movie competition at the beginning of Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture". Finally, the draft looks either bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, the only one who looks like he's really enjoying the job is Ted McGinley. Of course, he stretches himself with his perfect work with "The Love Boat". Bottom line to borrow a criticism from Opus Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This movie makes film what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
