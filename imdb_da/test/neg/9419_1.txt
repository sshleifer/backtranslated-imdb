I had the dubious opportunity to watch this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a horrible script and make it one of the worst movies ever made. Not only is the action bad and the effects terrible, the film has more logical gaps than ten pounds imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie as an example of how NOT to make a movie and which director you shouldn't use in one of yours. <br /> <br /> During the last ten horrible minutes of the show, I turned off the TV. Calling it "pathetic" is a gross understatement.
