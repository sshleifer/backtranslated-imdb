First of all I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. But I don't say it was a "good" movie. I went into the theater with pretty low expectations (something I've learned to do). I am glad that I did, because the reason and development was not amazing. The wit was low-quality humor. But I was in the right mindset to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I wasn't the only one. In fact, the whole theater was laughing loudly. I didn't hear any complaint after the movie had come to an end. I even saw a guy fall out of his chair laughing! But again, I have to warn you, Grandmother's Boy is NOT a top quality movie. It's a fun (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. Oh, and don't take the kids to it.
