The Cheesiest movie I've ever seen, not scary, just bad. First movie made by WWE and trust me, the only person this movie can appeal to is wrestling fans. It has horrible plays and the worst management I've seen yet. I found myself laughing at the story and the bad actors. I saw that the WWE people were trying really hard to put a lot of the refraction movements into the killings and more camera effects. I think they copied a lot from quiet Hill. This movie is also not involved, so if you see it you will find yourself tuning because of the lack of Suspense. The end is the worst, whatever you come out, want your money back
