If you are going to make a movie from a book, make sure the characters are consistent with that book. This movie not only defied the biblical story that has been told thousands of thousands of years to children in some way, but it clearly took liberties, which no adjustment would ever ever attempt. At least, the ringmaster is close to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this "Noah's Ark" tried to.
