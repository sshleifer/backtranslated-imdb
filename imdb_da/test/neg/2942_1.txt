"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've seen! The support is not only weak but also the signs. I'm sorry to say to Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've seen in my life. I'm sorry Edison; Your role in this movie was disappointing. Edison does not fight at all in this movie and I am sure that if they did not have Kazaf in the movie, the plot would not be very different. The main plot of the film has not been explained nearly enough, and the whole film focused too much on Helen and Kazaf's growing relationship. I mean who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yes, he is the prince right? So what! <br /> <br /> Certain scenes in this movie were just stupid. Yes, the action was amazing, but the whole contour was stupid. In a scene towards the end, Duke Dekotes says Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes it seems so now that he is an adult. Why do you want to wait until he's grown up to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen what were the creatures that persistently followed them. How can you be so naive that you don't know they are vampires? People die around them with bite marks on their necks; surely the news would be on it faster than you can say "vampire". The characters were another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's boyfriend. What kind of girl wouldn't be afraid of vampires, especially if it's your brother's job killing them? I bet you wouldn't find such a brave girl like Helen if you were looking for your whole life. Helen is annoying, bitchy, and is a total drama queen in the movie. She tries too hard to be different and ultimately fails. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've seen in any movie. Why should you bite a person's neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that her reaction to Kazaf's confession does not kill him. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another silly sign in history. How degrading for a young actor like himself playing in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. He does not stand up for himself throughout the film and does not fight. Even though I'm a fan of Edison, I wouldn't have a man lying on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Their love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is beautiful and doesn't try too hard like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is clever and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the movie. A plot error was Reeves death. The film had absolutely no substance yet, but it was judged by removing one of the only sympathetic characters. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story did not focus much on him and therefore made his wish to make Kazaf's "rock" seem irrelevant. <br /> <br /> It's very boring because at the end of the movie I forced myself to watch because I so desperately wanted to see Kazaf fight. The end was so abrupt because the whole time I expected so great to happen. Kazaf, the supposed vampire prince, does nothing for the movie, and I'm sure if he was taken out, the movie wouldn't be very different. I strongly advise you not to waste your time on this movie I have. I was very disappointed. If you're looking for a great movie, why not see "The Lord of the Rings" or "The Pirates of the Caribbean?" Likeable character with a well-written plot.
