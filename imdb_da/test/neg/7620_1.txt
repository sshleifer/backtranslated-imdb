Do you know what farmers are spraying on fields? That's right - Fertilizer, so when the BBC decided to make a very hyped conspiracy thriller about GMOs and breeding what we got was some of the smelly fertilizers the BBC has inflicted on its audience <br /> <br /> !! !! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> GOLD Fields opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a laboratory where a female scientist (right on trendy BBC's all scientists are women) announces "A new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger" Then the story shifts to another equally bland scene. If you want to make a thriller of any type, don't open a hook that grabs the audience? Doctors who were brilliant at this, were THE X-FILES while opening 28 days later with a hook that took place in a laboratory. I think someone at the BBC didn't think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed in their throats for weeks in advance. As the (not very exciting) story continues a couple of journalists (A drunken man of morality lower than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush combined, while the other is a female journalist full of virtue), patients in a county hospital who may be hit by "Mercy killings". It is at this time that things start to get confused as the female journalist is threatened by MI5 ghosts, and the first episode ends with the main MI5 ghost being murdered. The second episode shows that the patients in the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a VRSA superbug. It is here when things go completely hay wire. Throughout GOLDEN'S COMMUNITIES, the audience has been led to believe in the intelligence service, and the company in the opening order has been behind the deaths - but they are not. It turns out that the bad guy is an organic farmer who has produced VRSA superbug in his bedroom, and the story ends via the MATRIX camera's work with the drunk male journalist who fires a field run with VRSA and thereby spreading the superb oven across the country <br /> <br /> I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD. At the time of the broadcast, I was both a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. I have since called off my time in the environmental movement, but even now I'm slightly offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to get the bad guy to spread a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning of the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very stupid. It's a bit like a CND member who lets go of a key in London to warn about the dangers of nuclear war. I was also slightly offended by how the male characters were written as bastards, while all females were very intelligent and morally superior to men. There are also other issues with the script, especially with regard to VRSA. If, unlike the screenwriters, you take time and trouble to examine VRSA, you find it quite different from what is seen here. Oh, and if you fire diesel, it won't explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the manuscript is that it resembles JEEPERS CREEPERS structural, whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before. Wherever JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes GOLDEN GOLD lasted twice as long, so it is twice annoying and illogical. As a footnote, the environment never makes a good theme for a thriller (Someone remembers the Steven Segal movies?) And it's time TV and movie producers realized this
