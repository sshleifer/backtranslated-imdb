Ok see this show is the worst show at nick @ night. I love so many shows at Nick @ Night and I love them. When this show came on nick @ night I was so annoyed. It's such a boring show, and it's corny. Out of all the times I've seen, I found an episode a little fun. This show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever. This show sums up to terrible. Give props to Fresh Prince of Bel-air and George Lopez. This show is boring and not least smart. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I don't think it deserves to be played at nick @ night along with some great classic shows. This show lacks wisdom, good jokes and style.
