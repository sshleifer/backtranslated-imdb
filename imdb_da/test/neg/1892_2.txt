I'm not fussy with movies, I have seen so much scratch I could see something. Maybe that was why I saw this at the end. I'm also a big fan of RPG games, but this movie is a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGs there are. The security camera's recordings of a game game would make it feel more realistic than this movie does. The lines, the cuts, the sound, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was filmed in a picture when !!!!! (spoilers ahead) !!!!! People running around do not disturb people sitting near computers. I mean, would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you? oh and the jokes about pirates, it's the worst yet in movie !!!!! (spoilers end) !!!!! At least the first one felt like a documentary, now it looks like some home video experiment. You can find better movies on youtube. Top line: Don't waste your time and money on it, it's as bad as it gets.
