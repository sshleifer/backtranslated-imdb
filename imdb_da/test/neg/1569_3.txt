George & Mildred - The Movie lacks the talents of its television writer John Mortimer, bringing the neighborhood cut and bumps into George's class war with the four million living. <br /> <br /> The reason is cut from standard spin-off cloth - hit-man / erroneous identity - and has as little tension as there is laughing. The producers should have taken a magazine from Rising Damp (also 1980), which was also bought for the big screen after the TV show's departure, and kept much of the story in familiar setting. Yootha Joyce died in 1980, but she should not be remembered for this creaking job as she was at her illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of her television incarnation; cut apart and evasively looks almost like Georges' lack of libido. George's sputtering incredulity is also lost in the more expansive sets. This is not to say that they were much to shout for. The budget for these films looks pathetically small; A restaurant they go to is obviously a new half-rigged house with some Christmas lights that provide the front door. <br /> <br /> For fans of the 70's British comedy or those who just want to visit an old TV companion from their youth this movie can't add anything to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tvs series now on DVD.
