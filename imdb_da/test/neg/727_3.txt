When I first look at this series, the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny, especially Lorelai and Rory were witty and intelligent conversationalist, albeit a bit talkative. However, having seen it for some time, my opinion changed. The protagonists slowly appeared as self-centered self-confessed narcissists who treated small wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence. For example, Rory would not talk to her mother for months when Lorelai did not have her with her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai dumped Luke just to have little time to adapt to his new life. These people are superficial and see themselves as the center of the universe, where everyone else must behave precisely according to their own rigid rules, and if they do not, they will be angry with them for eternity. They do not want to see others' problems and treat the least weaknesses as the most serious offense. Most of the characters lack the ability to behave in an adult way. They think they should do what they want and everyone else is condemned. The series is character-based, so when the main characters became so odd, the show was also impossible to see. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt if I will ever finish watching them. I also want to keep someone who thinks a lot about the show and its horrible characters with the greatest suspicion - they must be as wild as Lorelai et al.
