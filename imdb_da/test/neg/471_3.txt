This could have been a great movie with lots of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution, biology, the creative work of science, research and Darwin's life, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The play is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a Mexican soup melodrama. Although it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious belief, it was largely due to his achievements during the Beagle journey and not only because of the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but he did not literally insane, mislead and detach him from his friends and family. Such a depiction of Darwin is an invention of the scriptwriter. Thus, it cannot in any way be used as a place to learn a little about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had the theory ready at the end of the Beagle journey and kept it out of public because he wanted to develop the consequences and control against more data. In the film, there is an imaginary conflict in Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness he developed after the death of his death, keeping him out of public. <br /> <br /> The film brings a modern situation, the creationists vs. scientists debate, into Darwin's life and times, so it is anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology, but as someone eager to "kill God" in his own words from the movie and destroy the church, who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of lots of decoupled data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensitive person, a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak against religion. In fact, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and before Darwin's work, he believed that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first evolution support was published one month after the origin of the origin became public. He was an agnostic, but did not think it was necessary "to kill God," only believed that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate creationists vs. scientists appear throughout the movie, and creationist's catch phrases like "It's only a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, no such dispute or catch phrase existed at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive review of the original word that they saw God's work in evolution, in some way, in fact, contrary to the way in which the priests are portrayed in the manuscript. <br /> <br /> Another horrible aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the public that scientific research is made by a lonely crazy man who just writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The notion of evolution theory was the result of thorough observations of living forms of Darwin over five years in HMS Beagle and was progressively developed as can be seen from Darwin's voyage notes. Although the Beagle journey was the only most important part of Darwin's life to perceive the "origin of the origin", the journey is briefly mentioned only once in the beginning, and no attempt has been made to show that the book came as a detailed analysis of observations. To make matters worse, Darwin shows a single experiment (puppet breeding) to test his theory and eventually ends it. And I'm not quite sure if such an experiment actually occurred. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment. It is in no way a tribute to Darwin and science.
