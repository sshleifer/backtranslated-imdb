I saw this turkey in the theater, but I was fine. The special effects are not worthy of a school production. A toy boat representing a cargo vessel moves at speedboat speed on flat water, while wind-driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add extra dramatic pressure. Whichever cache Vincent Price should bring as a narrator, it is completely overshadowed by terrible production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me very much fun. Perhaps it was the far too dramatic intonation of the often used line. "They disappeared in the devil's triangle!" [Cut into black, next story]. When I started laughing, my friends entered. Next time Vinny said the decisive line someone in back yelled out, "Good!" Then it was almost as many laughs as a Marx Brothers movie. No one was in the terribly serious second function "the wagons of Greece".
