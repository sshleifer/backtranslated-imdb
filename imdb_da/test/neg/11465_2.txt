So right here at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new about this movie at all. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword, the evil ones seem to die with a few slashes, he continues to look the same (ish)! There are several action scenes, but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that when they cannot disturb choreographing a battle scene, they just move the camera close to each other, move fast and turn the music up ......... It makes me feel confused once again. <br /> <br /> I admire them for trying to tackle a dark story without the normal Hollywood cheese, but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are 2-dimensional. We hardly learn them or feel for them at all. The management has a charming farmer accent oo arrr ..... although it seems he doesn't have much to say ... Don't bother to see this unless you get bored and got half the price from blockbusters ....
