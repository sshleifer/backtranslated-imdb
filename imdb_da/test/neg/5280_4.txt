Stupid horror movie about five 20 somethings (3 guys, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they do not know is Dr. Chopper and his female assistants attacked and killed someone who ventures into their forest. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something. Also, five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be knocked off and show some cleavage. <br /> <br /> Pretty desperate. The story is confusing and boring; Gore is ridiculously false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants cross the TERRIBLY; There is something terribly black "humor" in here, and people are just standing around while their friends are being attacked or just standing there and letting the people kill them. <br /> <br /> It was pretty offensive. There are a few pluses. An hour's twist was pretty good, and the five young actors are actually good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is OK as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good when Tamara and Robert Adamson have their moments like Nicholas. Best of all, Chesley Crisp is like Jessica - she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five were successful and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue was not really there for them. I give it a 4 for their performances - but nothing else here is worth mentioning. Hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them.
