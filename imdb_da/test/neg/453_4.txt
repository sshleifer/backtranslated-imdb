I'm a big fan of when it comes to the Doctor Who series and still are. But I was very disappointed when I started to see this new series. Children under the age of 15 or better under the age of 10 will probably enjoy the best and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series. But for fans of the original series, this series will miss much of the charm that made the original series so great, it took David Tennant to make me appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a doctor in 1. season. I would only recommend this series to people who have not seen much of original series, people under 15 and very dying as fans, everyone else will just get a laugh and murmur curse words about Russel T. Davies turned up one of our favorite TV shows.
