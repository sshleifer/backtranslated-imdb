What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought that would ever come to this? A giant mess that loses halfway and cannot recover. I was surprised at how bad this really was. Really! I never saw the end properly because this movie is just inadequate. I'm a big fan of the first, but it's a lama excuse for a successor. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the hoist if they were to give back the money? The movie is just boring and so pull together that I can never sit on this. It's really bad. Stay as far, repeat as far as possible from this movie. It is worthless.
