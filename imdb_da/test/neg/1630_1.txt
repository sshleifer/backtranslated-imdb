I saw this late, late, late, late show back when MST3K was just a glimpse of Joel Hodgson's eye. I had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "to the ends of the earth" in an hour and a half (God God said her father gave such specific directions) and then take days to get it back to the castle with help. I didn't know that a swarming barbaric type could run into the woods and create a hanglider and flash powder bombs in under 30 seconds. I had no idea how unfortunate a movie could be. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing kids, a very bad thing. If you enjoy bad movies, go for it.
