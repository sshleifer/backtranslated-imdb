Sex life of potato men is about the sexual life of several men involved in delivering potatoes. So there are no surprises there. It's actually pretty much what you might expect from the title: it's a quirky comedy that involves sex and potato men. At times the movie works. It's an edgy, sometimes unpleasant, comedy about the life of some rather insignificant and rather average men who have problems of various kinds with women. Where the movie apparently does not work and why it failed at the cashier's office, it is that the quirky, unpleasant parts may just be a shadow of quirky and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing at the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he loves his wife, I think most of us just groan awkwardly and wonder what Andy Humphries was thinking. Well, maybe we are shown what he thought too clearly.
