I saw the MST3K version of the movie and this review includes smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, it looked like it could have a promise like a cheesy sci-fi flick, but the more I saw it, the more disappointing it was. The first reason is pretty idiosyncratic - I liked the mousy shy girl with glasses much more than the model Wanda was at the end of the movie. Deeper it was that the loss of glasses and shifts in clothes replaced an actual character growth. Instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself, Wanda was just as addicted to men doing everything for her as she was at the start of the movie. The action could have been better (though I was tired of cracking across Ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself! It wasn't that bad.) The background was okay, but it was a little hokey (foreigners = people with face painting) and could have used more explanation. Maybe it was just that I was interested in the movie itself, but Joel and Bots did a little for me. The movie could have been better without them at all. <br /> <br /> Overall (for the movie itself, not MST3K), a 3 out of 10. It was an okay flick for what it was.
