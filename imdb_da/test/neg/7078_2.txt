I watched the movie yesterday and stopped it at half time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a movie through the eyes of a headsman - one of the "evil guys" through most fantasy and medieval films - is fantastic and offers plenty of opportunities, but ... the movie couldn't catch one of them. I didn't feel for any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point I followed it) and the second leap in history made me quit. Those who expect a deep insight into an emotional situation of a leader in the Middle Ages, a social exclusion at that time, may be disappointed.
