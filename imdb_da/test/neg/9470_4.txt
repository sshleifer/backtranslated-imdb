Telly Savalas pushes it up like the Mexican revolutionary (though he is matched by Chuck Connors as a military martin) in this joke yet slightly boring pastiche on the famous historical figure of life and times. An earlier attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and contributing Robert Mitchcum, these events treated more soberly and on a larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is an all too typical European venture and unspoilt, despite its credentials; The end result is usually silly rather than fun - however, a few moments, especially the action sets and a scene that involves a fight inside a church, give some mild pleasure. Oh, and Savalas even gets to sing in the end titles!
