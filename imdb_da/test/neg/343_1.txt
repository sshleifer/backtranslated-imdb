It's OK movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends. It is far below the limits called "professional". There is no plot, no actors play and visual look like you see it through the plastic film. I was so happy that I have the FF button on my remote control, 32x worked really well. I understand that everyone should start somewhere, but it should not be a reason to bring it to the public. If you have concerns about quality and budget - "Open Water" was made at $ 60,000 and more than half went to the guy who provided safety in the ocean and trained sharks. And that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indie film production.
