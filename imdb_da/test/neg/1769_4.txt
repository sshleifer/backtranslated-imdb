Normally, any movie with Steve Railsback in the lead is a good movie. However, this film is not consistent with this opinion. Lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to pick things up towards the end when London becomes Zombie City. A horror / sci-fi root that is very difficult to sit through, although the naked spacegirl / vampire is very easy to look at. This movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
