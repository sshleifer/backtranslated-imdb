There seems to have been some money behind this movie, but it would be impossible to imagine a movie that was poorly planned and executed if I hadn't started to see it. <br /> Initially, when we are in the cave of the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been in horror movies since the early 80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up . As the actors wear helmet lights, it means that everything we see is bright light that changes with full darkness - we never see what the characters see; so when they shout out "Look there!" we are back to ask "what?! where?!". In the end, the film has a nausea, confusing strobe-light effect, without reason until it reaches the end. <br /> <br /> And I don't want to tell you what the 'end' means - but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old early '60s Arch Hall grin party "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what crazy person would ever like to make a variation on a theme like "Eegah!" s, long remembered as one of the worst movies ever made?! But that's what we have here, people. Apart from that, unlike "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is no idea of ​​fun fun. It can't be packed. (I drove it at x2 the normal speed, just to get it over, hoping I could actually see something at the end of the movie, but when I did, it was just silly.) This movie gave me a satisfying moment, though as it only cost a few bucks when I got it out of the DVD player, I could smash it with my own hands - what a relief!
