** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** <br /> <br /> When fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name always comes up to Larry Buchanan. This amazing instructor has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap criminal dramas such as A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. With the prospect of Loch Ness being extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this shelf on a wide and round California lake. In the beginning, the film presents some dazzling (for the budget) underwater photography and creates an atmosphere in spite of itself. Then it degenerates into windy dialogue released by no-name actors with lapsing Scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that does nothing for the highly malignant bagpipe. At some point, campers sing "You take the highway, I take the low road" just to throw in another Scottish clich√©. If Scottish people ever choose to jump on political correctness wagon, they will sue Larry Buchanan over this movie, though his last name. The monster looks like a giant papier-mache puppet and it makes the dragon in Beanie & Cecil look scary in comparison. On an unforgettable scene, Nessie takes land and to escape some patrolling soldiers, the fifty-meter-long critter tries to hide behind a tree - and the soldiers don't see it! LOCH NESS HORROR is a true mind-boggler that must be seen - several times - being believed.
