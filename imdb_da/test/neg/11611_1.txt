I am by no means facetious when I say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, the hands of fate". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is horrible, I use the "To Girls" scale to find out. If the movie is comparable to "To Girls" then I will not see it. If that's twice as good, maybe I can see it, but only to laugh at the retarders who paid someone to do it, for a movie that's twice as good would still be a piece of waste.
