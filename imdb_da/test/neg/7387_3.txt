Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread, while disappointing for many, had its moments. Puddle Cruisers have fewer moments. I watched this movie on the shelf of my local video store and then at the bottom, it was made by the Broken Lizard group who made Super Troopers, so of course I picked it up. I found only one scene that laughs loudly, fun. Far from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of leisure and really need to kill some time. However, you have better opportunity to play video games or see something that can make you laugh or think.
