I really don't know why I'm writing this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this: <br /> <br /> Once I finish watching some movies, I like them. So, as time goes on, my opinion about the movie changes. This happened at the end of days I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But a few weeks later my opinion has changed. So to solve this I saw it again at a friend's house. Well, that's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm a logical person. If I see a logical hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. If I see two, I'm starting to get annoyed. More than two and I'm off. End of days made me turn off after my second viewing. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is a bit depressing. Everything knows it's sad. Everything from Arnold's appearance to the film's colors. But dark-looking movies do not disturb me, but some other things ... If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you possibly kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him, his skin grows back. If you cut off your head, a new one must come up again. So the question: what is the purpose of even trying to kill him? I will tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain. This is not the devil my friends. This is a man reminiscent of the Bond villains who give away the whole scheme to the hero. As I said, it's worth seeing, but don't see it twice because it's bad.
