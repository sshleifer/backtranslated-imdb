Even a horrible one is too much for this movie, everything from start to finish has made you hug. I don't think it would be possible to get more overly cliched moments into a single mind that numbingly numbingly let go of movies. Prison cell block H meets Thunderbirds, hell, even Virgil's expression was more life-like than his son. <br /> <br /> I haven't even finished seeing this and I'm here now .... Oh no, the cheesy patch of 3 actors and a backdrop done by a child with adobe premiere. This is really the end of my "I've started so I can finish watching it" phase. Oh joy, the credits have come to save me. (and relax)
