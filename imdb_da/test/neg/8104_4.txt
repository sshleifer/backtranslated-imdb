This movie is really an excuse for filmmaking. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the play is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The sound at this time is also horrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as if a jet was going for the whole movie. If these things bother you at all, don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you get past this, you will find that the idea behind the movie is a very good one. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate on several Japanese agents and make them similar to emerging American businessmen who the Japanese have kidnapped and killed. After completing his work, he was betrayed by Japanese and thrown into jail. He later escapes and travels to America to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly publicized murders. It seemed that Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the movie and to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy. The leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned her case was the common, chauvinistic and always correct dominant man found in many films during that time. <br /> <br /> I also found that the camera's work was completely uninspired, and often took exactly the same angles of the same room over and over again. After a while, this tends to pull the movie down and set a very slow pace for "action," which nonetheless does not exist. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is a fascinating one, and with a better writer, director, script, equipment and actor, it can be a great movie. Unfortunately, these handicap movies keep coming back to now and I can't recommend it to anyone but the most open to movie lovers.
