Every time I see Larry King Live, he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests. He rarely gets any useful information because he does not ask the hard questions. This comes from the start of the radio. King established himself on the radio and has basically not changed a bit of the format to television unless his talking head is visible. He becomes like a puppy to his guests, and the only time he really gets useful information from them is who the volunteers do, or a caller to the show is actually asking a hard question. Larry is a nice, paternal type interviewer. That means he shouldn't have a prime time show on a big news network if you're considering CNN one. I'm not doing because of CNN's history. <br /> <br /> Copying (ie cable) New network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news as it could send news 24/7. When it first started, the only television competition was from NBC, ABC, and CBS. Because of this, the CNN copied the format of their competition and achieved respectable ratings. <br /> <br /> This worked fine for CNN until they got competing networks that were innovative and provided better / fresher news coverage. In response to warming up the competition, CNN went into denial and panned its competitors who ate their lunch and ratings because CNN wanted to resist change. This did not work very long and their ratings began to clump. <br /> <br /> Now copying News Network is trying to shape itself by retrieving itself by copying the leading news network format. Unfortunately, this show represents a big piece of the problem. It is 21 years old and shows that age very poorly. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say that King must be moved out of Prime Time or completely wasted.
