Wow. I felt like I had to shower after seeing this one, but maybe there were other reasons why I would leave your imagination. I felt used and mistreated after wacking, I mean watching this movie. Hairy chests, thick mustache and good hairy all describe this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without the hair. <br /> <br /> As a horror-flick this bites. But as an exploitation / porn from Italy's rich film history, it's definitely a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish it had the very badly doubled English, I think it would have added the dizziness factor that already existed. The only white guy put into the movie is "Mark Shannon" - he is the mustache, the hair combed piece of machismo that really tries to give a performance every time he "walks up to the bat". This was at the end of an era where porn producers actually tried to make something artistic. Nothing like panning the camera from a tropical background to a hair man with "dog-style" sex with a woman. I can't help laughing. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I ask my future wife and children never find.
