As a parent of two girls (14 and 11) I have serious doubts about this show and all shows aimed at tweens. Firstly, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny, etc. Always make most houses small and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for housing less than half the size yet on these shows, no one goes or comes from work, payment tools, rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing light bulbs, fixing toilets, etc. . Just going in and out (and down over the ubiquitous, wide stairs found only on TVs) bursting jokes (most involving lying and the fun results) and shirking work. I think children who look at these will have unrealistic expectations of how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Second, there is never an intact family, always a mother or father, but never both, who always go on sexless dates, but never seem to have any of the signs of the signs (alimony, support, arguments). Again, the children can get the impression that if the mother / father gets divorced, it will be fun fun fun (actually mother or father is not around if it helps the plot). Needless to say, there is no mention of spirituality (forget specific religion). Finally, there is a theme that worries me. There are "nerds" that are good in school, "jocks" good in sports, "good two shoes" too. The protagonists are not good at school, sport or charity, but do wisecracks about those who are. The message is not good at anything, just be one of the "nothings" that blends in bursting jokes. Needless to say, I give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time, and I'm just forbidden to ban them in my house.
