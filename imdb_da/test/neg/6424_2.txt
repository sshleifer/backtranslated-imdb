I know a few people who look like the leading actress in this movie (or at least like the character she portrays.) They give me all the creeps and I would be the last person to ever borrow one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. She has a significant and ugly appearance. If you can tell her a little sympathy, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course, if I had an imaginary friend who had killed my real friends and acquaintances over the last 15 years, I can have the same expressions of concern and fear. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends at IMDb, I am sad to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the United States learn courses on paranormal phenomena and rely on the pathetic defense that it represents "academic freedom" and open query. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth your time. You will have no sympathy for any of the characters (except Aunt Lydia, who gets offed quite early) and the plot makes no sense.
