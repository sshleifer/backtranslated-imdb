After reading Fool For Love in a drama class, I was delighted to see how Sam Shepard's wonderful game would be translated into the screen. Much to my dismay, it was not as close as entertaining as the game. The movie seemed to pull, the music was inappropriate for the movie's tone, and all the red energy in the play seemed to have been sucked out of this movie version. It is a shame to see this come out this way, even with Shepard's involvement, which plays Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... see the play the next time it's done in your area or just read the book instead.
