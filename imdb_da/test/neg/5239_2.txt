I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He has played in several good films (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can't even believe he's been playing that movie. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are very bad and the players too. To resume the movie I have only one thing to say: This is the first time I go to watch a movie and will leave after 10 minutes.
