I must say I was surprised to find more positive comments on this turkey (in desperate need of transplantation)! I give it a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about rock'n'roll's wild man - Jerry Lee Lewis is honest, but it's a shame to put such a waste out and "the killer" do not deserve this! That's a good thing, it came late in his career ... they said Elvis nearly ruined his career with the films he set out in the sixties, and it could have done the same for Jerry Lee if it had come 15- 20 years earlier! It is based on Myra Gail Lewis book and it is a shame to begin with. It's a bad and inaccurate story about her life with Lewis, and there are far better books about the killer who could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add in here a lot of actors who do not know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid puts on what should be one of the actors' worst performances in many moon! He walks around the picture and talks about his "god-given talent" and as a spectator he wants him to show something on the screen too! Stupid gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this really horrible movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... scared of Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crazy lines given to her. It's "Grease" again and when Jerry Lee drives around Memphis in his convertible, has the radio in the car, the whole city dances to the music from it! Everyone in this movie is like cartoon characters of the real people involved ... from the wild man to Sun Records Sam Philips! And that's a shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better, and I hope he took the $ 500,000 he got from the deal and told the company to go f ** k himself ... twice!
