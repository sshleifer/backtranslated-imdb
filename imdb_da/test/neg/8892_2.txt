I would watch this movie because I liked "Kavkazsky Plennik" and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov, Jr. and "Spring" with Vladimir Mashkov. Well, unlike the other movies, "The Quickie" was a total waste of time. The story, which makes little sense, very uneven (Lesley Ann Warren was particularly bad), really horrible dialogues, poor filmography, what else could go wrong? I find it fun that in almost every American film produced when the same language-speaking foreigners (Russians in this case) are alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken English (and when they happen to speak Russian, for some reason translators feel obliged to add a lot of "f ** ks" to the sentences that have no profanity, literally or literally. At the same time, native English-language actors choose to speak in broken Russian. Why? When you come back to the story, most of the movie's subplotter (for example, betting the house, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) is nothing reasonable or just confusing viewers. It is too bad that Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) became involved in this disaster.
