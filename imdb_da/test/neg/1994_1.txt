I just saw this smelly old kettle on TV. Best viewed with a very large flagon of Dr. Jurd's Jungle Juice at hand, this incredible cheese feast is hilariously bad. On the (very slender) plus side, Raquel was in her physical prime, she looks good and you see a fair share of her playing a go-go dancer; She had big legs, that's for sure. There is also some less interest in screen buffs in the footage of Los Angeles approx. '69, and in spotting actors in smaller parts that went on to better things. Veteran Thesp Ron Rifkin ('Brothers and Sisters') provides early performances like the "Sailor" bartender "fagot junkie", which ranks Raquel to the bad guy. You can also recognize the weapon-preserving security guard in the hit-and-run scene - it's a very early appearance of Gordon Jump, which gave such a lovely performance in 'Soap' as a piece of chelief tinker. <br /> <br >> 'Flareup' 'plot' as it follows, follows an exotic dancer (Welch) busy from his murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic production line Hollywood slam - a coloring, pedestrian, hokey shot, edits and effects template, ultra-cheesy stock, plywood sets, and matching matches. <br /> <br /> The cast is just as horrible as the manuscript. Although Raquel is capable of fair performances in the right vehicle, this hilarious old clunker is so bad that she doesn't really stand a chance, nor the audience. One of my favorite moments arises when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees the Vegas policeman pursuing his murderous ex, and asks "How did you get here?" - of course he responds "in a plane." Oh mankind ... And you won't be able to take the eyes of the doctor (Michael Rougas) who has what might be one of the very worst walk-ons in the long sad story with bad cameos. I don't think I've ever seen anyone in a place so bad before. <br /> <br /> Raquel's love interest Joe (James Stacy) ambles through the movie with a fixed look somewhere between confused and embarrassed - and no wonder. This bomb throws away almost all the television clich√©s in the book, from Raquel's spectacular terrible trip in the terrible nightmare mount to the sheer rhythm of the romantic horse-drawn carriage along Leo Carillo Beach. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** - Just the only thing interesting in the whole movie is the denouement, where Raquel finally gets his own back and hilariously creates the title by burning baddie. The one that the stunt chamber had really earned his money on one - he goes up like Yorba Linda in a heat wave. Nevertheless, this rather spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew moves into the shot at the end. There are so many crazy things about 'Flareup' that it is strangely convincing; I found myself wondering if it could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The answer seemed to be a resounding "Yes" ... until I saw the movie that followed it, Roger Corman's most classic "caged heat" classic "The Big Doll House", which takes Awful to a whole new level. I highly recommend these two shlockers as a double bill. You will laugh yourself silly.
