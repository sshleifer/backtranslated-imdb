I have seen many bad movies in my life. Date movie. That was bad. But this ... this is just ... it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It's as simple as that. It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people in it. Oh, and it's not fun. It's terrible. So terrible. Chris Stokes can be a superstar at BET, but he's an idiot. He can't write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to refer to him as a harder, lesser-known Uwe Boll. Except Uwe Boll's movies are fun terrible if you know what I mean. You can invite some friends, pop in Alone In The Dark, and have a good time laughing and eating snacks with your friends. Chris Stokes is such, except if you invite friends to see House Party 4 with you, no one will laugh. Not even the preset token-black guy or the illiterate. I'm serious, I didn't even laugh all over this movie. The play is terrible and the movie looks like a bad movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 Cursed Dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie just sucks; Don't waste your time with this crap. It's disgusting.
