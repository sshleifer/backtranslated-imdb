Probably a movie about a magazine that sends journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one that is more or less tolerant or agnostic throughout the case and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic laughing at UFO nonsense. It's all a crock, a kind of money that makes the racket. It turns out that this film is actually a fraud, and a trap to actually promote Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs I have heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation, which in itself is not biblical, but invented by some modern theologians who can fit everything in their mythology. The paranormal? It is real, just demonic, unless it is done in a Christian context, so of course it is of God. Simple, if it is not of God, it is the devil's stupid! So I assume that when Beethoven's 9th symphony was not inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or the logic would lead to absurdity. We are informed that since the Bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe, there is no one (a version of Ad Ignorantium error) and that God created the universe so great, so great to show us its almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan's remark that if God created such a great universe and stuck life alone on earth, it would have been a great waste of space. So what are UFOs? They are Demonic activity and care about soon to be earthshaking Christian event, the break ... I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, the true Christians disappear from the surface of the earth and masses cause mass panic, confusion, car and airplane crashes ... whatever. Therefore, Satan knows this by sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction that can then be used to explain away this otherwise unexplained event. All parts of Satan's plan, of course, will keep people from looking to God or Jesus and falling to Antichrist's lies. This ad hoc explanation also indicates theological mishmash by explaining a mystery to another, as opposed to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the peculiar and the mysterious in as much as possible to the known, if not exclusively, known one. <br /> <br /> It is like jumping directly to a foreign abduction when a child is missing and unjustified. I think I will first look at more earthly explanations as if the child has gone away, lost or been kidnapped for ransom, or abducted by a predator of predators before invoking foreigners, or the supernatural or Satan or any such. <br /> <This kind of fraud or trap on the part of the fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to Free Rock Concerts, which can start with something innocent, then suddenly switch to open Christian music followed by a sermon and an altar call . This kind of blatant deception may be more Satan's ball game. But perhaps because the Christian faith will soon be in its destiny, these guys feel that everything goes, any deception or nap or scary tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, facing serious opposition from both secularists and competing Faiths such as Islam, the world's fastest growing religion, which may well replace Christianity, as Islam is far more coherent and united and logically more durable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this should give little man a small advantage, it would replace an intolerant thought system with another. And of course, the film ends more or less with a variation of Pascal's bet. The atheistic Aussie, who is skeptical of almost everything, is told. Well, if you are right that there is no life after death, it is nothing but tearing, no worries ... but what if you got it wrong? <br /> <br /> In fact, statements that involve reality adapting to nothing but an atheistic point of view or Christian imagination are a false dilemma or black and white error. Although the atheists are wrong, it would not necessarily correct Christianity by default, or if Christianity turns out to be full of gaps in its theology, the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default. <br /> <br /> For all we know, Indian spirituality can prove to be the best description of the ultimate reality, and we may need to have treated the Earth and its creatures a little better. <br /> <br /> This movie should be stamped properly on the box: Caution: Contains religious propaganda and is not intended for informative or entertainment purposes.
