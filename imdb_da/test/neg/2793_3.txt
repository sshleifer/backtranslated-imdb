Okay, I'm sorry the cast and crew of this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've seen yet ... First, the play was okay. It could have been better (especially in some parts), but it was "okay". Then there was the cheapest video camera (as they used). The violence was pretty good. If it was pace faster, it would be great, but they didn't (* sigh *) ... Scares. The scares were well written (in the script) but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the attic is a girl halfway in it, and the other half is in the dark, lower area of ​​the stables house, then she gets it. The monster grabs her down, and then you hear something that gets emptied. The scares could have been better if the music was not ripped from a cheap horror sound CD. The blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like "Kill Bill". K. B. pulled it off because it was supposed to look like old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink .... it's sad. The ripped bodies in the movie were good, but scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store. Don't let the deck fool you, costumes suck! My overall grade is a 3/10. If you are interested in independent movies, you are easily satisfied, or just 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, going to Blockbuster and seeing the fate of failure.
