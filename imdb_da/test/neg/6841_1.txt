Get up! Get up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent play? Unnecessary! Respect shown to his mighty ancestor? Unnecessary! Yes there is another offensive turkey in the Butch Bruce canon. <br /> <br /> I mean, where do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the miserable misconception people might have somehow related to either the book or the original movie, Jackalys Day. It is not. In fact, it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to get his name taken off of it. Now I'm not necessarily a dotted Brit who can't hack Hollywood remake British movies. Well, okay, maybe I'm a little like that, but fortunately this is a superfluous point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive. Now we have to move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangsters are killed in a police attack in Moscow (somehow involving the FBI, although no one has difficulty explaining why). In revenge, the brother of gangster decides to avenge her by killing the US President's wife (although again it is not someone who has difficulty explaining why this is a good step, even if it made sense before it was 9-11, Then he didn't know that it would have resulted in the US Air Force blanket bombing Eastern Europe). Gangster hires "ugly" killer (Willis). Police hire "seedy" killer (Gere), "seedy" killer track "ugly" killer. Police are found and are regularly killed. "Killer" killer kills "ugly" killer. The first lady is rescued, and we all realize that the IRA is just this bunch of real sweet guys who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice. On the one hand, let's put the hilarious Hollywood habit of playing in Northern Ireland's problems as if it were a sandbox in an amusement park (I'm dealing with this point more broadly on the message cards). If Hollywood directors want to throw Belfast butchers as hookers with gold hearts, it's up to them. Of course, I reserve the right to despise them. It is a free country. But more egregious is that the film manages to fight and offend the Irish while trying to support them. It is not politically scary, it is far worse: it is incompetent. It is no wonder that Gere still looks good as he slept through the six months it took to do this piece of cra * p. The fact that Geres accent is not just Southern Irish but a scary Parody of the Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers do not have much to do with America to make money from this movie. Then there is the lovely scene at the end, where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this movie) says he's out for a coffee, offers to get our "nice" IRA man one by one so randomly says "Ah, But then guys drink guinness you don't ". Yes it is right Sidney; Irish living on guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> while we are the subject of poitier: why? In the original film, the detective is the tram. In Jackal is Gere Tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, he's just hanging around and of course looks like a twin. He has absolutely nothing to do except calling the marines at the end, and he only does it because the good IRA man tells him. <br /> <br /> While we are the subject of Gere: why? I assume it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel plays the ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi, who steers his way through the 1940s and 50s India (he's a little dark hue and therefore very likely to be Muslim fundamentalist). Let us not forget that Geres character is a murderer and therefore an unpleasant job. And if he isn't, why does he know The Jackal? If he is not, why does he know all his movements? And if he is, why is he such a bit of biscuit and such a "lovable" person? <br /> <br /> All this shows that the filmmakers in this movie couldn't be disturbed (a) thinking of the plot (b) getting the characters to make decisions that were in keeping with their character (c) avoiding cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend ?? I honestly thought this had become a Bond movie (d) giving the "central" characters something to do (s) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the British and Irish killed in the hands of terrorists, it is an insult to the Irish people, it is an insult to not big but pretty good movie it rips off and a insult to intelligence. But most of all ?? and most unforgivable ?? It is an insult to my journey to have to sit for the two-hour period it took to finish. Honestly, you would think without a plot, no sign and no dialogue, it would be over in no time. But they didn't even have a decency to finish early.
