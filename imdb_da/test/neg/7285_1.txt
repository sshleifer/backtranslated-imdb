I'm sorry to say this, but I didn't like this movie. It was just too boring. So boring that I couldn't see the rest of it. It's not as interesting as Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate these stupid days, because these days it's just not what they used to be. The movies that Disney has released in the past really suck! I miss the old days when they used to produce great movies like Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to be interested in this movie, but I just couldn't. I don't think I could recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend those I just mentioned above.
