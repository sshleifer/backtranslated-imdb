If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror. This is the most pretentious movie that is made all over the world I am convinced. A son, without a name, takes care of his mother without a name. They love each other, I think. No, they don't, I'm sure. These are not signs. They are not even actors playing characters. At least it can be beautiful, but even nature seems ridiculously affected and changed where it was necessary with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov come up with a technique like hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration? You should be born yesterday to buy this waste. 10.1.
