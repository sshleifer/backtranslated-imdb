It was stupid. Kind of like an Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were some fun parts but not so funny. I liked some of the actors in it myself. <br /> <br /> There were some sat. Night Live people in the movie. But I would not recommend this unless there is nothing else better. And it was still better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
