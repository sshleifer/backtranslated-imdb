I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B movie if it has some sort of redeeming value for it, but Dead Space has nothing to redeem it! This is the kind of movie that will make you frustrated, restless and sick in your stomach. <br /> <br /> Bad play. Lame story. Terrible effects. Terrible, eerie dialogue. Dead Space Has It All!
