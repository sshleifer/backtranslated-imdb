Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (Twisted Sister), Amal Rhoe. Disturbing scenes of torture 'highlight' this dark, obnoxious film about a sadistic psychopath that entices teens into its torture chamber via the Internet. Snider (from 80-year-old rock band Twisted Sister) plays the rugged psychopath, which is a nasty "twist" (no pun intended) on Hannibal Lecter. Pena is wasted as one of the victims' mothers. Harrelson (Brother of Woody) delivers one of the worst cop performances I've ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe proves why this is her only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is ultimately numbing, torture scenes very graphic and gross, and the end just sucks. RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated for graphical violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
