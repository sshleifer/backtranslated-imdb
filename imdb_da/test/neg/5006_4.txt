It is very sad to see any of the calibers of George C Scott in a low budget thriller that would have been better if the original novel was written by Graham Greene and directed by someone more experienced in the genre. DO NOT REVIEW A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. There are so many missing options with scenery and carnival just glossed over, rather than trapped to find the movie solid in the novel's exotic setting. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in viewers comments on this site, a very astute observer complained about the many in-depth bad accents in this movie. Ever since I saw George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I have asked him to never accept a role that required him to take over a British accent. Just now and then he could just pass for British or a very British-sounding South African, apparently played by an American actor. I can belly Meryl Streep's extraordinarily worked accents (both British and Australian) - at least she gets it right, even though by any pronunciation she requires us to marvel at her skills. Well, I'm sorry that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and it just destroys the illusion - like having Michele Yeoh speak spooky Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger, etc. <br /> <br /> Peterson doesn't look different from what we see on CSI. Except that he is still very nice and more or less slim in this movie. He's Harrison Ford of TV. Same old expression of any feeling, every situation. No by other thinking, Ford has two - confused / painful and happy. I've never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
