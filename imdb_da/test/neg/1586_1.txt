I caught this at Cinemax very late at night ... nothing else was on so I had virtually no choice. Bottom line, horrible reason, slow, waste of good movie and the actors' time. To make it short, don't even bother with this. It's wrong we can't give zero as a rating; this one is really not worth even considering !!!
