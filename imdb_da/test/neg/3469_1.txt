I can't understand how this picture was allowed. It is mostly, if not completely, inaccurate so much that the protagonist does not even look like the story has him physically looking. This movie made me go on the internet and review my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book that lists Nero as one of the world's most vicious people, and the movie made me feel bad for him. I must say that Aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. Although the actors all did a good job, the movie was horrible and I am sure I will not see anyone else made by this apologetic team.
