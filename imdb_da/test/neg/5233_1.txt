To read the book I once again felt drawn into Castle Rock (Necessary was the last part of the Rock Trilogy), and the plot was a variation on the "demon coming to the little redneck village" type story King likes to tell. The characters were all described in loving detail, which made both a good psychological and gory horror. The film, on the other hand, is horrible. Gone are the character interactions and the wise plot and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses a mile. If you haven't read the book, then you like it, otherwise it is avoided at all costs, as with most movies in King's books.
