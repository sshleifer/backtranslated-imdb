Stanley Kubrick, an instructor whom I value most for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.) took the film out of circulation and left it only by hardcore fans and compliments. After watching the movie for myself I could see why. By the age of 24, Kubrick had already made his craft of still photography for LOOK magazine and had made some short documentaries. Like many top filmmakers who came for decades after him, his ambition of fear and desire was, in short, to go and make a movie cheap, more than likely to see if he could. At that level, he was successful. However, the film is of course not. <br /> <br /> I can't really say the movie is a mistake because there was something I liked about it all. Even when the story of the movie went on the road, and the actors (like Kubrick had no idea how to lead, not being a theater man), his ability to produce and capture some good pictures gets his seeds in this movie. At times, there are some shots of close-ups and quick shots in excitement / action scenes that are eye-catching. Unfortunately, it's all the good I can really say about the movie. Although there are a few 'name' actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances are generally poor and very routine. <br /> In fact, it's the movie's greatest death for me; When I see any Kubrick movie, even his early movie Noir's Killer's Kiss and the Kill, I can tell who did it when his style became apparent, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. It wasn't as artificial as I could have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but it wasn't just Kubrick watching this movie, but it felt like a lot of the time I saw some B (or even C) grade film by a director that time forgot - not quite 'Ed Wood' bad, but close. The music is as standard as it can be, fades are pedestrian, and the plot does not seem to be so attentive. <br /> In short, as others have said, and as I can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future ground-breaker that shows some shots and a few edits that take one some attention (the best scene is at all when the soldiers take the stupid girl hostage) but not enough to really recommend except those like myself who end up seeing everything of Kubrick (or maybe have to see any ultra -Low budget war film ever made) if it is only of curiosity.
