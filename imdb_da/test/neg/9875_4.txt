When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it was not long before DVDs from the old Incredible Hulk TV show appeared in an attempt to slip into craze. We saw a similar event a year earlier when Spider-Man comics appeared on DVD to coincide with the hero's big screen debut. Companies are jumping into the opportunity to run on the economic brand of a hot brand. <br /> <br /> So the fact that this picture never passed on Wal-Mart's shelves as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I think everyone involved would just forget. To be fair, the AMAZING FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase it. It is not as endearing as any of its negative reviews can suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you can't remember any of his roles) leads the way as Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist who, along with his crew, gets bizarre powers after a external room accident. He is back with the ability to stretch and disturb his body to monstrous lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly become invisible, while her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can now turn himself on. Then there are poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the gracious bow whose body rips into a lot of crooked, orange rock. As friends get used to all this, they are called to save the world from certain chaos. It seems that Reed's old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) lives up to his name, and the evil jewels (Ian Trigger) also do not help the old ladies across the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; Like any superhero movie, it's just a matter of how and when. What is striking about the FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. The dialogue is so boring and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. The actor is so unpolished, it makes a third rate afternoon soap opera similar to Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the small budget, but there are still some positive embarrassing moments. When Human Torch fully ignites its body, the entire movie becomes a comic book. I can only hear the production meeting. "Oh, no one will notice. They are too fascinated by the action!" I really mean a cartoon? At least give me a mannequin for a fire! Prior to that, the scene in which the foursome comes to earth on earth after their spaceship crashes, clean toes-in-the-back ticket price. The crew simply found a field and lit a vaginal spaceship-like object on fire. That is the only remnant of such a great disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course, there wasn't much to do with the script. There is a fairly coherent story here, but it is so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into outer space, they simply drop by Storm's house and ask if they will take care of them. Is it really that easy? Don't this kind of thing, oh, I don't know, years of training and expertise? Not in the authors' world, which seemed to be inspired by the undervalued genius on the display of FULL HOUSE reruns. But just as bad as it can be, nothing can be compared to how painfully clich√©d Dr. Doom is. He was pulled straight out of the horrible superhero cartoons of the 1960s, right down to the evil laughter and slammed his clenched fist onto the table to break his remarks. No cartoon, at least of all Fantastic Four, has ever shown a villain so indecently one-dimensional. In the end, the FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because it is just so innocent innocent. You can really tell the people involved, as a little talent or experience they had, that they were trying. They did not know that the final result would be so embarrassing. They were under the impression that this was their big break, that people would flock to the theaters. It repeats that they almost didn't have the money to work with (and I'm sure half were eaten by the cool Thing costume). All things considered, they did well, and for their many mistakes, the finished product is a great pleasure for the cartoon fan.
