This movie has some flaws, and most of these errors are lacking in something that happens. Possibly the biggest movie showing the dirt in Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie where nothing happens and you don't care about anyone. Just as life begins, it moves, and then it ends. A couple of attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could waste their lives, do something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at each instance. Do yourself a favor and watch a good movie. This is free and repeatedly often on Comedy Central because no one went to see it, no one will see it and it is marginally better than dead air. Not to despair with weak praise, but the movie's one rock song is worth listening to. Too bad the movie is not worth seeing.
