The '80s were the best times and worst times for James Karin, he was in one of the best cult fear chamber with "Return of the Living Dead" and a year later he appeared in this piece .... this bad movie. A sequel to Hardbodies (but not really), has a group of rather unlikely characters trying to make a movie in Greece. Through design or pure laziness, the line between the film and the "movie in a movie" is not only blurred, but virtually non-existent from stage to scene (which would be confusing if I was just interested in something happening in the film in Ufunny will be too generous a concept .Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio, and many many extras become topless; Brenda Bakke shows something T & A <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extra : Only trailers for "Hardbodies", "American High School", "Strike", "Virgin Territory" (coming in a DVD movie with the first movie for masochistic)
