Bad plays? Yes, but it was not a surprise. Stupid story? Yes, so what? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Mr President, why all this slow motion crap? Fighting scenes were bad, really bad, due to slow motion and poor cutting. Not because Seagal. <br /> <br /> "What if I just accelerate it for 2 seconds and then lower the next 5 seconds and then ... Maybe I'll turn the coin to decide?" What did you think, Mr. Director ???
