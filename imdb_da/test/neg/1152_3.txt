I had never heard of this movie before it came to DVD. I was immediately fascinated by everything: the actors, the title, the cover, and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you can't go wrong with him, can you? Yep. I haven't read the novel, but I guess it was much better than the movie. I had great hopes for this movie. I love Macy and Dern, and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this movie never rises over cookie cutter notices of racism and bigotry. If you've never seen other movies dealing with this topic or if you never knew America was founded on bigotry, then maybe this movie will wow you. Others will probably find it predictable, outdated and totally boring.
