It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal has really been playing horrible movies after horrible movies. Every time every movie gets worse and worse, it's really great! I don't really know what to say about TIME, first it's a piece of shit, the story doesn't make any sense at all, secondly he uses stuntmen in all his fighting scenes, and last but not least, many recordings are taken from other movies! It amazes how this guy continues to find work, he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that, his movie is full of plot holes and stunt men. Why do we continue to buy his movie, why do we continue to hope that maybe he will make a good movie?
