I got a kick out of Reynolds and told his lawyer, "Look, I've made a lot of shi% for things in my life, but I've never killed anyone."

Physical Evidence was originally supposed to be a successor to 'The Jagged Edge', which Glen Close sankt rejected. The verdict is inside, avoiding physical documentation.
