Again we get a melange of themes that are well covered by so many previous films. The good and bad son history, courtesy East of Eden. The American naval hero story, which does not consider itself to be one because of what he knows. And the grieving wife who may fall in love with another person's story. Only the stories that are so ubiquitous are not so much of a problem. Because they could theoretically still be better presented and treated every time. Not fortunate this time, as all three of these threads eventually fall flat all together. Since the bad son never really gets to talk to his father, the conflict is never solved correctly. Apart from the father's kind, appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovation of the grieving wife's kitchen. Now, how satisfying is that. <br /> <br /> Next, the surprising homecoming marine that suspects its wife of infidelity conflict is never solved. Because he never really speaks to the man under suspicion, his own brother. So once again we have come a loose end here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the US military hero hypocrisy theme, where the sea is publicly regarded as a hero, as he went through the turmoil of war, he should not really be called one with his own standards, the third theme falls flat just the same. Because the movie ends right when he can only talk to his wife about what he went through for the first time. Where the real story would actually begin at the very point, namely, his recovery process, how it would look, and how he would finally meet the family, he would have a certain amount of guilt to admit. All that all the really interesting pieces are passed and ignored. <br /> <br /> So while the story is this movie is a serious one, and I mean serious disappointment, I still want to give that point to the impressive cast. Although no movie should use Maguire for a voice over because it belongs to Spiderman. Especially an adult Gyllenhaal seems to meet all the expectations he awakened as a young and hopeful actor. So much so that I would actually love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding role with the correct profile. <br /> <br /> So while throwing really seems to do what they can, I consider this movie completely forgettable otherwise. In fact, a superficial and ultimately pretentious, totally unsatisfactory tear press. Message du jour to the authors: we already know the wounds, see the host of Vietnam movies. You want to make some credit, show us a credible cure.
