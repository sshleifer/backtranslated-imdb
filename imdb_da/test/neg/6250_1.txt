Before I begin, I need to inform you that I love horror movies with a passion. LOVE THEM! I have seen thousands, and rarely do you come together that I don't like. I am very forgiving for the horror genre. One of the greatest lines in film history is in the movie "Ed Wood" where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) freaks out and shouts for the overly critical producers after commenting on "Plan 9's" cheap set and continuity issues: "You don Don't know anything! Have you never ever heard of 'suspension of unbelief?' "Well, I'm trying to bring this" suspension of disbelief "philosophy with me to any horror movie I see and it works normally. Unfortunately, it did not work for me during the screening of Cheerleader Massacre. <br /> <br /> Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice about this "movie" is that it is shot in video and has the curved handheld home digital camera style. The camera's work and quality are so bad that it makes the daylight so breathtaking in comparison. In fact, it makes Troma and Full Moon publications look good. And that's bad. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski. This "filmmaker" still feels a chip out of ol 'Corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. Roger Corman shot fast, furious and under budget, but could deliver a tight original movie. Although Wynorski delivers a cheap movie, he cheats his viewers (and perhaps other artists) as he steals whole pieces of James Horner's "Humanoid's From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" musical scores and unfortunately loses them to Cheerleader Massacre. At the back of the visual arts and initially the music is credited with the score false to Dan Savio (an extra in Wynorski's "Deathstalker II"). You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to movie and back again when Wynorski lifts the whole scene from both "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From The Deep." Wynorski took advantage of this fraud fourteen years earlier in his terrible version of "Not of this Earth". Strike Three (you're out): <br /> <br /> While Cheerleader Massacre does have some nudity (40-year-olds play teens and the largest number of fake breasts I've ever seen in a horror movie, ugh), the murders are relatively bloodless. What is tobogganing about? The movie is titled, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen killings, in my opinion, doesn't add up to a massacre. It doesn't even add a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is fair enough - invisible killer steals a burdened cheerleaders (old gals play teens) until the habit runs out of gas and the "girls" are forced to stay in secluded two-story mountain homes . I don't want to ruin the end for you, but it's one of those "movies" where the person who is, of course, the killer is not obviously the killer. Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it was shot on film, directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. Instead, it is an efficient, shot-on-video travesty by Jim Wynorski. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I ask for you, please buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, the more of this talented video waste they will produce. Go out and rent "The Prowler", "The Last House on Dead End Street", "Delirium" or "The Burning" instead. You will be glad you did.
