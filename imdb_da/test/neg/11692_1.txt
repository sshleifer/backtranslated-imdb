Oh how terrible is this movie! I don't know if it's a horror movie or a drama because the story and both genres aren't very well established! History does not move, it is slow, dull and sleepy from the beginning to the end. This movie really drills me! But I really liked the camera's work, it's authentic, fresh and clear, the play is also good, the little boy was the big performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me jump from my seat. But this movie makes me take a pillow, put on the bed and sleep until the credits roll ... Drilling! Not worth seeing! I tell you this movie sucked! <br /> <br /> 1/10
