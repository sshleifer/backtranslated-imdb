ALERT: This review contains large SPOILERS. If you plan to watch this movie, please do not read on. <br /> <br /> Judging from the number of votes it got (my vote was the fifth). Very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An entire women's association called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a big league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names of the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people LPWA had in rudeness and ability. Unfortunately, LPWA closed in the early 90s, so it seemed only natural for someone with so much talent like Mimi to start a acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to things like this? This movie is really bad. As it went along, I was holding an undervalued movie called `Survivor Quest '. Only this movie lacks everything that made 'Survivor Quest' fun. <br /> <br /> When I started the tape, I went fast forward through preview to get to the flesh of the tape. At first I wasn't very attentive, but then I realized that the previve was for a movie starring Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought, "here is another movie with Mimi looking for." But as the example was turned on, I became aware that there was a preview for ??. "Beyond Fear!" You know you're in trouble when the only example at the beginning contains the movie you're watching! The reason for this is quite standard. Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer who lives with the blame to hurt an opponent / friend so she focuses on her second career, which she shares with her friend Sammy: being a desert guide. On this special occasion she gets a group of three couples. Two of the couples are right there to take a seat. You think a couple, a Caucasian man and a Korean wife will be explored as a problem arises between them halfway through the movie, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about the bears in the forest, which consistently scares the Korean wife . The wit is fun the first time you hear it, but it's certainly not the ninth time they do it. The third couple is just painful to see: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They act insults back and forth, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for voyeurism's art when he is not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wife? Like your typical American couple! Before the trip Mr. Page on two stupid guys and their prostitutes. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out that Mr. Page lost it. Then the father begins when the two guys track the group on their turn and we wait. And wait .... and wait .... and wait for them to finally do something. When they do, it's a failure. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the cast. They try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with. The lead role is director Robert F. Lyons, who has to go back to playing bit pieces and stay out of the chair of the manager. Lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy, sudden case that you begin to think he's suffering from dyspepsia throughout the shot. There is even an incompetent moment when a wide daylight scene with the girls slides between some night scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and background noise override the dialog completely so you have to move your ear right next to the television's speaker. Don't dust your head on the screen! It is not worth hearing the badly written lines. Talking about bad writing, Lesseos gets some of the credit there as co-author. The few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned by shots from the actors or bad practical jokes. In the beginning, Lesseos knocks out with a knife with a knife, so you don't even think they are in danger of the two stupid thugs. When the villains finally get their rear ends made of Lesseos in a well-written and long struggle, our casts all have a big laugh together, despite one of them being shot and bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. Everyone except the poor souls witnessed the movie, which wanted the good old days of glory when Mimi performed in the breaking ring. Zantara's score: 4 out of 10
