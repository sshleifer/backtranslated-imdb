Oh God! This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's incredibly repetitive; each scene seems to consist of people being shot down, running around and screaming or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I didn't mind if the fight was even good, but it's not; The protagonist Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he is in full view of Tracker, he is never hit, even though extras and minor characters are shot and blown around him. I have rarely seen a worse actor actor (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him an "actor"), but it's not really surprising considering the dialogue they need to work with (test line: "Computers killed my brother ! "). The reason is a sub-par ripoff of the excellent Terminator; The special effects are ridiculous. Overall, this movie is just horrible. And why does everything explode?
