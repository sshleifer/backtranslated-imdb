Skeletons in Closet take the father-teenage singing to new levels of low. This is a movie that does not serve any purpose. The reason is laid out in the first few minutes, there is no excitement, the characters are clich√© and despite plot twists trying to confuse and confuse, everything plays out exactly as you think it will. Halfway through the film, I could no longer keep the snail's pace and started fast forward. The movie ended exactly as expected. Linda Hamilton is fantastic as always, and the other actors are above average considering there is a complete lack of direction. If you really think you should see this uninspired lukewarm wannabe whodunit, look it up quickly.
