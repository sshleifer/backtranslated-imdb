Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst movie I've seen all year and I've run over some doozies. There is nothing redeeming about this trash from the characterization to the direction of the plot. Even the normally brilliant Dominique Swain couldn't save this movie. None of the signs are at least sympathetic, with the possible exception of Eloise (wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this gloomy failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that it ramps without saying anything. It stagnates about drunk instead of leading us along the path of history. It also introduces numerous potentially tantalum details (the hypochondriac, the mother's possessions are constantly resumed, the anti-Semitic classmate, the other classmate's murderous father) unsuccessfully exploring one of them. And just as I finally thought there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie goes down in an unexpectedly violent end. <br /> <br /> I left the movie, feeling that it was trying to tell me something but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be conveyed. This is an obvious first film from a writer / instructor who really needs more time working under more established filmmakers before continuing to do more of her work on an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10 and I'm usually very generous, even with bad movies.
