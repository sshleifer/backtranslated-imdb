Well, if you set aside the fact that this movie has an eerie action; and if you set aside the fact that history is muddled and wandering in about five different directions without having to decide which way to go; and if you set aside the fact that I didn't find a single scene in this movie that was extremely interesting; Well, if you set aside all that, it's still a really horrible movie! <br /> <br /> I think this should be a love story about rich guy / poor girl. I never understood for a moment how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) was ever started. The inexplicable romance gets worse with a complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The manuscript (by Michael Seitzman) is boring to the stupefying point. How Seitzman managed to write the case without falling asleep is a miracle; That he would think someone would like to pay to see this is incredible. <br /> <br /> Did I mention this is a really, really horrible movie? <br /> <br /> I would give it a ZERO but IMDb doesn't give votes for NULL. So I give it one while I hold my nose.
