I couldn't. I was bored not only because the play was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was about cannibalism, but the fact that I saw a subtitle foreign movie that didn't bother me, but still became dubbed. <br /> <br /> "Special effects" were terrible. As the back of the plane separates, you can see that the model is hollow as it "breaks away" into the false snow. Most of the film is at a sound stage that is clearly not right and almost resembles a game, as "sounds" of snow blowing over the whole hearing but not actually the scene. "But what do they want to eat? They have no food" a military person (it is never clear what this guy does or why he is responsible) says, as I am sure no one has ever said in reality or even thought of food when they were worried if the people lived, not how they would eat. It was simply a stupid line written to point out that yes, they must eat the dead bodies to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the organs, a man finds a shirtless body, who despite being in the snow for too long, is not far frozen, in fact his flesh is very flexible and fresh. He cuts the fresh meat out of his back, it is again not frozen or even cold, it looks, and this scene continues for five minutes. It was here that I had to stop. Remake "Alive" was a much better movie about trying to survive in a terrible situation that I'm sure the real survivors praised while I can't imagine any of them having anything good to say about this version. It was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
