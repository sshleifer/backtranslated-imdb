This is really bad, the characters were boring, the story was dull and there is no sex scene. In addition, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal, making it extremely slow paced. Nothing happens in this movie, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. The plot is about three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger, whom they pick from the highway. The couple invite the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this point, would you expect the stranger to have sex with his wife right? No, they just kiss and that's it. Also this movie contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even excitement. Make it that the studio might not even read this script !!!!
