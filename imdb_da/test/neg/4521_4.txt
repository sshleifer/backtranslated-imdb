There is the excitement of low budget film noir. And there is frustration with wobbly, uninteresting movies made on the cheap. This falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a policeman whose father has been killed by gangsters. He heads out to track them down. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the bad print. Maybe it's me. But I felt that I had seen this one hundred times, most of these times better than here. <br /> <br /> It's also allowed: Copen is fascinated by a woman who plays records she introduces over juke boxes. They then meet. Now, even though this was done well before I was born, I've seen that kind of jukebox. And it's incredibly fascinating: When I was a teenager, I walked into a bar that still had such a unit. I always wanted jukeboxes, bars or eateries. But this one was different. You talked to it, and a sweet-hearted female voice spoke back to you! It is directed here, but fell into the general, unattractive stowage. <br /> <br /> The movie has one thing that goes for it: In a small role, the very young Anne Jeffreys. What beauty she was, and that is no doubt yet!
