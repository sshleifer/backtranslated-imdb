I'm afraid I only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie, as it really seemed to me to be thoughtless television waste and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give that part a real kick. As she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime, it is hard to feel any real concern about any of the characters. Even John Goodman delivers his weak comics with a lack of panache, as if the white humor is to be recited slowly if someone misses the joke. The end must be good, but the starter and the main course left me without appetite to find out.
