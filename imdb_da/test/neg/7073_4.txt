Teenage Tamara (Jenna Dewan) is rough. She is ridiculed by all the popular "kids" for being shy, bookish, frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft. All soccer players and cheerleaders are particularly angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse to the school book. In addition, her father is drunk, her mother is not around, and she is secretly in love with her supportive English teacher (Matthew Marsden). The popular kids create a cruel prank to humble her, accidentally kill her during a fight, bury the body in the forest and make a covenant to keep silent. For their shock, Tamara goes back into the classroom the next day and looks seductively and dressed to kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for supernatural vengeance on everyone involved. She also takes time to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and try to seduce her English teacher away from her wife (Claudette Mink), a school counselor. <br /> <br /> Action and writing are strictly mediocre. You can also tell the people in charge of this movie such as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996) because it borrows wholesale from all three of these superior films. There is something going on (a guy cuts off his ear and tongue and then his eyes are probably the best bit), an unpleasant vomiting scene and a couple of campy / witty one-liners. Not a horrible movie in any way, but not much originality went into it.
