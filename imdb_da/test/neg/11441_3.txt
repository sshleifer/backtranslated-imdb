Not as bad as the 1992 "Nails" (where Hopper plays an "unstable" policeman), but pretty bad. How can a movie with such a big cast go so wrong? This movie manages to find a way. The story was pretty stupid, and Hopper's direction seemed like he had never done before. All the long shots at the start were bothersome. Lots of pointless scenes with a lot of pointless dialogue.
