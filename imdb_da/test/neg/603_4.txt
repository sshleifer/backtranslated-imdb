I found this movie to be mostly a POSit was low budget, but that's not the problem. The problem is that the movie is just lame. It doesn't make much sense. Well, that explains why things happened, but that's not what I mean. It was just no reason for it all. The film also moved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than this. Also, I think they went overboard a little in the killers. I don't think they were too brutal, but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over his head or stabbing his victim. maybe I'm petty, but I just didn't like the movie. It all seemed like a lower rate version of "When a Stranger Calls" and maybe it was all point.but so what. For me "When A Stranger Kills" is a 4/10 *
