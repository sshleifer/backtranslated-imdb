I am a German student so sorry for finally mistakes (I work on it;)) The stylistically very interestingly converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama is in no way deflected from terrible bad actors (non-stop and unnatural movements and expressions of emotions ) and makes the relatively quick and meaningless story less better. Just the typical slasher genre with in this case very strange action. Many city players partially destroy the main story and let the viewers come to the end of the darkness, create wonder and convince the senses of action and the point is more dangerous. It's probably a hit for slasher fans, but not for me. But even though the interesting style of filmography and skillful use of light has proved to be good. <br /> <br /> So not the best ...
