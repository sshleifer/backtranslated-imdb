This was of course the worst movie ever made ... ketchup was the lead in this movie and would be the only nominee for a prize. Because the plot, the actors and all that was related to this farce, were horrible and ridiculous. I could have made a better horror flick in my backyard within two hours with a handheld camera using grass-filled dummies like the actors, at least the actor would have been better! Don't waste your time or money on this one ... it is extremely cheesy and awful !!
