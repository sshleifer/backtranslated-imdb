This 1950's howler is so bad it's accidentally fun. Tom Conway portrays Dr. Gerard, a scientist who turns native into a monster using voodoo. His poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is held captive by her wacko hubby who does not have time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. At the same time, Marla comes English as a greedy killer who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. Her idiot girlfriend, depicted by Lance Fuller, is on a safari. They employ "Touch" Connors (later renamed Mike Connors, Mannix Fame) as a guide. English is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast also turned to academic award-winning performances. "Touch" (I'm sorry, I can't even write the name without looking up, I mean, what ...) gave the only half way decent performance of the pile, and that says a lot. The monster is only seen briefly, and the end is predictable to say the least. I would say that this movie falls into "it's so bad it's almost good" category of movies. It's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the pipe.
