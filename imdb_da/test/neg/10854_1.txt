Well, I've been to a British university, actually I went to one in this very movie, and that wasn't that. This is a horrible, badly made and acted movie. The worst is it could have been really good if they bothered to spend more it 12p on it, in fact if it really would represent real British students, it should be as acted as one and took out a 15,000 pound loan. It says nothing about Uni life, where was the bush cover, teen drinking until 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics ??? Where was the diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I can't remember that Fresher's Week is so horrible and I'm teetotal. And in the end, the question is still ... a bed or a wardrobe?
