Occasionally, some amateurs will come out with a tired piece of action movie production. one is just so wrong, I don't think I should even comment on the plot, the play, the script, the camera work. because it has no !! If you put a muscle guy in cool leather jacket walking in slow-mo and throwing in a funky rap song is the most important ingredient in making a great action movie, so sayonara action movie !!
