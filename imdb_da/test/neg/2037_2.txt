I didn't have anything to do before going out one night so I didn't want to see anything too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. This must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone she slept with, director Raja Gosnell has only made foolish shit and the writing on this is just awful. In which high school can you register without a parent present and not proof of age or previous schooling? They let the kids all come to prom without t-shirts, in hooded leotards, ass shorts and a girl dressed as Eve wearing only fig leaf? She announces that she is 25 and her brother is 23, but there is no retribution from school, parents or any kind of lawsuits against the fraud or espionage newspaper? Dagbladet's manager wants to catch the teacher in a minor sex scandal, but does not understand that the teacher comes on a 25-year-old, so in each case it will be an intervention? Do they allow a camera and record people's private conversations with underage children? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to the HS with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personals use, I wouldn't get in any kind of trouble ??? NAHHHH No problem. Shouldn't she take the gym or go to the toilet at some point? The secondary signs in this were like cardboard cuts of what high school students are supposed to be, and everyone was a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. In what world are parents not suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked by the school's stud for prom? And they don't ask the guy to meet him like any other parent in history. If, for that matter, a guy in my school or any other school had stuck my sister and threw eggs into her prom dress, he would have been in a body for the rest of his life. This movie is so constructed and predictable that it is nauseating and why at the end all (the Alpo girls included) cheer for this chick when they two days before they hated her ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, DUMB AND DUM.
