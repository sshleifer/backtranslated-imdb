The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly will rake the money for this crap. Yes, the US rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia, but did not assess; probably by curious viewers who wondered how bad it would be. Answer: RANDOM, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown, and they do not take the nuances of the Australian written script lightly. Good luck to them as they are doomed to choke with this turkey. My advice to US viewers is not. <br /> <br /> Americans should be advised to find DVDs in ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a different 'zone format' for those issued in the United States. Otherwise, some DVD players will operate discs from both / all zones.
