When I say worse, I mean less entertaining. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last Zombie Bloodbath, making the movie even less tolerable. In the last film, there were no special camera effects, where in this one we are treated on shaky camera and constantly switch to black and white. This is also called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that the zombies are almost not in this. The movie starts in 1945, when some Satanists kill a violent burglar and set him up as a scarecrow. Back in modern times, some children have a car problem and go to a house, the same house where the satanic murder happened. Some believe that people are trying to rape the children (or something) and they bring the scarecrow back to life, which comes back with some zombies and now speaks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets reinforced the language and reduced the violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, check this out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes. Not rated, contains violence and language.
