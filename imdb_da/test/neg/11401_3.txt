This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. The action was just sooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this movie he sounds like he read his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice was extremely wood. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as a boy Fraser, although it probably had more to do with the crazy dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seems that the film's decision makers forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. It all sounded like bookish. <br /> <br /> Some of the situations were very poorly visualized. Example: One place at the beginning of the movie is a scene where a canoe goes into a fast. This bit is just too incredible to be true. You see an overtly shallow river, with many stones just below the surface (hence the fast). We hear some exciting music to warn us that there is danger ahead. A canoe with girls goes into the rather shallow fast. Our full dive then several meters below the surface to save one of the girls. The girl sits in her arms and says the words 'You saved me ...' Spy! <br /> <br /> In fact, it was so bad that it was fun. This is sad because it really wasn't the intention. At the break, I heard a guy behind me say "O God, that's another part!" My feelings exactly. What scares me is that I credited the 'Ik ook van jou' ended credits in English. Does this mean that it will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands started to get a good reputation for films like Antonia (Antonia's line) and 'Character' (Character) ...
