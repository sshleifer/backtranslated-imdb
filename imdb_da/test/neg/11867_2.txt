Meh, sum it up for me really. Drilling history, gentle dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like a fight or a shootout boring? Are you actually having to TRY to do it?), No real characters, etc. Just boring. Snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer, but none of them have come to the surface in any of his DTV work when the opportunity exists to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. Imagine a decent script with a couple of solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive actions, battles, shootouts, etc. How can it be difficult to handle? My personal opinion is that the primary actors in the production just don't care. There is no sign of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man etc? Awesome, intense performances complemented by decent (if not always excellent) writings, good support casts and evil action. None of this is evident in any of these releases so far, which is a huge shame. Distributors hit Wesley's face on the cover and knowing that the audience will look up, as they have not yet realized that they have not seen him in theaters for almost 2 years. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see Snipe's work with someone like Isaac Florentine, who really knows how to make the most of a DTV production, and works with Alpha Stunts, which are just some of the best action - boys out there. Together they would all make a fantastic team and a Snipe action vehicle, we would all be proud to see. <br /> <br /> Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, who chews, but it still sucks a lot.
