Sometimes things should not be done. And while the setup seemed good enough, it only continues to get the audience to intervene in horror. But the problem is, it's not another saw movie. It's just so bad you want you to get punishment from Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I wasted how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the movie. And generally it flowed in its trials. True, telling his team that they should fail every subject to be true players was something funny first, but it became boring to see. It and joke about "Radio" and "iPod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't stand to watch this movie again. Even Trantasia is worth more than this. "D"
