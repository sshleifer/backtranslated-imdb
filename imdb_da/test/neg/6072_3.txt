I was expecting so much more than what I received from watching this movie. It is not that I protest against the literature license (if that is what it should be called), especially when there is no obvious attempt to say "based on a true story". But this film is about Beethoven - a real historical person who is so well-known and so deeply embedded in our musical experiences, and I expected the film to be true to the story at least in the primary elements. This film made such a big exception to the historical record that it could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My assumption (because I hadn't studied the movie at all) was that it was true. Halfway I stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb. The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that this was not correct with history, because it was so hard to believe in much of the story. To enjoy this movie, I was obliged to recognize it as a fantasy, a "what if it was such a" story. The film lacked this honest disclaimer. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was the fictional management of the 9th symphony. The very concept that is depicted in the film stretched my imagination to the adultery. I ended up doubting something other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Ed Harris's accomplishments - an extraordinary actor who knows how to play a role and stay out of it, and it was about it, and for that I give it a 3 / 10th Those who emphasize that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus doesn't have a clue whether either composer life and only looks at what this movie really is, because in the end it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.
