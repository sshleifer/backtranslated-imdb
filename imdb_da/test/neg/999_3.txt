The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an unpleasant menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make much more of this by using the titles of the titles to create all sorts of small phrases that are always designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really pretty messy though. Fellowes does not seem to be interested in presenting the thriller elements in a way that keeps us seated. Rather, his focus is on the moral predictors themselves. The dialogue is inconsistent, stadiumy here, peoples there and with constant surprise of realism oppressed by the occasional clich√© landmine. Although there is nothing slamming about the locations, so the actors can move on with existing ones in their space, the terrible score cannot create an additional dimension and often counteracts the emotional momentum of the given sets. There is also a very prosaic, dare I say the British feel the movie. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle-class people caught in an extraordinary situation I wanted to see some kind of artistic tale of history. Finally, it's actually history that lets the rest down. Just as the tension elements are quite flattened, the story is an asymmetric sum of sub-plates of different shape and size, woven as a means of character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with great performances, and John Warnaby's ebulletin colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome film for much of the browning. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed; Not that it is bad, but that it could have been much better. 3.10
