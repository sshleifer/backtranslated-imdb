This documentary was very amateurish. It could have been made by college students. Provided it was, my character is as follows. Content: C, Sound quality: F, Cinematography: F, Acting: D, Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Boobshot: A ...... Overall grade: D <br /> <br /> I got myself get seasick when we walked down the streets with the signs, bobbing up and down with every movement of cameraman'step.My mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle guy and couldn't hear the muted dialogue. Extensive post-production editing and CGI would not help this bomb. These students would "hardly" pass my course. My advisor ... don't waste your time or money on one "A".
