I can't believe the number of people referring to the protagonists as "boy queues" !! there is no such people !!!! There are cows and bulls and all males in cattle are bulls and have no udder !!!! There was even an actual bull, but it was as if it was another type of animal altogether! my god it's like drawing human ears on a cat, breasts on superman or mickey mouse with blonde shirley temple curls - even in animation it just doesn't work! giving human qualities to the animals is nothing new and one can expect, but changing their actual bodies into essentially is a transsexual figure bizarre for a family cartoon - how many folk editors, writers, producers, animators saw this and didn't know anything better or not say anything - it's absolutely amazing! i am no snob and i love animation - simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even ice age and all the other new ones out there - over the breeding was fantastic - but these are nuts - quite nuts - i couldn't accept that many people are so ignorant, and I continued to hope for a cause for the weeks in the movie - an explanation - no one came - and finally when they stop this little newborn calf and half the stomach is out and they say "it's a boy" I almost the cattle !!!! please, author / create let us in on joke!
