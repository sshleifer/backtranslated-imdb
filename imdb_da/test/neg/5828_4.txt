All in all, this is a movie for children. We saw it tonight, and my child loved it. At one point, my child's excitement was so great that the meeting was impossible. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books are very subtle and hide a sharp intelligence behind the childish quality of his leading characters. This movie was not subtle. It seems a pity that Disney can't see the benefits of making movies from several of the stories on those pages, although it may not be allowed to use them. I found myself the theater replayed "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger too" instead. The cartoon voices were very good. I was only shy of Kanga. However, the music was twice as high in parts as the dialogue and scary for the film. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, it was a bit preaching and militant in tone. Overall, I was disappointed, but I would go again just to see the same tension on my child's face. <br /> <br /> I liked Lumpy's grin.
