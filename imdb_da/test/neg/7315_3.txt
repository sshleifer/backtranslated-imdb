University professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) has made it. A beautiful, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two sweet children. He plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car, and his students love and respect him. But when the temptation calls in the form of one of his bright, beautiful, sexy and willing students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), he indulges in. The next day, he is accused of his rape, and his perfect life could be forever destroyed. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actress in Australian films, we know we are not in favor of a masterpiece. But even seen with low expectations, "Gross Misconduct" is a huge flop. Based on a game with a rather imaginative title and then adapted to a reasonably enjoyable book, it fails to engage, convince or even externally interest the audience at a most basic level. Scripture is awkward and convincing; The action is mostly not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance that demonstrates for one of the first times on the screen its emotional rawness, but she is the only good thing about the movie, which almost seems like it can't wait to be over. <br /> <br /> The direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway, but it is just painfully mediocre. Except for the aforementioned Naomi Watts, which could be forgiven as this was early in his career, the play is timber and is getting worse during the film. The normally reliable Jimmy Smits doesn't seem to have tried this, and who could really blame him? However, all these small failures only add to the film's ultimate fatal error, which is that the focus is on the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of ​​what is basically soft-core entertainment of an adult kind. In the end, the audience will probably be bored, tired and would have done something else with their ninety minutes. Unless you just want to see Naomi getting naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely afford to give this nonevent movie a miss.
