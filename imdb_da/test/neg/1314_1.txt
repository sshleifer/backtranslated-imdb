You would have thought, considering how much this overwhelmed pile of waste has cost, that the budget could have risen to a decent scriptwriter. Instead, they seemed to have chosen a bog standard Hollywood 'Paint by Numbers' disaster movie plot and dialogue. The only cliché they seem to have missed was the sweet kid. But everybody else is there. There are the stupid heroes who were merged by fate with both his former wife and foreign father. There is the baptizing father and the rebellious teenager. There is the 'professor who everyone thought was wrong until it turned out that he was not' (The game terribly of it normally excelled Tom Courtney apparently in the prison of some strong drugs) plus the comic duo wanders in the desert underground railway. <br /> <br /> I sat down to see it full of expectation. The cast, as mentioned, is fantastic. But within minutes it became clear how bad it was to be. Stuff this unusable should come with a warning. Something like; <br /> <br /> 'This movie may have been made in the UK but was aimed at the US market. It therefore contains tired clichés, stock characters, stilted dialogue, and a plot so paralyzed and simplistic that even George W. Bush could understand it. "<br /> <br /> Avoid.
