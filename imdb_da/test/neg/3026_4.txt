Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that do not quite succeed in what they were trying to do. The film is a 76 minute ultra slow, questionable, effective, annoying experience trying to present an exciting philosophy of earth creation and human nature. It opens with god presented as a chair-bound psychopathic man who opens tears with a knife. From fashion, blood and human waste arise, Mother Nature. She continues to impregnate herself with the dead god's sperm. Later she gives birth to the Earth's Son. A retard that is constantly abused by a group of cannibalistic people, whom I believe to be the representation of humanity. <br /> <br /> The "begotten" takes a twisted and disturbing look at the origin of life. Demonstrate the self-destructiveness, violence, desire and greed that has become a trademark of humanity. The problem in the movie comes from two points. One is that the film is just too slow in its exhibition. What we get is a good thirty minutes used to show how the Earth's Sun constantly shakes the naked on the ground while it is melted and tortured by humanity. Such tasteless extension becomes dull rather quickly and lacks the punch in giving a blow to the viewers' senses. Another point is "Beggoten's" visual appearance and sound. The grained, inverted, black and white low frame kinematics anchors the interfering factor of the plot, but such short stories often only work for short periods. Then one gradually begins to lose their effect as the audience gets used to the look. The sound has the same problems. It's constantly repetitive and similar sounds get annoying so fast I wanted to turn off the volume. "Begotten" loses its charm shortly after it begins. It is trying to be original and creative, but it does not extend the ideas suggested by the vague plot instead of repeating the same scene over and over again. In conclusion, the "begotten" stuck for a moment. Although it is plotting, trying to move forward, the images and sound remain the same throughout. Shows the same action in a slightly different way with slightly different sound. A gimmick cannot make a movie alone. It also needs pace and variation, something Merhige seems to have forgotten.
