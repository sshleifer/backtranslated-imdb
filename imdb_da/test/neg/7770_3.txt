To be hones, I used to like this show and watch it regularly, but now (thank goodness!) I don't understand why I saw it. Sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting television shows I've ever seen. I really don't get the point of this show, despite trying. People say Sex and the city are fun. In which way? By cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. I don't understand the plot: We have four girls trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork that comes around. And this show is about four spoiled chicks sleeping with every man in town, but eventually they admit that the best pleasure comes out of the penis vibrators. And yes ... the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship. If you can have a good sex, you are a good man (or wife). It doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart. Size matters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is also bad acting. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so poor and unconvincing that it makes me sick just to see this show. Parker just screams and complains all the time, Cattral shows her old boobs and says "the word" all the time, Davis delivers her smile (and nothing else) and Nixon seems to be bored all the time. And yes ... men are sex - hungry pigs in this show. But judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is offensive to men and women. The women are as primitive and numb as they have no heart, just hunger for sex. It is insulting to everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city are one of the worst TV shows, and I'm glad the show ended because it delivers bad plays and pointless stories. The whole world is not just about sex and vibrators.
