I was only gently enthusiastic when I rented "All Boys Love Mandy Lane" which I instantly remembered to hear and read a wide range of opinions ?? both positive and negative ?? in a short time between its short film release and the distribution towards the video store shelves. It was apparently the most brilliant and refreshing new horror movie this year with non-stereotyped teenagers and unpredictable plot phrases for a change. Okay, the basic concept may sound relatively innovative, but inevitably you will return to the same old and annoying slasher cliches, and even past the point, even the nifty-stylistic marks cannot save the movie from terribly mediocrity. The opening sequences are truly amazing and literally bathed in a moody melancholy mood, which in fact makes it much more painful to watch the scrubbing towards the "ordinary" level of rudimentary slasher flick. After the sublime intro showing a drunken macho child, his jump from a rooftop fails to impress the titular beauty that "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic children who get rocky and horny on a secluded ranch before being killed by a not so unidentified madman. The movie's whole pretentious build-up collapses faster than a shaking card: We never get a proper explanation why Mandy himself behaves so fat and haughty towards all his admirers (because she grew up with orphans perhaps? Oh, boo-hoo), shows the boys soon enough that they would settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the "divine" Mandy and the final twist ?? albeit undeniably offbeat ?? is just plain meaningless. The middle section is pretty dull and doesn't even give any really horrible tension (shotgun killings? Please!) Or authentic rancid sleaze. My generous rating of 4 out of 10 goes entirely to the grainy and disturbing 70s movie recording (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images?) And the surprisingly wonderful soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine chose the classic Bobby Vinton song "Sealed with a Kiss" to play under the trailer and final credit, while I was initially convinced that the film would inevitably involve Barry Manilow's cheesy chanting song "Mandy".
