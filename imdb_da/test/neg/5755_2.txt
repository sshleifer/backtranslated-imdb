Back to Frogtown was a hard movie to trace. Now I have achieved this mission, and it had been on the shelves for quite some time. Wish it was kept that way! First of all, Sam Hell is of course not Roddy Piper. He is replaced by a guy with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft for that part! Sam Hell must be rebellious and amazing. Here he gets caught three times! What kind of hero is it? Spangle is also replaced here by another actress. Why didn't we get different characters here? This was stupid! Lou Ferrigno stars in this movie and he is not even the hero. Common sense says Lou is the movie's hero! Bad effects, bad action and just a forgettable movie. Fun as they shoot at Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was fun and not a bad movie! I really wanted to return to Frogtown, but I just screamed when the battle scenes started. This movie makes Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid this or you will be the one who sings "more rough, greener, speaks turtle tv dinner!"
