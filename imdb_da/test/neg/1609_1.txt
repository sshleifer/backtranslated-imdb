I start by confessing that I usually really enjoy action movies (military or otherwise). I'm a guy. But this boy was horrible. I saw it free, showtime or hbo and still feel that I have paid too much. It was a prolonged episode of the ordinary hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1, only because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why 59 others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 boggles my mind. Unless they are all family members of the crew or crew. <br /> <br /> It could be, this movie was so bad, many bailed out ....... and as such were too uninvited to disturb. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry repetitive, but the 10-line minimum seems stupid, for what essentially boils down to a warning ......... hoping to save others 2 hours of black hole represent this movie. Trust me, stare at an empty wall, they will be more action.
