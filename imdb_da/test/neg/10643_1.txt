Some kind of awards must be given to `Hellraiser: Bloodline '. It is actually full moon full moon. It carries all the marks off, for example. Your 'Demonic Toys' or 'Puppet Master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? Full Moon can get away with stupid product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, man, they take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (even though it's not as stupid as I have seen to see it), once made up for its low budgets by being stylish. Now it's just ish.
