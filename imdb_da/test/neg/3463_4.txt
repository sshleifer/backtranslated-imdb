Leatherheads is an apt title, but a leather strap would be more useful to self-flagging itself after purchasing a ticket to see this damaging attempt at entertainment. Clooney's attempt at self-exhilarating humor comes across with a silent threat, as his behavior means he is anything but. Perhaps with another actor playing the Clooney role, the movie may be marginally tasty. Sorry George, I doubt any Oscar nods this time. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy (unless you refer to his policy). Anyway, only the most keen of Clooney fans will enjoy watching Leatherheads, everyone else will long for the day of the silent picture.
