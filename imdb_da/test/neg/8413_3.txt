For a movie that received so much recognition and rated this spinoff for "Rosemary's Baby" a big mistake. It starts that Andrew / Adrian, regardless of his name, is because he is so confused that he doesn't know who he is running away from a cult with his mother and soon kidnapped by a strange lady who ends up taking care of him as whether she was his mother The play is horrible when Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks awful with his submerged face, never ending with grin and dukes of Hazard clothing, looking more like a drunk than Satan's son. In fact, it's all he does, drinks, and falls in fun of himself as he tries to address his past and the last memory of his mother drives away on a bus screaming at him. He finds a friend who seems to be an angel, but he is quickly killed and electrified in a hillarious scene, where he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew is being driven and the cult with the first part members tests him to see if he really is Satan's son. His stupid self fails the test and gets out of the altar, glittering with mystical makeup and jumping on stage in a nightclub and dancing like a clown on crack !!! This scene is memorable and worth seeing. The end is horrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. Do not look at this piece of waste or you will lose respect for the first part.
