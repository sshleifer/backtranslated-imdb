This has to be assessed with the worst movies I've ever seen. It was just not fun. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the kind of person who goes in every gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it can do something for you. If you expect a comedy movie to have some humor in it, then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer who says the f word very funny. The stripes in the club put on their underwear, so there was not even a little nudity to relieve boredom. What happened in the strip club didn't make any sense at all. There was much murmuring of the protagonist with whom I had no sympathy at all. Mena Suvari was hardly in the movie, probably just there to make people believe it was a serious attempt to produce a movie. The bad guys were convincing and brought as much threat as a dead sheep.
