Look, some movies have become worst ever. I suggest it may be India Song. When I watched the film in 1976, it played at Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place visited by people who care about movies. From about halfway through, people were simply flooded out of the theater. My girlfriend wouldn't let us leave, but at the end the theater was almost empty. I kept telling people when they left it "the good part is still coming." And that was that. The good part was the screen at the end, which said "fine". That was the only good part. I'm still annoyed by this movie 24 years later. It was meaningless, stupid and derived (Marienbad, part 2). See it only if you want to spend an endless two-hour learning to distinguish between simply poor and simply horrible.
