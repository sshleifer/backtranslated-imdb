How terrible is that? Let me count the way: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that begins to be about a UFO study and turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the decision makers in this movie felt so strong about their message, why spoil it? It irritates non-believers and pushes the fence sits in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They're scary! 3) The play is terrible. They act as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) The cinematography is home movie poor. Wait, actually, it's not even that good. 5) Script bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, no action. As a tennis match, they jump back and forth between "talking head" close-ups. 6) Direction ... what direction? Oh, there must have been an instructor there somewhere. I challenge you to find out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments on this movie. The editing seemed professional but couldn't make a difference. Good editing of bad material is still a bad movie. The open theme music was actually very good! Very scary and ufo-ish. It was too bad that the film was not about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can't tell already, here's the bottom line. I wasted my money watching this movie and it made me angry. If they hadn't disguised what this movie really was about, I could say it was my fault.
