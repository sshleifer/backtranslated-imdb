They should make the terrorists see this video as torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene where you look up and strike a woman with mental problems, is apparently a comedy source. About half an hour of this would convince even the most sinister fundamentalist to waste the prayers instead of sitting through another minute of this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. I rented it because a friend said it was fun, only to find that he was talking about the blowhard director who makes the comment rather than the movie itself. I think if you find unobstructed arrogance fun, you will like this. Apparently, he continues to become chickens, he is "banged", the most tasteless example is when the leading actress comes on the screen. In fact, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - Her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible poop. This is apparently the only movie she's made according to IMDb, I hope she's involved in theater or indie stuff, since I think she has the talent and the natural beauty to really be an asset to any production.
