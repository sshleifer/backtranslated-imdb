In general, I prefer horror movies that crawl so much, I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not those where people seem stupid and are killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of the legend is a dog-faced lizard green-gray monster that lobsters like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a series of sharp spines sticking out from the back and sucking the blood of domestic animals. As in many horror films, good and bad, this movie takes freedom with the legend. It not only attacks humans, but it eats their intestines and has a shot-tight, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me how can a hypodermic needle penetrate the skin when bullets can't? And why, when the marines figure out that the armor muscles can do it, do they split up so that chupacabra can pick them up one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a show that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also deserve credit for their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the play was poor to bad, just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
