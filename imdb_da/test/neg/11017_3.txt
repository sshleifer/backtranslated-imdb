I really wanted to like this movie, but after a fun opening few minutes I barely snapped a smile. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two leaders and the other characters were cliche rides. The script completely wasted Bud Talent's and Kim Gyngell's talents. <br /> <br /> It must be said, however, that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smash of applause at the end. Maybe I just couldn't relate to that enough. I'm just glad I went on cheap tickets.
