It's the kind of movie that is loved by 50-year-old school teachers and people who consider themselves socially aware - but haven't really got a clue. The actors - I think everyone is amateur - do their best, but the script is so full of clich√©s and stupidity that they can't save it. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the scool cabaret kids work on - bringing back all your worst memories of actors in school. The lyric of one of the songs goes something like this in a quick translation 2.30 in the morning: "I am the community's dwarf, an emotionally paralyzed individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
