This is an interesting way to handle a camera, especially for a DTV movie - the version I saw was full screen <br /> <br /> - but it doesn't fall under the scenarios. First, you get about 20mn of talk, talk, talk in a will-be-hip, post-"trainspotting" way, so it's slasher city. And then comes the most dishonest cheating ending I've seen much worse than <br /> "April Fool's Day" - where it certainly made sense. So everything in <br /> <br /> is the old song and dance: interesting instructor tests <br /> <br /> hard but deserve better movie. Fun: It's usually the actors who are in desperate need of something better ?? Skip it at all, for your time
