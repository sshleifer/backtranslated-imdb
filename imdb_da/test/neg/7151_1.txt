Help I've ended up in a movie hell! What a totally stupid movie this is. Really nothing is good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly widespread: An anti-EU terrorist group is chasing a bunch of guys driving around in Western Europe carrying a Delivery of transparent bags filled with xtc pills. And the worst thing is: They are serious about it! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of action should put a lot of shame on all the faces involved. <br /> <br /> 3) Some cashier guys decided to let everybody speak English so that the international market would catch on. Ugliest advertising ever! The French and Dutch mother tongue speaks smart but everything makes sense, and the result is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 4) The audio track is completely misplaced and poorly chosen. <br /> <br /> 5) The camera, editing and effects are supposed to be of some post noir road movie kind of style, but are hardly worth anything and not meant to accompany this story (read: anti-story). 6) Hidde Maas. Wildschuts never fail to convince. A true actor. Normally I would give an extra point just for his sake. But no excuse, not this time, I just didn't want to forgive myself ...
