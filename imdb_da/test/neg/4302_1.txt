As much as we may welcome a movie dealing with people who have different challenges in romance, I cannot shake the feeling that this movie was intended as a porn movie from direct to video grade, where either A ) the actors relied on making the explicit scenes, or B) the producers ran out of money to hire for the stakes (a great thing if that were true). I had to go back to Blockbuster to find out why I had rented it in the ground, which was due to an unapproachable credibility with regard to the blurbs of the cover, which seemed to involve a creepy John Waters style humorous party with a sexual theme . Okay, I laughed a few times and it certainly has a sexual theme (though most of it cannot be described as stimulating in any way). But on some movies you can rewind to make sure you have heard the dialogue correctly - on this you are fast-paced because you already know what they're about to say. But there is nothing to speed up, so just fast forward past it on the shelf.
