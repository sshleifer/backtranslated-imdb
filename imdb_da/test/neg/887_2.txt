I have honestly not seen this movie for many years, but the few times I tend to do parts of it hold on to my memory that anyone who has seen it will understand. I saw the first thing as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early 60s, and it scared hell out of us kids in a fun way. I can remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown, lurking in the maze. I can't risk renouncing the end, except saying it was surprising to say the least. I vaguely remember the whole crowd of young boys who released a big scared holler, followed by laughter as the horrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentional fun climaxes for a movie in film history, yet strange motion in a way. You have to see it yourself, which is not easy these days. I don't know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.
