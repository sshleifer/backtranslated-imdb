Ben Stryker an ex-green beret stops at a small town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend Tick Rand. Soon after entering the city on his Suzuki and settled in. A motorcycle gang known as 'The Savages', led by the tyrant Pigiron invades and finally takes over the place. Stryker does not want to get involved, but it changes when his friends become the real targets. Is there anything good to say about this scuzzy topic? Tough calls as the only basic reason to see this low-budget wreckage is for the huge b-thrown crew managed to get hold of this project. Although I do not think it is a complete botch job, it is not very good either. Now what a cast! Lance Henriksen (who is the main character, he oddly doesn't have top billing, but the final one), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now what went wrong with this scummy low budget bungle. The superficiality of the material is too one-dimensional, it heavily borrows ideas from better movies (namely, Mad Max) and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just don't gels and could have been better thought out. The cliches being used can be manipulated to a good view, even though it is predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to make it scary all of it without letting the viewer whip it all up. Castings are mostly wasted in no roles. A bleached blonde Henriksen is very solid and even with his forthcoming presence, which gives a mysterious glow to his character. He doesn't come to hell much, and sometimes goes into action. Too much sideline action, but when he kicked some cycles, they floated good times. Karen Black's elevator performance is a very strange one and is about screaming and curse. Although she comes into a memorable disaster with Claudia Udy's flirtatious receding character Katie. A wheelchair bound George Kennedy wanders around aimlessly until the final assault, and Richard Lynch looks embarrassingly like a colorless priest / city mayor in a very redundant role. A front edge Bill Forsythe simply chews up as the head of the infamous biker package. The eerie story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has the cheesy cartoon getup and much influenced by the Western genre. Just look at the bad guys for that. How they came up with their names is mystery. Maybe they took them out of a hat. It is quite a different set of material that more often moves on a treacherous scene after another. Unfunny comical items are chucked in and also a bit of sleaze. Tacky exploitation that doesn't get gritty enough and the deaths are pretty ridiculous. A clumsy script is filled with coinciding details and unbearable trite. Simon Nuchtern's spotted direction was at the numbers and the fog laid out. One or two intense scenes cannot make up for their tortoise-like pacing and many hand-held stunts. The cardboard sets had a dirty appearance, but lacked the ecological sense. The gravely filmography of Gerald Feil was better handled as the main focus was not on the city, but on the desolate background (like the beginning and end of the climax of the movie) with some nice camera keys. Pino Donaggio's lumpy music selection has been drowned by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is a forgettable quickie midnight movie that is a particular misfire for the most part. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk out there.
