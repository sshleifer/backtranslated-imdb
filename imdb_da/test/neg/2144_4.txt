BLACK EYE (2 out of 5 stars) Unreasonably filmed 70s action movie looks like it was made for TV ... only the occasional cuss word and a lesbian subplot tip you that the movie was actually made to appear in theaters. Fred Williamson plays a hard guy ex-cop who becomes a hard guy private eye. He stumbled across a couple of murders and attempted murder associated with a mysterious stick. There are some fistfights, a bullit-inspired car hunt, a pretty original elevator scene and even time for Williamson to confront the rich, lesbian lover of his girlfriend (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene with Williamson bullying a poor old man by tearing some priceless old autographed pictures into his memorabilia shop. Yeah, way to go, hard guy ... maybe you can find a crawl to look up later? Obviously, this movie doesn't have enough edge or enough originality to make much of an impression.
