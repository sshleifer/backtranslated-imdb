Lucille Ball cannot sing or act or dance. This makes the quality of her performance in MAME the more terrible. She is not allowed to make low-brow slapsticks that made her a hit on television, so she has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Ms Ball never learned the skill because none of the sore moments have any heat. How does she really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words she says. The vacancy of Mrs. Ball supposes to convince us that she is against, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur at all. Therefore, every scene she is in flat. <br /> <br /> In addition, mr. Ball opens his mouth to sing, we immediately become aware of the reason why the studios called her voice to any other musical she stared into earlier in her career. It was said that she demanded her voice be used so that it is a mistake in ego as well as leadership. It gets worse when she sings in voice-over, and she has to "act the moment" without words. Anyone who thought it would work, forgot who played Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell had the role on stage and in the movie AUNTIE MAME. I'm also aware that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for her performance in the original 1966 musical Broadway. None of these women were known for their singing voices, but both could have pulled out better than Lucille Ball. Why they went with her is the worst in overtly miscasting. <br /> <br /> The only person who comes out rude is Bea Arthur. She is big and wonderful, catty and ordinary in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you continue to wait for this movie to start and invite you to join in the fun. But the film never does and you can't. No one besides Bea Arthur seems to have fun. <br /> <br /> Another bad review goes to Director Gene Saks. Scissors are known as an award winning instructor of musicals and comedies for the stage and screen, including the Broadway musical this film is based on. None of this skill and expertise is here. The poor editing and storytelling quailty in this movie is under a director of his caliber. The sharp mistake in the performance of the movie is not to blame for Ms Ball.
