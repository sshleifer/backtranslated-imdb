Worthless film. A complete waste of time and nothing I expected to be. The packaging makes it seem like it is by the American Pie genre (it's not). Rather, it's a ridiculous confusion of coincidence that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise (let's see how many mix ups we can enter to get what should have been a bad SNL shit in a presentation full length). The noteworthy thing is that the director's (based on their comments on the DVD) takes himself seriously. I've been a big fan of the films that National Lampoon names its name until and including Van Wilder. With this one I feel completely cheated. In fact, I feel DUPED. I was expecting a Van Wilder as a farce to relive my college days, but instead was earned an hour and a half of garbage. What leads to my ultimately unformed expectations? Well to begin with, the fact that the cast all seems naked (with a huge sausage covering what needs to be covered) on the cover of the DVD. Add to that pictures on the back of the case as well as the description, and you mislead people into believing it is a movie that it is not. To make matters worse, the movie, as you might expect with half-naked, full-time college students trying to stunt a photo, begins, but in the end it has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, I didn't even understand that the folks in the open sequence were supposed to be the characters in the movie until I was told by the commentators in the commentary. Don't make me wrong, I love plot twists and get surprised by movies, but I hate the fact that this movie is trying to pawn itself as something it is not. In the end, it makes itself a huge disservice (artistic, but probably not economical) because it sets the audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it announces. <br /> In short, do not rent this movie based on what you see in the case. It's not your usual National Lampoon movie. The only thing that is fun about it is that many of the actors have appeared in other film and television shows that make their engagement here entertaining.
