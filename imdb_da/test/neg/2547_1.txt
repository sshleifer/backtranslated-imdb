What a horrible movie! It perfectly represents the state of degeneracy in French society, where the most elementary respect for sound values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The reason is unwise, the film is not fun at all and the characters are completely superficial and uninteresting. At least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the usually good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems completely lost in a sea of ​​vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. I can't help drawing a parallel with the wonderful James Ivory's "Le Divorce" with its thought-provoking depiction of French and American Moors, its superlative cinematography and stellar cast being used for good. Having seen "Le Divorce" you can feel some kind of empathy with the French, regardless of their feelings. "Belle-Maman" leaves you only a nausea disdain for its moral bankruptcy and clueless protagonists.
