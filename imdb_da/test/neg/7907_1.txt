Frankly, I didn't think there was anything humorous about this movie. It was really bad and badly done without any plot at all. Surprisingly, I got some chuckles from me at the beginning with the Malcolm X terminal, and it was about it. Seriously, Soul Plane even made the worst movies that Gigli look like an Emmy winner. This movie is really not worth seeing unless of course you were blind as Johnny Witherspoon played the blind man in the movie (another sad character). I cringed by the majority of the stereotypical jokes and destroying Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley by casting them in this movie. This movie can be summarized in a single sentence. Nashawn wins $ 100,000,000 and creates her own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, I mentioned sex? If I could, I would rate this movie in the negative integers, but the beginning was entertaining, bringing this movie to a 1/10. Make the "t bag" pfft!
