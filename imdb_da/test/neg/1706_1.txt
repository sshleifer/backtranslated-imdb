This is a movie about two mysteries (which I have now demystified). First, did the filmmakers understand the concept of "parody" before using it to blanket the bomb audience throughout the film? Parody is when a reproduction tries to mock, comment or pay tribute through self-defeating humor to the original work. In other words, there must be reason to parody such work and they should certainly be wise. I didn't see any of them in the movie. I saw some horrible 10 second jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said "hello, I was full last night and watched survivors, and had this brain speed for a direct to DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script ... because I'm planning to fix this movie without one! "<br /> <br /> And here is the second mystery: Eric Robert's career. I use to think that Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now I realize it's because he's stupid (and therefore deserves the career he had). Having watched this movie, it is obvious that he would have been better off if he had entered the mainstream adult film which has higher budgets, more ... intense scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate and compelling plot lines and a much wider audience than this B-movie reject (C-movie?).
