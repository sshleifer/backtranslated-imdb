Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A perfectly good hunk like Antonio Sabato Jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel comes out of his mouth. I cringed at 95% of the dialogue! It would have been better to have made the character a dumb! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare could talk these lines without losing control of a bodily function is beyond me! If Michale Pare's character prefaced or ended a more phrase with the word 'But', I think I would have thrown the iron through the TV (I love to multitask - especially to get through bad movies). Must have been a lean year for both to join this movie. Washing machines for living would probably look good to them now. And the bad guy ...... if he was so bad why not just shot the rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. Even the title was a malformation. A 'Crash Landing' means that the plane actually crashes and does not land without even a fire or someone is injured. Instead of landing safely, the plane must be crashed and burned like the script. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS A STINK!
