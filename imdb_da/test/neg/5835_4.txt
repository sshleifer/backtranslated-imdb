I challenge you to watch this movie and deny the above statements. That is, if you can stop looking at her almost flawless face. She also does a little battle and a little shooting, but not as much as I had hoped for. The movie is extremely slow and low budget, but at least they tried to find an excuse for the spacecraft that was so underpopulated; almost the entire crew is on "suspended animation" and the ship is moving on auto pilot! And the heroine does not save any of them, or bring anything useful back "at home"; It seems that the vicious lady traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the missiles jumping into the ship at the end. There are also some long, but rather tame, soft core images, and a few "Alien" rip-off monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 out of 4
