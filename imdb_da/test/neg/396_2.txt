Kazuo Komizu, who has not made a decent movie, instructed this "infamous" shocker and was ashamed that it was a hit on his Japanese release. Yes, it contains scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but then what? It has the style of a poor American porn movie shot and poorly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social actions. <br /> <br /> There is a big difference between this and the scare that is well-produced. <br /> <br /> Just because a person likes their movie theater a bit wet does not mean they will accept crap like this. On the contrary, this kind of fan (myself for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he has seen so much and has become too critical. It's a shame that manufacturing companies are not aware of it. One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film's "near obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. The topic is never the problem. The question is how this topic is dealt with. In ENTRAILS OF AN EXCELLENT WOMAN, it is so amazingly treated that it is boring. Personally, I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an exciting context) if the material is well-documented, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is dull.
