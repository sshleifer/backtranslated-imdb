This movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me scream: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes the film "Yes Man", but directly "this" may have to stick to writing. I'm so disappointed because I heard the whole great review. I was expecting something that beat up. They say this is from the maker of "Knocked up"? Why can't I see the similarity? but it just felt like a low, overdone-themed movie for me. I am so disappointed. In fact, it's not bad if you consider it your average chick movie, but the character of the "band guy" just comes on my nerves. Maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to the movie, but yes they have some fun lines and scene, but I didn't feel the originality. And the end makes the movie a little better. At least the end is not a boring clich√©.
