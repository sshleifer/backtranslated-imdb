Some years back, this movie was scheduled to broadcast on TCM UK as part of a Tod Browning retrospective ?? but what they actually showed was 1937 remake! my brother had seen it (and in retrospect it followed the original pretty scene-by-scene, even down to the set design)? Although no classic, he said it was a far more satisfying experience than the incredibly creaking past version? <br /> <br /> This was the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had great hopes for it ?? but these were swollen as it became evident after the first move of boring conversation that the film's main concern was to appease the silent novel sound technique, and the result is therefore stagey and extremely static. The thriller plot is also not exciting; Even less appetizing is the seemingly British-Indian setting (with the accents of the character and the behavior of the upper class, not to mention the use of corny idiosyncratic idioms such as "I say", "rather" and "look now" makes the whole more than anything else )! <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there are a couple of unintentional howlers: Margaret Wycherly (as a fake medium) invokes police inspector Lugosi (if anything, his undeniable screen presence is already evident) to give her some time to " train out as the dual murder's sins really are (the evidence points to his own daughter played by Leila Hyams!)? she hears a tapping and is deceived into thinking that the spirit world has really contacted her, but then Lugosi enters the room and in her unmistakable accent she tells directly "I knocked twice 锟 斤 拷 you did not hear me! "where my brother and I almost fell to the floor in the convulsions of laughter !!; editing is also really sloppy: during a high angle jump of the main setting is a mike quickly pulled outside the camera area ?? and even worse are a few cases where a person goes off-screen, apparently in the next shot, to another part of the set, but each shot is held on the other actors for an absurdly long time, so it seems to take forever for this person to walk only a few steps !! <br /> <br /> The THIRD HEIGHT marks the third non-horror Browning Talkie that I have seen ?? Although both this and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deal with murder and occultism and therefore still can be linked to the genre. It's much said about the director's seemingly slack with the sound of the sound: But unfortunately, even though they may be, the 4 straight horror movies he did during the 30's are infinitely better than the rest? as I have always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that Browning was not so much at sea during this period as it has been suggested ??
