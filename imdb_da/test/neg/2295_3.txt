This Swedish splatter movie tries to parody / mimic American horror films such as "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. Author / director / actor / film photographer Anders Jacobsson and author / producer / actor / makeup effects supervisor Göran Lundström (did I miss something?) Was naturally inspired by Sam Raimi. But the camera's work is a bad copy of what can be seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users have written that they enjoy humor in this movie, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> The movie was disturbed than entertained me. It is trying to combine excitement and comedy, and the final product left me with a sense of oppression, even though it wasn't scary or shocking at all. The combination of different genre elements made this film very strange. I was never sure if it was going to be scary or fun. The story is quite inventive, except for the showdown in the hospital, but I didn't like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above. The gore and make-up effects are considerably good, and at least the "Loose Limbs" sequences were quite entertaining because the filmmakers in these scenes did not attempt to mix scare and jokes. All in all, a weird movie that you either hate or love. Rest in pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stick to US productions)
