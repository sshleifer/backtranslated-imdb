You know you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is done completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer without any melody or rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how anyone could take this movie seriously, even though it makes a bad review. This movie is way under 'bad'. <br /> <br /> The continuity of this movie is outrageously slaughtered. In a battle situation, we turn the hero (wearing blue jeans and undershirt) a corner with two revolvers in his hand; he doubles back, only now he has two semi-automatic in his hands; he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands; he chases down one time and comes out (suddenly dressed in standard army fatigue jacket) with a shotgun; after which he leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here is one for the books - a bus slips into a car with high speed; the car goes flying, thrown by a gigantic explosion - cut to the bus, which is completely unharmed from the same explosion? The narrative continuity suffers from an equally emotional sense of unreality; the bad guys will really kill the hero - of course - but every time they knock him out or otherwise get him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide they want him "to live to see this!" Huh? One of the more fun moments in the movie is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him; then the evil one decides that he will not let the two meet; and this despite the fact that the villain, hero and his lawyer all know what is going on anyway, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer, and then we see that the note is being sent to the lawyer by another prisoner, even though we never see the hero give it to him. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to ATF's California offices, including its confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, but it's a thoughtless action movie - so how are the action scenes? Not badly surprising; Unfortunately, they are trusted by about a dozen Hong Kong movies made five or ten years earlier. The opening scene, a shooting in a junker garage, actually has shots whose composition is stolen directly from "Hard Boiled" - so obviously, it is a wonder that John Woo is not a defendant for plagiarism. <br /> <Other Hong Kong stolen movies include "Fire in prison", "Island on Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (also "Supercop"). I thought I also recognized a few Sammo Hung clips here. In other words, the action scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful duplications of action scenes from other films. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with this movie unless a shot tastes and just needs a lot of visual stimuli that needn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Very fun movie, for all the wrong reasons.
