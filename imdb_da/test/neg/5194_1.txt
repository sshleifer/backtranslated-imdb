I can pretend that no knowledge of film or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love her people. In July my 14 year old son and I traveled to Cappadocia, Turkey to find some remnants of the neighborhood where his grandfather, Iordanis, lived until the great exodus of Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the movie's summary (refugees from Odessa) You believed that I might be able to learn more about the forced migrations of modern Greeks. If I didn't have a home in Rhodes, I hadn't been to Greece 28 times for so many years, I wasn't familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece, and if I had never had the friendship with these ebullient, life-poisoned people, I could have thought that this complaint had something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at a New Jersey State College, let me assure you that I am familiar with the history of the film period. In fact, my wife's uncle was murdered by the Communists during the Communist grip of power. My mother-in-law lived through the Italian invasion and German occupation ... barely. These signs on the screen speak Greek, they belong to Greek music, but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course they are not humans at all, but just allegories. They are what the artist discovers when life doesn't quite fit or is insufficient for his perception of how it was or should have been. All represent some aspects of post WWI Greece that larger outside forces sent to a fate they did not deserve. As we shot in the late 70s in America: "The revolution did not happen." For an ideologue / artist there is no joke. It is actually a reason to put us through two and a half hours of pain. And that's all because the different powers (Elenis soliloquy of "guards" in various colored uniforms) did not allow the generation after the "1919 Aristocrats (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (Nikos and his music co-musicians, ie the movement , the reason). This dark, surrealistic revisionism unfolds the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their desire for life through the tragedies of the 20th century to achieve more than any of their neighbors in the Balkans, to be so politically developed and globally integrated.
