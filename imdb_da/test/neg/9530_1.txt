The Variety reviewer said this was "over-written and slow" and I agree with that. It has some events that seem compelled and unlikely, as when Cal (Crudup once again as "lost, free and kind of boring" man) and Julianne Moore find a map of the United States in the form of an incredible place. The story is one of the 1970's "guy must find meaning in his life" stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his first role playing the role of Cal. The whole "frame the way to find meaning in life" theme is still interesting enough. Does it really help the family back? I wasn't so sure. The action is okay, I especially liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have support roles. I would give it a 'five'.
