GOOD: Technomusic accompanies medieval swords. Also, the movie looks slimmer than most b-movies, but let's look it out: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. BAD: Unintelligent plot, no acting and incredible universe. I can usually see the possibility of even very bad movies; heck, i love a good B movie like "Split Second" and likes. But this one has nothing but boredom and clich√© to offer. Completely predictable from start to finish. Oh, and I forgot the miserable special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than something out of the myth! The use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Simply boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's sexier!
