--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- <br /> This was it The worst of the series, it is horror disguised as political satire and it is so subtle as a sledgehammer, not particularly scary and not very insightful. Does Micheal Moore have anything to do with this piece of Garbage? <br /> <br /> I'm really sick of Hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and repeating the same voice points repeatedly. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike the movie that subtly tackled the problems soldiers returning from Vietnam with cleverly, the protagonist came back as a blood-demanding zombie and slowly built on this theme: it was a true horror movie that were also good social comments because it was not sanctimonious, exploitave and preachy. I think Joe Dante thought this was trying to make a horror movie to scare Republicans, Conservatives and Libertarians and I was the last in this list found this movie to be completely ridiculous, manipulative and exploit at the same time, and I Do not believe the good type of exploit that you often find in "drive-in" type films, I mean exploiting in the most disease and staggering way: Using the death of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This movie assumes that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against a conservative president if they were to come back to life as zombies, which is a false premise, for which I remember most of it and goes by George Romero's rules; Zombies are thoughtless, carnivorous creatures working with pure impulse, and while Zombie Andy in DeathDream could speak, he couldn't really hold a conversation and he was driven by his dependence on human blood. Okay, zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and of course they are dead, so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place? My interpretation of this movie is that the only war that a liberal democrat can win is to have thoughtless, dead people vote for him. I suppose they thought to say the people who vote for Presidents like George Bush are the mindless zombies while the real mindless zombies are actually those who make the intellectually sound decisions. Yes, no matter what. Dawn of the Dead addressed this idea much better, but uses the idea of ​​mindless consumerism. This movie is not Dawn of the Dead by any means of imagination. <br /> <br /> The movie solves the problem while the soldiers live, a majority of them voting for a Bush president, but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they are zombies who Usually considered brain-dead beings and ridiculously have destroyed them after voting. <br /> <br /> To make a zombie movie Mr. Dante and invoking George Romero's name in it, you have better mindless zombies who like ripping people apart and eating their gut, not zombies that are voting. I also like how the zombies just go "evil" conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social comments, skip this badly crafted, preaching piece of junk and watch DeathDream instead. <Br /> <br /> The worst of the Master of Horror Series hands down.
