I used to believe that "Army of the Dead", but this crap of crap could not make the former movie look like "The Godfather" !! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Make the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes to performing, put it that way, I went to a game with my 6 year old niece in it, and she gave an Oscar worthy performance, compared to those D-List (and that's good about it) actors and actresses. So basically, if I had a gun in my head and head to choose to watch this movie again or cut off my own arm with a dull knife, it's a hard choice! You know what, who needs two arms anyway?
