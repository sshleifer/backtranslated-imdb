When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie, as Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. But this movie is not that fun, and it is also a bit boring. You can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long after a movie that is supposedly only forty minutes long. So I can honestly say it's not a movie that is on my favorite list. It may work for some people, but it just didn't work with me at all, which turned out to be quite slow in building with almost nothing that amused me throughout the film. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very gentle actors and actresses. The prerequisite for the film was potential, just like Quaid's casting, but all that just sputtering and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary. Permitted, the one dream sequence that the child had when he jumped on the bed, and it suddenly became a blood bubble, was very well finished and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be scary instead of one called comedy as its first genre.
