This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh at it or shake your fists in anger. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with many issues in American history, but with the typical white-Christian-American paternalism: The protagonist is one of those I can do, do it all and you've made it love me . He is so pompous and not being taken seriously at all times. What a horrible creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and a still very laughing, but stronger character in the end. However, she still forgets her cunning ways after leaving her for the second time. It's just sad that the sign didn't change at all. Although she has to portray a strong and independent woman at last, she becomes the consumption of concern over her adventurous husband. So 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us (and that's just for the good intentions ...)! The problem of Indian repression is treated fairly nicely, but there is aging storytelling again. And the fact that all African American characters are the typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so disgusting most of the time! So a point (to try) from the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know the movie was made at another time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of the dated views. But it was just disgusting! <br /> <br /> What saves this movie is the parts without the main character. Sir. Dix's plays are way above the top and alleyways. Maybe that's why his character is so uncomfortable ... I liked Mrs Dunne's performance, even though her character was upset at times. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that the famous rush scene was incredibly made. And the way the Oklahoma building was portrayed made the film worthwhile. It's just amazing how civilization rose from the 19th century dirt and dust. And I don't understand the problem some have with that church scene. I thought it was quite fun and entertaining. Maybe it shouldn't be, but I liked it. Then 9 points for these scenes and the impressive story of the development of the Oklahoma state. It makes about 4 points altogether!
