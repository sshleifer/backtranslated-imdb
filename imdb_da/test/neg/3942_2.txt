Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I call attention, it was the trailer and not the cartel. <br /> <br /> The subject of the movie centered on a video I play that was created by a Countess to kill the people and to live forever is acceptable. First, that a very bad movie of horror sees the blood more or less triggered (spread gossip), these scenes softened, they are the more bad. /> <br /> But really, so much is this movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all aspects. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, trailer good, movie bad. I am not acting (as like) since they spend (consuming) money and time making these pointless movies and too bad.
