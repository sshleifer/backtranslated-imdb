The sound of this movie is a nightmare. That's the best I can say to this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost when the movies start. The premise of the film sounds good. A playboy that comes to terms with the people around him. The reason is predictable and very boring. The wet T-Shirt competition can be the worst scene I have ever seen and is almost worth seeing in a Mystery Science type deal. The sound is sometimes hard to hear and the main actor does not seem to know how to speak clearly. His accent makes him very difficult to understand. The only bright sport is the action of Penelope Ann Miller. Her role is underdeveloped, but she plays well. In short, don't waste your time.
