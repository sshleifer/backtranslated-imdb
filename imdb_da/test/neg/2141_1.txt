I can't get over how horrible this movie was. My eyes will jump out of my head and my ears move blood from the horrible horrible a song soundtrack. There are four children and dog, and they run away from a hospital, so get away with stealing two cars and a bus. No one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them. The action is just so horrible, it sounds like an instructional video for social class. I can't think of one thing I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the child who lost her dog made me throw up. He gets his dog back without the lady herself watching the dog run out of the door. Maybe the dog tried to escape this movie. Then there is something horse-riding all over the mix. It was torture to watch this movie. So in the end, the eldest boy says something about staying together, not a crime, and they hug him and love him. Gasoline is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have gone to the juvenile hall or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
