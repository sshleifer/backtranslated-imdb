With a humor that would appeal to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer will find it meaningless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network announced this show, it was made to look like it was a great drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and officials trying to catch the sheep. <br /> <br /> When it came out on the air, I was disappointed with how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally bland animation. The only thing that puts it close to humor was the names of the "Private Public" and "General Specific" characters, a few vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington pummeled with her steel wig. <Br /> <br /> A bit of the subject, but I can't see why the sheep would fall in love with the bullet of dirty cotton balls called "Swanky." It was horrible!
