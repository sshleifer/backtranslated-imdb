.... You get this stupid excuse for a children's play rip-off! Man, what did they think? First, they reveal with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie, so they fool as such. Variety Languages â€‹â€‹Hateers! Well, to be honest, I've seen this as a child, and it scared me a little, simply because I was under the age of assuming that Pinocchio wouldn't do it, wah wah wah. But I am an adult and will think of this as Child's Play rip, an adventure bashing nonsense and a lame Tales From The Crypt episode, or trying to be at least one, with a lame ending that was stupid and it had Many plot holes, and I still can't understand how it came to life. Was it an evil Geppetto's work? So what, after a few evil deeds, does he become a real boy who becomes America's most wanted? Personally, I think the concept of an evil Geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wood murders and starts a crime wave, fun. But this is terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible! TERRIBLE! Smelly like a shoe and awful! IT SUCKED IT SUCCESSFUL! If you want killer dolls, settle for the killer doll, especially Child's Play, instead of tightening. Or if you want a fairy tale face upside down, see Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, see the animated Disnet version or live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau instead. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
