This one was really awful. Looking at fascinated horror, I continued to ask "why have they done this?" It's taken all the scenarios out of "The Day After Tomorrow", "The Perfect Storm" and "Twister" and remixes them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by television director Dick Lowry, for a long time, with every disaster film clich√© known for man and not an ounce of real excitement. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians, and movie films were made in Canada, Winnepeg doubled to Chicago, so no doubt tax relief had something to do with it. Although some ambitious special effects were attempted, the performance is so poor that a decent spectacle is not achieved. The actors can be a competent party; The script is so bad that no one had a chance to show it, except perhaps for Randy Quaid as Tommy Tornado Chaser, who went just over the top and was totally entertaining. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, manufacturers have since made another of these Canadian disasters turkeys called "Category 7" End of the World ", which was very tastefully shown at CBS in the United States a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina How could the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do such a thing? In prime time? The PT Barnum "no one was ever broken underestimates public taste" has proven to be real once more.
