Oh how I laughed ... this has it all ... an Asian / white family, a handicapped Asian boy ... all that a healthy person needs to see in the BBC's eyes. <br /> <br /> What a whole tribe: This was a total insult to my eyes that saw this rubbish to an episode and only an EPISODE. <br /> <br /> When you think of some of the quality the BBC has over the years (Fawlty Towers for example) and then it comes in ... It's a disgusting disgrace. It is all geared to political correction and is without any humor. <br /> <br /> This is straight from hell in hell: but what would you expect from the ultra left BPC ... I mean the BBC.
