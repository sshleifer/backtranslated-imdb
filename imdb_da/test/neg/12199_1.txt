Action 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" is from the unfortunate postmodern theater that has declared something similar to a story or plot is prohibited. While people can get away with this on stage, it becomes mortal on film, or at least deadly boring. We are back with a bunch of good actors spitting the dialogue that, while it is excellently written, adds something. Even worse, each figure speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin using the word "isn't it." <br /> <br /> Never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the utmost, the camera's work is generally dull and (for LA residents) the attention to geography is ridiculous. (Hint: The view of Sean Penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out of his rear window, and you can't drive south through Hollywood and shut up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) Okay, suspension of disbelief and all that - and normally I would not pay attention to small things like that because they are just vagaries of production. But the fact that they stacked so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on the screen says a lot about the weakest element of this business script. In short, skip this one, even on video. Rabe picked the wrong quote from Scottish Play for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better named "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and rage, means nothing." A little long after the selection, maybe - but at least it would be honest advertising.
