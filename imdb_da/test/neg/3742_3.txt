This movie had a couple of fun parts, but for the most part I wanted to go ahead and change DVD's and see "Malibu's" instead of what I had in my own collection. At least I wanted to know there was something fun to come up to and give me something to look forward to. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget film. And I don't judge a movie with that budget. It lacked only originality and was too predictable. I wouldn't rent or even watch this movie again, and I'm usually a repetitive offender of movies. The actors were forgettable. The story was half thought out, and it left me with an insatiable urge to get my laugh on. I ended up seeing Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangsta to get the comedy itch scratched.
