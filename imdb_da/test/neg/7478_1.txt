For a while when I was an intermediate job, I had a habit of seeing all the late night talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached 1.30. The time between Conan and X-Files, on SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and still is) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show fascinated me first. Young, casually dressed, and with hip-pedigree from an MTV host, I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. I couldn't have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> He has no comic timing. His jokes are clearly unfunny, and his monologue is a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. I began to think that he was simply not able to deliver comedy (and I'm right, he is not), but it became clear in time that the authors on the show must have had it to him. The script was idiotic and much too overreaching and the sketches frighteningly bad. And at the end of the show, the studio had authors Carson drinking alcohol on the set of gusto on each show, a creepy Carson shining from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek when he slammed himself through interviews. <br /> Zero interview skills. None. He tries to be kind / chatty, but ends up being boorish and rude. He speaks too much. He cut off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - if he can find a question to ask them at all. And as one person had already pointed out, the guests literally stared at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable. Now the show has left the studio and looks like it was shot on a handy cam. Still, Carson refuses to take hints from NBC. At one point, Carson didn't even get a camera man, he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... that handwriting is over the wall. <br /> <br /> I see the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that this is why it is still in the air, he pays it himself.
