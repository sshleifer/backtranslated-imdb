This movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes. I don't know what everyone else smoked called this a beautiful movie. I feel that a couple of hours in my life were stolen from me and I want them back. I would put this in the category of a battlefield land. Yes people are so bad. You would as well watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over again, it would have the same effect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
