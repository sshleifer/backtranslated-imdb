This (supposedly) based TV movie is a woman on the way from the FBI and a * seriously stupid guy. First we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson) a "regular guy" type with a mindless job, a former wife, a child he hardly ever sees and some cats. <br /> <br /> Next, there is "Elaine-Lisa-you called it" (Tracy Pollan), a smart, sexy and handsome woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she had ever told the truth. Roger and Lisa meet when she answers a lonely heart announcement. Roger is one of those poor saps who can't seem to handle living alone, so after his wife dumped him, he places his ad. It doesn't take long for Roger to figure out that Lisa is * not * a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her. He doesn't even have enough to change the lock on his apartment door when he throws her out. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and see it here if you have nothing else to do. <br /> <br />
