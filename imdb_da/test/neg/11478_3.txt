I watched this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988, and even though I knew it was not an award winning caliber ... I liked it. It tells the story of 5 former cub scouts reunion to take the only task they never got to finish as children - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course, the cub scouts are all adults and have developed their personalities in a number of ways, but none too different from what they were like children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still one of the group's dear Abby, and Tim Thomerson is still the group's superior. Of course, the top image star Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in all, is Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with his mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for another great adventure in Scouting. However, comparing their task is the Grunski brothers, two waves drummed out of the Cub Scouts of the above. Randomly they run into their old cave and decide to harass them a little, though harmless. Not so innocent are three escaped prisoners who believe Pack 7 is from the FBI and intend to exterminate them. All in all, the film still has a bit of charm. Be aware that Richard Lewis is trying to be comfortable on a folded cot, for example, and you have a great fun to go to. After further review, the whole film needed more of that kind of observation humor. It doesn't last well after all these years, but is still a guilty pleasure.
