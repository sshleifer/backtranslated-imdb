I'm glad this was the last of '40's Universal Mummy movie. The film was all varying in quality, and this film was certainly one of the smaller ones. The problem is that it is a very slow moving movie where essentially nothing interesting or exciting ever happens. Maybe it would have been better if the mummy had made its entrance earlier in the film. Instead, the film once again uses its first 20 minutes to explain what had happened in the previous mummy movies, and again to use archive film from this time "The Mummy" from 1932, this film being the fourth mummy movie that follows 1932 -mummie history. The movie just never finds the right pace, and even though the film hardly exceeds an hour, it still feels a bit like a move. Of course it does not help that the film has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story. The film also feels completely different. The first and second half of the film are not really connected to each other, and they appeared as two separate films on their own. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr. still in it. He once again represents the role of Mom Kharis for the third time. Too bad he has such limited screen time this time. Unfortunately, he becomes very little interesting to do, which is also a huge waste of the mummy character himself. The film is further filled with dozens of stupid actors playing with stupid accents. It seemed so completely unnecessary for me that most of the characters should speak with such accent and it actually becomes quite distracting and annoying at points. <br /> <br /> Mummy films are worth the least. <br /> <br /> 4/10
