Dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema. From go-go, I assumed I was in something pretty ugly. With a cast line up that featured Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister, what could one expect? Well, let's just say that expectations were broken ... <br /> <br /> If I really start, I feel this review will continue for years, so we'll keep it simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The crew carries coffins from the carpathian sector of the Transylvania system. In his big scene, Coolio talks about the most horrible things ever mentioned in film history. In the year 3000, all bad clothes carry today's standards, they have nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair, and they embellish with neon lights that appear stolen from a runway. <br /> <br /> To top it all off ... the end. Sweet merciful God. It does not deserve to be destroyed. It must be late to be believed. I rated this movie a "1" and I wish I could give it a zero ... but I feel compelled to make you see it. What madness is this?
