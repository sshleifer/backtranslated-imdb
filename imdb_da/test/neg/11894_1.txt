This must be the most boring movie I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say about it is thankfully I didn't pay to see it. We got a free show at school and everyone in the audience just sat embarrassed and wondered when the fun would start. This piece of junk is a badly filmed, far too long movie. The real idea of ​​why the movie took about 10 seconds to present. The only ones who may be interested in this movie are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They may find some of the interviews interesting. Another editing may have made an interesting documentary for this, but I doubt that the interviews shown were not involved in any way. As it is, it's just a tragedy, both to see and be a part of. AVOID THIS MOVIE ON ALL COSTS!
