This is really awful, the feebest attempt on a cartoon adaptation ever committed to movies. All sorts of things about this movie that could be bad are. Music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects ... about the only positive things I can find is that Sue looks cute in her blue tights and that Thing makeup is almost acceptable (face only). That is it. Zip. Don't track the bootleg copy; It really is not worth your time. Even the interrupted "Captain America" ​​movie from the early 90s is far less rude than squirming in your seat while trying to endure this mess.
