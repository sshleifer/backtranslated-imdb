One of the many silent comedies Stan Laurel highlighted before joining Oliver Hardy, 'Mud and Sand' is a ho-ho hokum. The story is very uneven - though it could be because of the modern editing - and humor itself is not inventive at all. Potential plotlines are started and ignored; For example, Stan's promise to make Fillet de Sole pay for what she's done with him never comes true. Stan's character also doesn't seem very centered, but it's a common criticism of his work before he developed 'Stanley' by Laurel & Hardy fame, so I might just wait to see this shortage. <br /> <br /> I strongly believe that all the silent movies must be preserved and viewed, and I am glad that this is still available. It's just not a good movie.
