I guess I should now comment on a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; The successors otherwise surprise or surprise me by their sleaze and conscious _absurdism. Do they constitute or fall into a fourth way? Not classic, not revisionist, not European ??, but a sleaze Americana, related to the violent vigilant '70s movie, the absurd garbage. This episode is also bombastic sleaze ?? inexplicably awkward and even a little strange. <br /> <br /> Now, what I find disturbing is that these successors not only have their opportunistic fans; But the fans simply do not notice any difference between the original style and the successors. <br /> <br /> These sequels are not boring or insipid ?? but weird. Of course they are very poorly written ?? messy scripts, rubbish lines. It's just crazy; at this rate, every gunman gets more women ?? Van Cleef's young wife asks him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. The young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps his wife, rapes and kills her, then goes along with a misdemeanor. Van Cleef, who has previously refused to help defend a village, now collects a small bunch and charges the hacienda of the cover; then take over the misdemeanors of the village where Van Cleef has sat. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, who is quite active in the 70s, turned Western, is Van Cleef's treasure. Callan, very antipathetic, is Noah, an author and Chris's sidekick. The rest of the aggressive bunch is Askew (one of the only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really hot, cool beauty.
