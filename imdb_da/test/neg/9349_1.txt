I like the Star Wars series. I like a good, cheapo sci-fi flick every time too. Heck, I even like Roger Corman-produced nickel-and-dime jobs. <br /> <br /> I don't like "Ice Pirates", though. <br /> <br /> It just looks cheap, you know? For a movie to take place in outer space, it feels cramped and shut in as if being filmed in front of a person's Mazda. And the special effects, while appropriately cheesy, look more than anything like foam-painted metal gray. <br /> <br /> Normally, I don't like things, especially if the story and the characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> It's not all. <br /> <br /> The whole story of these ne'er-do-well space pirates who decide to find a planet filled with ice can melt and sell like water (a hot commodity in the future, I think ) is as original as the jokes, which is not a compliment. The mood comes in at about step level (as the castrating machine you want to see early on), and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? The one who did it was ashamed of them. Good old Robert Urich is trying, but he is a reliable actor aboard a poorly sinking ship (or star ship, in this case). <br /> <br /> I saw this about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time - shanghaied. <br /> <br /> No stars. Despite Huston's presence (a year before "Prizzi's Honor") and Carradine (at the end of a once-high career), these "Pirates" should go on the plank.
