I rented a copy of this from Netflix - big mistake. The DVD edition titled "The One-Armed Swordsmen" was produced by the madmen who believed that the battle sequences would be appreciated, better glued together in a large chapter than as part of a consistent sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters that you can choose from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked to see Wang Yu in his prime again after all these years, this is a complete waste of time. I have had detergents that made a better movie than this. What the chopped DVD version shows us is that it doesn't matter how stupid a Chinese script can be. One has to see a kind of story to worry about how the battle sequences show up. <br /> <br /> But "The One-Armed Swordsmen" gives you the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh look up smirking pretty boy David Chiang - it's always a pleasure to see that happening. Lo plays a kind of second-string villain here and serves as a good example of why some people really need orthodontists. he film is also characterized by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as the magistrate. <br /> <br /> Another comment above mentions the mandatory battle-in-the-in scene (which is actually two) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a series of comic barbarians using what resembles cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee sound while fighting. None of this makes sense, but it's okay if you don't expect any clarity or common sense. It was fun to see anyway. <br /> <br /> Another feature of this production is that there are no significant female characters. There are a few female roles, but they do not play a serious role in the action or plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one explaining why he only has one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.
