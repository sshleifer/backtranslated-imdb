With NBC's "Thank God You're Here", the network can try to replicate the successes of ABC's improv-sitcom, "Who's Line Is It Anyway?" in which host Drew Carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some sort. In the NBC show, Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier monitor a handful of remarkable comedians who will improvise through various scenes, all of which begin with "Thank You, You're Here." It takes far too seriously (why should the viewers repeatedly recall that the actors have never seen the sets before), both hosts seem less than enthusiastic. Having watched the regular pair, did not try to play the actors, but I wonder if the live audience really laughs at what is happening or whether they are improvising as well. Expect this time slot filler to be a very short term.
