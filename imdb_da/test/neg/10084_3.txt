Tyra & the rest of the modeling world have to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous models of selling anything. Weird places, too much makeup and too much skin are not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you sell to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they must have it on the show. My daughter has a 36 "inseam, is tall and slim and a size 5, I'm more average in size 12. We would like to see both - I can't see how anything would look at me when a size 2 wears it, It doesn't fit me the same way, I don't buy magazines anymore because they are one-sided in this case, we really want to love the show to consider women of all sizes.
