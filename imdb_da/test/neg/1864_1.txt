This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can't believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the pursuit of "ghoulies" masks. They are OBVIOUSLY Halloween masks! The mouths don't even move when they talk !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comical and goofy? When they do something, there seems to be this circus-like music and used BONK and BOING sounds when they hit people. Bondage dominatrix lady is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. This movie is just bad. The reason is non-existent. The mother from ONE TREE HILL is in this though, and she has of course had a nose job since it was made. Why did the protagonist return from the first movie to do this garbage? BATHING BATH BATH FILM.
