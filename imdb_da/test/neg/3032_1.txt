Words almost fail to describe how terrible this Irish vanity project (funded by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Albertan) is. <br /> <br /> There is a sudden appearance of a beautiful-looking Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim) who in real life was a star athlete in Alberta, for no other reason to secure Canadian content. Credits also indicate that some Calgary pubs were helpful. <br /> <br /> Everything here is badly filmed and at least third hand (lumps of poorly digested Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious steals). Avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of the campy "so bad it's almost fun" nights in front of your telly.
