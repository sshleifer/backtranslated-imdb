I'm sorry, but I don't understand how the studio gets away with this. The movie is just not worth it. Maybe as a theater game, but certainly not like a movie! And why do they call it a thriller ??? The offcource action is good, but I do not expect anything less from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as the soft "bad guy". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) look beautiful to me;). I am also a fan of his British detectives. Still, they just can't save this ow so boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope we no longer come to many films from this director "Pieter Jan Brugge", because of course he does not understand the meaning of the words "suspension and thriller".
