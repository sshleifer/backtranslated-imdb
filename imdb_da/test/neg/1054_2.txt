This is your typical Junk comedy. <br /> <br /> There are almost no laughs. No real moments. No memorable lines. No scenes where you think of yourself, "it was wise". Nothing. The reason is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> It is ugly to look at and boring as hell! There is no substance here. This movie has nothing. It doesn't matter if Farely was in this or not. A crap movie is a crap movie, no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> Also, David Spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same miserable character in ever movie / TV show that he is in. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead upon arrival . There is no life here. Not funny. No intelligence. There are lots of other "stupid" comedies more enjoyable to this one. This movie is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
