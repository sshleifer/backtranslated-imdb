"A young man, recently committed to getting married, is a victim of a traffic accident and dies as a result of his injuries. His father, desperate to revive his son, agrees to let a scientist test his experimental soul-migration process for After the young man returns to life, his father and fiance discover a dark and violent change in the behavior of the young, which makes them believe that something went awfully wrong in the re-emergence process, "according to the DVD's synopsis . <br /> <br /> At one point, Edward Norris (like Philip Bennett) is asked, "What do you think it is, Boys Town?" Mr. Norris should know when he was in "Boys Town". "The Man with Two Lives" is more like "Black Friday" minus Karloff and Lugosi. You do the math. This movie may have been a contender, with a recycled script; It has an exciting final action. After a lukewarm "shoot out", hung out for the drama to fetch a successful scene between the star Norris and the persecution of detective Addison Richards (like George Bradley). <br /> <br /> **** The Man with Two Lives (1942) Phil Rosen ~ Edward Norris, Eleanor Lawson, Addison Richards
