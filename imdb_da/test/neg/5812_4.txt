Hedy Lamarr, who may have been held by more men on the screen than any other actress, is again the celebrated mistress of Kent Taylor, community play and generally around rat. On a boat from Yucatan after Taylor has given her the brush she tries suicide. But Doctor Spencer Tracy rescues her from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is the medical guy. I think he never heard the word specialist. He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor, and his turn was a sideline to medical research. Lamarr and he married and she is trying to introduce him to his world, and he even becomes a partner of community physician Louis Calhern. Of course, Kent Taylor responds to the picture and Hollywood is inevitable. <br /> <br /> When I see this woman, it seemed to me that the authors were heavily influenced by Tracy's Oscar-winning Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role as Dr. Karl Decker is not a patch on what he did as Father Flanagan. Maybe they tried to give Father Flanagan a little romance in his life in this movie to say. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Lamarr didn't get along well. In fact, this movie was dubbed I resume this woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg walked away from the movie, presumably because Lamarr did not work for him as Marlene Dietrich did. She did Lady of the Tropics and then MGM went back to filming this with their contract director Woody Van Dyke, who was known for the speed of his productions. And a whole new supporter was brought in. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles for both.
