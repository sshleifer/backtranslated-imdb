In this movie, there is a loose man (Bardem) who wants to get funding for his construction industry, and marries a woman he doesn't love (the broad eyes of Maria de Medieros) in the process. He maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and eventually becomes rooted in his own romantic web. He never gives his juggling until the three main characters come face to face. The movie is boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the movie are absurd, incoherent and of course too stupid. None of the characters are credible, which makes the movie a little annoying. Still, the play is surprisingly good for such a poorly directed movie, which makes it a bit interesting, but if you can, watch another movie, thank you!
