This movie sucks so badly. It's fun to see what's a bad story where two pea-brained American twins who know nothing about their school can come to another continent and do incredible things there. It's just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French guys, turn on them and finally kiss them, don't know anything about them? More realistic would have had the boys take them away and rape them, which could have been easily done in such a situation. As for the bit where they get the French president to drink 'bad water', it was just lamb. I don't think he would have been too happy in real life. Everything worked too easily for the girls, and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie, if it depicted real life at all. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
