This is quite typical of the Sci-Fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and horrible special effects. We have some foreign socks loose on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what he gets to perform a performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is completely dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored clich√© to first like Lou, of course, comes to love him again at the end. The unpleasant state senator who gets munched early on and a gaggle of boring security guards running around a lot. Then there is an ecotourist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason except to give us 3% more to run around. He spends the whole middle of the film hiding in a box. <br /> <br /> The special effects deserve their own section. We start with a meteorite flying through the air, then flame behind it for about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the specified speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction can cause you to burst into fire. Then it lands on a hood that enters horizontally. A kind of velcro ball that lands on a velcro floor, I think. It doesn't really damage the car much, just bend the head a little up. Later, Lou arrives in a helicopter and chases after the train. Although the train only had a two minute start, it takes a good half hour to catch it. CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen as believed. It seems that they took a jar of petrol and threw it against a wall and overlaid the flame effect over the helicopter. Ca. 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter could not pull up in time, it carried five tons of nitroglycerin. Then, the eco-terrorist blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions as most explosions do, he explodes upward like a gun directed at the air. Then it's all about not being able to stop the train because it would let the little foreigners get away, but it seems that aliens can actually fly faster than the train is driving, so why it would keep them on the train you have no idea. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you have a couple of hours that absolutely need to kill and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network, come and think about it, some of the chefs are kind of cute. Usually these films have at least one or two things about those that allow them to sit through them; Maybe there is a sexy girl, some T&A, or a character who actually has some personality, or some excitement or something. I really didn't see anything here.
