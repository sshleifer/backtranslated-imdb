Reports of the movie's brilliance seem to have been greatly exaggerated, and unless the other reviewers saw another movie, I fail to see how anyone can find this movie anything but boring, unclear, creepy, slow, and sometimes scary annoying. I'm not a schocky horror fanatic. I love j-horror and Euro-horror over American horrors one day, but I feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this movie before investing two hours in their lives in it. <br /> <br /> It could have been so great. A reporter examines a number of bizarre deaths and appearances that are apparently unconnected, but a number of unpleasant troops seem to connect them - dead pigeons, teasing sounds, the presence of strangely knotted nodes ... Our reporter goes from person to person person, interview them, film them and then move on. Three important characters are among these people, a young, shy mental girl, an extremely annoying, insane mental man and a crazy old woman and her boy whose meaning is not revealed until later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is not even extremely interesting, making its two-hour running time unforgivable. It is not even distant or scary. Probably scary scenes like shot of ghoulish faces are made incredibly bad, shown twice or worse, we are told when they are about to happen. Other techniques, such as telling us that a family just interviewed "died five days later" simply doesn't care, let alone mildly scared. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a bit to the end, as our journalist, cameraman, psychic and damned woman goes to a village to "remove" the curse that links all these deaths. However, I was in a state of catatonic boredom, and could not care less so all that scary camera work and shock was wasted on me. The last band is quite good, but once again I have quit being caring and just wanted this movie to end. <br /> <br /> Drilling and boring, not scary and not scary, I would advise you to stay away from Noroi. It has promising moments, but it's a movie that was made and not worth your time.
