I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was quite disappointing as a sequel. First of all, Travolta in no way resembles Chili Palmer from Get Shorty. He only halved this achievement as he has done in all his recent films. He is not at all smooth or has mobster presence around him that makes you a little mess for him throughout the film. It seems that Travolta rolled out of bed and decided he was good at going to acting in this movie. The plot was just not exciting or wise, there are really no highlights that happened, the only thing that looked like entertainment was watching Christina Millian perform and The Rock was fun. But anyway, long story short, this movie was trash, and I had to force myself just to get through it.
