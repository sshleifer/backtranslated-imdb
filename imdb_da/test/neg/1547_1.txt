I bought this movie in a garage sale when I was like 15. I then hated it and looked at it again, just for hell of it, it's even worse now. You can hear the instructor and the cameraman in the background shouting commands like "Zoom, Zoom, Zoom !!!". They are no special effects, just a raw piece of meat that should be a brain. This is totally crap, and I originally thought it was a kind of home movie or something I bought. But this was distributed elsewhere, and it's just really strange to know that others have seen it. Whoops I need 10 lines .... Well .... it can be an interesting thing to see to see how no budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. This sucks. In fact, yes, look at this just to see if you can sit through the worst. If you can do this, you can do it through something.
