I watched some of this on television once, and when a friend recommended it, I began to look for it, even though it didn't seem to be anywhere near it. I finally got it in an antique shop and couldn't wait to see it ... Oh, I had seen it a few years earlier and could really have had it. I was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long, and I think that's what made the plot and story so lacking. The plot really sounds like a good one, both on the trailer and the film commentaries: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his new found, stray lab Gul is marooned on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison). Together they can survive the desert and wait to be found and rescued. But what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events in the plot are very hasty. There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown together for more than a moment. Gul is a rude dog, the parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to participate in a boat trip. The mother's scene (Mimi Rogers) vaguely mentions what death is like the younger boy (Joel Palmer) who does not go anywhere. In no time do we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island, then suddenly it is 14 and then 19. Of all the animals a castaway can be exposed in nature, only 1 kind - a wolf - attacks them. Why couldn't anything else have been a problem instead of having the same kind of animal - maybe even the same - beating twice? There are few views on how Angus prepares food, except when he discovers fruit and roots, and when he roasts a caught rat. If he knows so much about survival skills, why didn't there be more scenes with that? The only thing that made me empty was why the dog didn't have much part alone. When he is rescued and the dog is left on the island, there is no scene showing how he survives without human help. I wished I was more open to this when I looked at it, but I enjoyed some of this. The action was good and the score was comfortable. Although I was wondering why the father looked so much older than his family, and why he and the biggest seeker and rescue director share names. This is a good movie for children, but even though the protagonist is 14, no one over 10 will be interested in this.
