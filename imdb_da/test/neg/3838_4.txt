I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better movie. It had some interesting phrases, but some seemed meaningless. When a background appears on the two main characters, some of it really seemed to go wrong. Most of it was kind of useless and didn't help the movie at all. It wasn't Dennis Hopper's finest hour either. However, the greatest saving grace of this movie was for me Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, he does almost Mr. Blonde for a good guy. All in all, it was visible. I was still back, thinking that some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.
