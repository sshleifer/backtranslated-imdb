Fran√ßois Traffaut's "Mississippi Siren" had a compelling plot. The manuscript required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief. The ground went into a glacial pace. It started in an interesting setting, but quickly entered the melodrama schools that lacked logic or intelligence. What did the critics think of? This is overestimated even to be described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who charmed in "The Parrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", managed to be simply annoying. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie while renting another Traffaut movie. We first looked at this and found it so bad that we sent the other back invisible at the same time.
