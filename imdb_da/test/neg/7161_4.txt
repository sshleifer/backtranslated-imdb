After the book I became very sad when I saw the movie. I agree that sometimes a movie must be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) why the rows are different (eg Lt. Diestl instead of Sergeant etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) The last screen is very bad and makes Diestl as a soldier who breeds himself and wants to die. But that's not true in 100%. Just read the book. He was also a bull dog in the last few seconds. He did not want to die by destroying his gun and simply went to Michael & Noah. <br /> <br /> So this is a kind of a happy end that doesn't even fit this movie.
