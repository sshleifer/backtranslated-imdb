This movie is such a waste of talented people and Hollywood budget. It made me think that everyone in the movie paid a favor by being in it because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible garbage bin of a movie. It's a constructed plot that is just pathetic, unrealistic and not even close to fun or interesting. The only thing that kept my interest was the many big names in the movie that stopped appearing without apparent reason and who had no acting or good lines to contribute to a movie's mess. I expect to have some good things, since all these people were cool in other movies. But it never came through. This film should appear in prison as a punishment, but it would be cruel and unusual. You will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parading around such a terribly pathetic flat-line script and terribly bad acting. This movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with many recognizable faces BIG PROBLEM (2002), which also went out of the readable scale on suck-o-meters.
