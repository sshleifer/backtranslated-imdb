I really wanted to like this movie, but pacing was just too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a lovely story, but it was really like seeing a slug race. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been better served if it had some more actions. I mean nothing big, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It could also have been helped by songs that set the tone / mood for the longer periods of non-dialogue. It's been about 10 years since I've seen it, so I might have to give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
