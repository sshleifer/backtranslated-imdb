I took my 14 year old to watch this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was horrible! This movie should at least be judged R. I'm not so strict with movies, but it was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy, and I knew that the comedy would probably be raw, but it was far more harmless. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I couldn't believe how scary it was. I couldn't believe it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and view this content. I don't understand how the rating system works. ??
