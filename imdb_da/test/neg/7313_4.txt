The credits at the end read "ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya". It's an appropriate way to put it on because it looks like filmed material from several projects was thrown together somehow, barely trying to make it all a uniform work. It felt more like one of those music clip stuffs that are marketed as feature films to deposit on these video advertisements, just that here we have the transferable music and live performances missing, except for a scene that may as well be marketed as a strange music video clip in Japan. Whatever. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense. Visually, even though it has its moments (for example, the female being with the "death powder" attached to a bedbase and some morphing all the way through) it is not very special, and it certainly has an industrial feel to it. Normally, I would call the effects dilettantish, but what this film offers in this regard is amazing more than anything else. Do you remember the cheap video effects of the 70s and 80s music videos that make them look as dated as a picture in a picture flying through the screen? There are quite a few of these kinds of effects in this and for no apparent reason. The most half-assed apparent effort comes in the form of a picture collage. The pictures look like album art. No matter what. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happens to the subtitles in the version I saw. The Chinese (or whatever are these hieroglyphs) sometimes appear when nothing is said and the English often occur without the Chinese. The English subgroups talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?), And a mind without a body that gives what comes closest to an understandable conflict between characters in this movie. A guy (a scientist) says that life without meat is death while another guy (a metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is over his body now that he got the "death powder" blown into his face and that He now knows the secrets of the flesh and what not metamorphosing dude is visibly devoted to the scientist's demands. No matter what. <br /> <br /> Erm, the End - Everything written by Perception the ambiguity
