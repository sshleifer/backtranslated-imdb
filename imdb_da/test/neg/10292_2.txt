Essential Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick, disturbing movie ... like the sick, winding director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It's not the blame for the actors for sure. The piece probably exhibited their roles well. That's the way this movie was written and how the characters were written, which was a benchmark for a really sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I will never see any other movie written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick, distorted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. She looks, talks and sounds like a bikerchick with her brain fried on drugs that spent 20 years on hard time. You can clearly see what kind of person she is seeing her on the DVD special feature of "Surveillance: The Watched Watching." You can see and hear her herself. She was as bad as I had imagined by writing this movie. I'm not shocked by bad language, even though this instructor certainly speaks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any movie. The level of implied Sado violence and Perversion she incorporates into every character she writes is of the genre, which is even illegal by p0rn standards. This perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly evident in her own personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. This is a snus movie. <br /> <br /> Be sure to listen to her story about the deleted scenes and alternative ending. This director / writer is really a sick person. I can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, much less pay her for it. You can be sure I will never see any other movie she's been affiliated with. In the thousands of movies I've seen and gathered, there are only a few directors and writers who deserve this kind of boycott. She's offensive to anyone I've ever seen in filming a movie before. There have been some bad instructors and writers, but no one could compare to his sick, winding mind. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, which was only a murderous ramp after another. When it came past the hotel murder ... then the sick police shot on and brutalized motorists to kick ... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business in children) ... followed by drug addicts .... the movie went off further to the (even more) twisted, deviating serial killers. <br /> <br /> When I saw the serial killings revealing themselves, I began to wonder what kind of real insanity wrote this movie. These were my real thoughts when I saw this movie. I was intending to find out which author had such a funny mind ... because that writer really needs to be committed to long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized that my assessment of the author was right on the nose. On the DVD she was actually the sick, winding person I had imagined writing such a disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> While the little girl, Stephanie Ryan Simpkins, really stole the show ... I can't believe her real life parents would have tolerated this sick, foul-mouthed instructor to be anywhere near their daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is disruptive, sick, offensive, twisted and the instructor's writer needs some serious mental facility treatments. <br /> <br /> As far as the end of the movie goes ... the alternative end would be the result of this horrible trial. There was no meaning and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the movie at the death of the other character. I am stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the film got the audience doing it was due to the clever word-giving and creative depiction on the trailer. This trailer is not representative of the movie you want to watch. <br /> <br /> Aside from the child ... each character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverted, violent sex freak, and their characters reflected the author's director who created them. But if you look carefully, even the family members' parents; the sick police take pot shots; serial killings are in alternative roles; the police in the station; and even the station dispatcher ... every one of these character roles incorporated a sexual, twisted, violent pervert. I'm not sure if any of the actors after watching them talk about the movie of the movie and the Canadian city in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Whatever her writing, this author director has such a personal mental deviation, each character role contains the same carbon copy stamps. The only sign that did not have these deviant trends was the child. Look carefully and you will see this in every character. So listen to the director-author's talk on the DVD Special Features section, and you'll understand what I'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. She wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she wasn't from a Hollywood movie-making family. Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch doesn't have much filmography ... less than a handful of things. As she carbon copies these disturbing features in all her character roles, I don't think we should see many movies written or directed by her unless her father, director David Lynch, helps her out. I would recommend staying away from any movie she's involved in ... and I'm not sure her dad's movie would be better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid everything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
