Separate single mother in the picturesque seaside resort finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur action, its sleeping love life. Pet project for actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw, which gives a warm and nicely modulated lead performance, but this story is so slim and the direction and editing are so irregular that a slight dissatisfaction creeps in. Originally, Capshaw's Helen sees several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke), but the first person they do with this is Ellen DeGeneres who doesn't play a lesbian, but who comes out as one because of this gimmick. Various ideas are flayed in the hope that one would hold onto, and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly work with his shirt off) is very good, but they can't save the final action, which is disappointing. Low-keyed, in a quirky, comfortable way, but it's gently good-natured, nothing more. ** 1/2 from ****
