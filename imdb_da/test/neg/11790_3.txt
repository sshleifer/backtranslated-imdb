I'm sure every legitimate submarine would like to broadcast on USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...) Why can you play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so big. And how 'in the windows of the bay, the better there is to see giant waves or minefields that look like nothing? Did I mention the colorful root cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the admiral's bathroom with what seems to be a loft? Big bleeding part ... OK, OK ... it will never win any prizes for authenticity. And if the bottom is ridiculous, the plot is even worse. Somehow, the Van Allen belts of radiation, hundreds of miles in space, have "set fire" to make global warming look like a weenie roast. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon), along with his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre, looks appropriately uncomfortable) hatching a scheme to extinguish the fire by shooting a missile into the middle. <br /> <br /> There are lots of intrigues (sic) along the way, with a survivor (and his little dog too!) two "ladies" who can never rely well enough, a passel of "red shirts" which are consumable and plot holes large enough for Godzilla to go through. Thrill to Seaview is being hunted for what looks like 60 miles an hour from another sub - no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet of astern. <br /> <br /> The movie carries from one cliff hanger to another; The payoff is so anticlimatic to be meaningless, certainly not worth 1 hour and 50 minutes of waiting. The technical adviser to this shipwreck must have been a 14-year-old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines. Worth to see if you only want to riff.
