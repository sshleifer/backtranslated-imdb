I had chosen either over this movie. This movie has been in my "must see" list for a while because people talked about it being "disturbing" and also the VHS box contains many and many quotes from people who say how "amazing" it is. or how "as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre" and lines like that. But sorry people, I was disappointed with time. The idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes an erroneous evolutionary evolution, and people actually make the stupid movie in the movie. It again takes its credibility that the reason may have otherwise. I couldn't believe how unnecessarily loooooong some "where is he, let's find him" sequences were. A few gory moments to please make a fan, but they are so few that when we get to them there is no point. If Luther is a geek, then the filmmakers must really be down the food chain.
