After September 11 in New York, this drama of American firefighters was perceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has crashed through a burning building's floor and communicates only with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) via the radio. Flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruiter, seeing Kennedy as a grandfather, to be a fire house legend. Of course, Jack's firefighters today are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and finally he lets them leave him and it goes on to his funeral where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known. Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The movie's flames are ultimately everything I could pay attention to and enjoy watching the characters tackle them, the rest is a little too chatty to my liking. Sufficient!
