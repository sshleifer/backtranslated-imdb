This is the most graceful excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I'm worried that this guy got his own show. It smells of complete and complete desperation from the comedy center trying to fill the cavity of the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. He's a tip from Ned's comedy gold bag: Is a punchline not fun? Need to give it extra boost in hilarity? F *** NO YELL IT ON THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGER. Simple, no? And as an added bonus .... half finished your jokes with ... YOU ARE RE-TAH DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh man. So funny. Beaner ... funny. Wetback .... does the laughter ever stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, I will quote an example. Mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild new orleans because it is so close to the water. Geni. The distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been so clearly drawn. While a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, find subtle ways to weave a joke in something we can all laugh at and comfort in, Ned goes for the obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is it fun? Ned does not have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city, down. The Levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars ... and look! They broke. I think it's God's way of telling us that we shouldn't be there. After all, he has room in the congress. What a fool. <br /> <br /> Chapelle was a champion to turn a tired race comedian spin upside down. He was effortless on it, and at all points we were laughing at him. While mencia talks about black people who are unable to swim * yawn, * Chapelle took it 300 meters further with the black and blind white supremisist. You don't have to be scathing to be edgy. You must be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and his legions of fans are like the closed gay guy, all laughing too much at gay jokes and thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities. Except of course, with Ned, he laughs far too emphatically at "retards". You-you-duuuuh.
