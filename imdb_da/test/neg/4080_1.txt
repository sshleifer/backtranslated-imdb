Should this be fun? This is one of those movies that just doesn't work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very fun moments. This one had none. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, brilliant in Bruce Almighty, fails to deliver here. His performance is very common and he cannot carry it out as Carey did. <br /> <br /> The one good thing about this is I only paid $ 1.95 to rent it. It's a movie for kids ... very young children who have only seen about 4 movies or so in their short lives. It is interesting to note that where Jim Carey stars in a movie and they make a sequel without him it is usually a huge turkey. Someone remembers Mask's son? (IMDB Worst 100 movies all the time) Avoid this one movie lover.
