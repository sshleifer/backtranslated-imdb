Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. Put the vein $ 10 that they can't sit through this whole movie. They cannot divert their gaze or be distracted by anything. Now see your friend. Win or Loss You Get $ 10 Entertainment. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of no end when people watch a movie and are quick to give it 1 out of 10 or sum up their thoughts with "the sucked". (And when asked "Why?", They answer: "Just because." Arrgh.) Therefore, this movie exists. The only purpose is for me to say "There! This is a horrible movie! It's 1 out of 10!". <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> While the latest trend in movie parades has forced them to become more formal, this movie falls short in every aspect. It is not fun. It's not entertaining. And for some of the parodies it is completely inaccurate! Horrible play. Involuntary dialogue. An unclear story. Terrible "special effects". An INANE gag after the other. And to make matters even worse, there is not even the freedom to make it self-worthy. <br /> <br /> This movie skips idiotic, stumbles over stupid and lands face moronically. Even I, who loves a good "check your brain at the door" movie, found me physically agitated to see this. This movie is not even "Hard Ticket To Hawaii" so horrible-it is bad ... It's just bad. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I actually challenged a friend to see this as described above. Not only could he do it all the way through, but he had a headache and needed a few minutes afterwards because he felt a little sick. True story. <br /> <br /> I couldn't highlight this rating any more ... a resounding 1 out of 10!
