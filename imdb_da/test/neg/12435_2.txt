I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow I've been drawn to almost every one of his movies. Now I like independent movies, and I grew up in punk rock, and I want to say that this film is disappointing for both audiences. Not all punk songs contain "Oi!" in their crosshairs as they do in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this movie is that it changes moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. Clark has lived like his fictional stories are "how children really are" and as such you allow him ten minutes of stupid dialogue that doesn't go down, for it's the cinema's verite that he goes for. But when he shoots a ridiculous death scene (choose any of them, save for the opening operation), the over-styled attempts at what I suppose to be black, out of context, are ridiculously shot (in most cases, much worse than a student film) and completely ridiculous in relation to the story. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" do bad bedfellows, as forays in the latter style take you out of any reality to remind you to see a movie - a really really bad one.
