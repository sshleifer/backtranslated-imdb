Let me get started with a horrible story and a terrible control system. good animation but not for good graphics. that's why i give this game 4 out of 10. THIS PLAY really seems an improvement if you ask me !!! I would resume it and make this operating system better, so jaws are not so terrible to control. if i did it to improve it i would make them look better than in the movie. It will drive some crazy when you get killed so freaking easily. I played this and was killed by a diver when he had one of these flick knives in 2 hits. The dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will beg to go to the bottom of hell. This game sucks some fat ass. sorry all the cussing i think i'm done now. It's just that this game sucks so badly that it has to be taken out of the store's shelf. I dare you play the garbage and you will probably be so sour by dying so lightly so don't let it play !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
