The main problem with the 9th Company (9 Rota) is that it is not certain whether it will save private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. The experiments on Spielberg's sentimentalism are embarrassing as the burley sergeant cries in an area of ​​red flowers !!! The training sequences have no intensity or realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. Another criticism is that the Afghan warriors are called Ghosts because they hit and hardly ever see. Here they attack a Russian strong team almost in the formation without attempting to use coverage. I'm sure the tactics have gone since Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie has been seen before in other war movies and made significantly better. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: Why should all talented markers chew on a fight? Finally, I am always suspicious of a movie that starts without a story, but still needs to qualify the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no you didn't.
