It's a joke, right?! Lynch couldn't produce this as a TV show. He was out of money, so what to do? Now he has somehow received some dollars and "finished" the pilot and created this mess just by mixing everything ... How can anyone see a failed pilot for television as a cinematic masterpiece?! And now everyone guesses the deeper meaning! Well, wake up, there is none! Like in the second television series by Lynch, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a mystery and then come up with nothing. I think Lynch repeats this concept until people realize that the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian called Harpe Kerkerling. He dressed as an opera singer and "performed" some new "art songs". Singing utter nonsense like this: <br /> <br /> "The Wolf. The Lamb. On the Meadow. Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he subsequently discussed it with the audience. And they seriously talked about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> You people who give this movie a rating of 8.0 in imdb.com, you can be one of them. <br /> <br /> Let's say it all, "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> Macaulay J.
