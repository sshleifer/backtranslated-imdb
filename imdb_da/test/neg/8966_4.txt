**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Mountain Hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. "Going at 18" she begins to attract male attention and responds by throwing stones. The arrival of a dam building construction triggers dreams of romance in Mrs Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of independent engineer Robert Young (like John Stafford), who flirtingly conceals his marital status. Supervisor Ralph Bellamy (like George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for various reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn worships. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn uses the power of prayers to heal a child, neighborhood people think she is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't so serious, "Spitfire" could be more entertaining; It is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, which is thoroughly convincing. Of the leaders, Mr. Bellamy the best. However, the best characterization has arisen from Sarah Haden (like Etta Dawson), who appeared in George Cukor's stage version along with Louis Mason (like Bill Grayson). Will Geer (like West Fry), "Grandfather Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected end helps.
