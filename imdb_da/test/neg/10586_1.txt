It's not unusual that Hollywood likes to pump out crappy movies. Occasionally, a handful of good movies come out of them, while the majority just suck big ass. It is also not surprising that these bad movies are retreaded by old TV shows'. Occasionally, a surprise pops up with "The Fugitive" (which saw the best picture oscar nom comes?), But for every "fugitive" there is a McHale's Navy or another totally non-original movie for no reason or interest. Against Squad, in my opinion, goes into my top ten of really miserable movies where Hollywood should get it sorry, it's beaten to produce what could have been a good movie. We are shifting dab smack in the middle of a story that just doesn't make sense, it wastes the talent, and the dialogue is just bad. We don't actually know who the hell these characters are, and we could give a flying f ** k what they are. Instead, you are automatically expected to know who they are and what to do. There is a particularly bad riff about "I'm too old for this s ** t" line, it's simply stupid. Something my friend verbally noticed when we were clamoring for the movie to just the end. It's just an insult to the Hollywood cinema. Degree: F-
