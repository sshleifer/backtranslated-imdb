Although this film (and I use the term solved) was made in 1997, we have just seen it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we had never heard of made him a little worried. Still, I watched, sure that if Jones was in the movie, it should be worth at least two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our go-to actors for years. Moreover, although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was reassured by seeing another familiar face. The list of performed actors / actresses continued to grow, so I endured more and more of this movie, sure that if I pushed enough clich√©s and trite social statements, I would be victorious on the other side of the plot. Alas, there was no plot. It seemed to be burned by the eternal lava of death. <br /> <br /> The characters were paper thin. The reason was so shock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and worked in the movie. Was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (like sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no drowsy ash ... no skin-cutting heat just a few meters from the lava. Wow ... it's the world's nicest lava ever! <br /> <br /> The events were no better than the characters. Every incident was so excellent and removed ... it's like the authors said, "Okay, we gotta get rid of the little girl now" ... and poof, she's sprayed by a lava bomb that burns her enough that she has that be transported to safety (not from lava, but from her own helpless stupor) ... but just moments later in the car she has no apparent pain, and shortly after, it runs effortlessly through the (moan!) building that (oh no!) is being blown up. Having continued all this is your reward line from the little boy at the end (about all the people who look the same) ... which must be one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Although the script was not so painful, it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Kid and cop aside as if the mother would still be in the area and just have to point out because she just doesn't speak up ... what ... she hopes to stand out in the shadows and get away from a little abruptly once and for all ? I do not think. Of course, her mother's mother will be missing or dying - or shouting her head to find her toddler. <br /> <br /> Token black gangsta hard hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes soft. Even if such patches existed, they would not behave as the film depicts them in the circumstances. Something about imminent burning death and massive destruction tends to catch people out of guard, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many canned movie moments like these to mention ... really, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. The poor writers ... where are they now?
