Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. She goes along with another chronicle agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and get her kidnapped niece back ... or something. Seriously - I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The movie is apparently directed by someone with severe ADD - fast camera cuts nonstop that makes it impossible to focus on anything. The dialogue is incomprehensible at times, and when you can hear it, you want it to remain incomprehensible! The act is actually quite OK, except for Ru Paul, who overcomes an embarrassing degree. Also, the movie is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just disgusting and not even extremely fun. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and just couldn't hold it anymore. I'm proud to sit through everything, but it went far beyond my limits! People compare this to John Water's early work. I disagree. Waters work is sick but good - it's just sick. Avoid.
