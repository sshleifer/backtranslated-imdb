Why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in all my fifteen years of life. I have never before witnessed such a disastrous mess like this. Absolutely everything is awkward and cheaply done. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast gives any decent performance. The dialogue is completely incoherent, and humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of it all. I can't help ringing when I remember some of his lines, like "In or Out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your lady friend is not a very good poker player. She has just revealed her hand." The raptors are a joke. Even I could do more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done. It's an insult to the actual velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. Not only that, but the killing scenes are too cruel even to me. I do not seriously think that these animals will tear their victims of tears and throw pieces over the ground just to make everything look more gory. In addition, the blood and intestines are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away. I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Perhaps the filmmakers do not expect anyone with a forging of intelligence or sensation to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on HBO late at night as I did. If I could say one thing to anyone involved in this movie, I would have to quote Dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Just try to show some respect."
