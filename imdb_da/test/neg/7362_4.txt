Look .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart hit faster as the hair on my neck started to stand up as my muscles began to tighten .. but like a strip test, I was left with no real action, no decision and money missing from my wallet. <br /> <br /> Jaume Balaguer√≥ and Miguel Tejada-Flores do not seem to know the right recipe to make a Horror Movie and as such, the old amateur chef's method of throwing everything into the pot. <br /> <br /> This movie is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser all rolled into one. Great, I know, but true. All tastes are there, you can taste each of them, they just don't mix well. I'm not going down the list of everything wrong with this movie; In short, good filmography, mediocre action, worse dialogue. The real problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into a movie, except for the resulting confusion, is that while you can have multiple plots running at a time, you cannot have multiple shots. And what does Jaume do when he runs into this problem? Like a freshman in English 101, you join your story with ellipses: "The little car disappeared in the dark and ..... EVER" Oooh, creepy. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The end left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, rent The Shining, Poltergeist and Hellraiser .. scare your pants off yourself, have a good time, and forget that the darkness ever existed. <br /> <br /> -Bamin
