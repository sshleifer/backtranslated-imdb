The great subject, director and cast somehow adds a truly immense movie, told in the flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this movie was made. (And hey, it's not a movie noir!) The flawed, overly complicated, overcrowded story has no bow, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to another without a distinction, except as a valentine to the suspected and highly questionable cooperation between the US and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me HATE this movie is when Montalban and Mitchell make a bold escape from their hunters race to presumably save Montalban's wounded partner from being murdered by a goon with a gun. operating a piece of farm machinery, Montalban says something like "quick - we must try to save him", but instead of doing so, they lie on their stomach and look in pain for about. 5 (!) Minutes on the screen when the machine carries on Murphy and finally runs him over (or we assume - the machine simply stops, another goon discovers the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots at them as they run off again.) Scene over. The whole thing is so terribly busy and totally anticlimatic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (apparently, Montalban, even though he's off for more than half of the movie) who doesn't even try. Jeez, Ricardo, do something! I know it's Anthony Mann, but hell, not all his movies are classics, people. How bad should an old movie be here to get something lower than a 6-rating?
