I watched this series out of curiosity, and wanted to see if they could and with ALL this modern technology, do Cecil B. DeMille's classic 1956 epic with Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course I was let down. Yes, they had all the biblical signs correct, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest through the first movie. If you need a mini-series, you need some "rivoting" scenes, "Burning Bush", to share "RED Sea", drowning "Pharohs Armies", "building Sethi's Pyramids", could have been done with today's technology on the scope of blockbuster movies as "Lord of the Rings" or the Matrix. It was clear that they did not want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is very much needed in these difficulties.
