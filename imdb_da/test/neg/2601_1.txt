This is the most overrated show on TV. I think people continue to see it because they feel they should because it has become something of a "cool" show to see and talk to your friends the day after work or school. it rarely evokes anything more than a chuckle and never evokes any sense of irony or thought from the audience. Each joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that seem to be pulled out of a hat. the complete lack of originality combined with the uniform lamer spin off it has spun (see: American Dad) makes me question the intellie gence of an audience that continues to hold this horrid show on television. I assign family guy no point and must God have mercy on his soul ...
