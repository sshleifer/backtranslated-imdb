There are a lot of movies, mainly from the 80s, which are so horrible that you can't help loving them. The Last Slumber Party is one of them. I hate this movie so much, but it's still one of the most watched movies in my collection. I've seen it countless times and get a big laugh out of it every time. It is the primary example of how in the 1980s any movie could be released. <br /> <br /> Our girl's name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is a blown psychopathic killer who runs around in the doctor's scrubber and a medical jacket that chops people with a scalpel as he moves on. He ends up getting over a house of girls who have a dormant party. One of the girls is the doctor's daughter who tried to operate on Randle's, and Randle ended up pulling him into some sort of sexual position. (I just have to watch the movie to know what I'm talking about.) Now I know what to think about at this point: This should be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like Slumber Party Massacre or Valentine's Day Massacre, right ? NONE! This movie is HORRIBLE! Firstly, the quality of the film changes from and to throughout the movie. Sometimes it looks like it could have been filmed this year, but other times it is so green and blurred that it can't even be seen. The funny thing is that some specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is quite ridiculous and shows that they didn't even bother. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if it wasn't funny enough) but because of the fact that he wasn't talented enough to act and control at the same time, he just filmed a shot of him who went against the camera with his scalpel and then it played the clip over and over every time someone was killed. The characters in this movie are quite ridiculous and unlikely, and these people, who suppose to be 16-18 years, look more like 25-45. I know that slasher movies often use adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie where it was quite clear. My guess is that the reason why none of them are still in the film industry today is because they are all dead in old age ... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they would never show their faces again, and that's a good thing because I very much doubt that they could have gotten into more movies, even though they tried. All I can do is hope that Tyler will one day make the last slumber party 2: the last confrontation and get all the original actors back. I'm sure everyone would love it. <br /> <br /> The movie was directed by Stephen Tyler, (No, not the singer), who never continued to rule again and was released by B&S (as I'm sure stands for bull and *** *) productions. Bull & S just released a new movie, "Forever Evil", which was pretty horrible, but not as bad as the Last Slumber Party. A horrible, horrible, horrible movie ... Highly recommended.
