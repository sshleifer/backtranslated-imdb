It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. Where are the ugly and brutal murders? Where is the excitement that should scare us? It's like watching Sesame Street without the fun characters in Ernie and Bert or Grover. It's really bad. Maybe it was writing ... maybe the direction ... may be the play, maybe editing, maybe cinematography, maybe special effects, maybe makeup. <br /> <br /> Perhaps all of the above brought this to something that could barely keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> I'd be scared ... don't get bored. <br /> <br /> It didn't scare me ... it didn't even interest me ... I had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this movie. Don't bother buying it .. and if you watch it on TV by some freak chances, there's no reason to keep the kids asleep.
