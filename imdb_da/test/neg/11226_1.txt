I think they reward idiocy today because the one who came up with the concept of this movie was not shot in sight. <br /> <br /> This is a moron's delight. The worst stereotypes of each ghetto and high school movie are drawn around and made even more unbearable. Every character in this movie has a sob history without sympathy. Let's ask for a remake where the whole school is nuked. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** How does a school go down, have the Internet in the first place?
