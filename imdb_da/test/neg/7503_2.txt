In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor), a male model agency, released a muscle blade called "Physique Pictorial" and film by men, and many of the models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. Alternative footage from the 50s, testimony to many models and Bob Mizer himself in the present, director Thom Fitzgerald used this negative pressure to show naked men and lots of penis along 93 minutes of driving time, in a completely bad taste and very stupid shit. I've never heard of this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I don't know what AMG is. In my opinion, only gay and very specific audiences like the theme of this boring and pretentious movie. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("Fresh Meat")
