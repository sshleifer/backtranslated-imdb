But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming fertilizer. Where to start. Movie quality, there is none. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The action is substandard, the gore effects are okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least on a Friday the 13th or HALLOWEEN, we mostly keep a protagonist. There are no main characters, just victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of everyone. The final survivor kills the clown and finds out that it was one of her friends. So when the police finally arrive, they do not believe in her and she is unlocked in a rubber room. What kind of end do you call it, honey, that's what. In my opinion there is no excuse for a bad end in a horror movie, it was just sloppy writing. The excuse: "It must end, it's a horror movie." or "We must end it badly to let it be open to a successor" are just lame excuses, and that's all. I must give CAMP BLOOD the THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
