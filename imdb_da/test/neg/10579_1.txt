Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Not Another Teen Movie and Another Gay Movie. Making "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in a series that easily destroyed the parody genre. Now I will admit that I have a soft spot for classics like airplanes and the naked gun, but you know you've milked a franchise so badly when you see gags a mile away. In fact, the only thing that can really force you to see this disaster is the incredibly fun but massive rental Leslie Neilson. You can tell he needs the money, show it or he intends to go down with the ship as a good capitan would. In no way does he bring this genre down, but hell he doesn't help. But if I feel sorry for someone in this movie, the decent actor Drake Bell is going through a huge amount of genes. The people who undergo the greatest amount of torture, however, are forced to sit through 90 minutes of ridiculous gall that is no more fun than herpes. After spoofing disaster movies in Airplane !, the police in The Naked Pistol and Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, David Zucker produces his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy showing everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, high school outcast Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to experience an amazing transformation. Now Rick's skin is strong as steel, and he has a strength of ten men. Determined to use his newfound forces to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly - a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe from law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) is caught amidst an experiment that has gone horribly wrong, he develops the power to pay tribute to the life force out of it. he meets and becomes the scabby hourglass. The intention of gaining immortality is to try to gather as much life force as possible, as the noble genealogy sets out to lay down his revenge and realize its fate as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and manages this low flying spoof. <br /> <br /> With Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. <br /> <br /> Hell Superhero Movie can benefit from the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility, one of the worst excursions comes from 2008 to date. Laughless but a little less annoying than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense much more forgettable than meeting the Spartans. But maybe it's a good reason. There are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that had met the Spartans from our memory. My final judgment? Avoid unless you are one of thoses people who enjoy such a crashing movie theater. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super Villain.
