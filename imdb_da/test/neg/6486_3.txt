An interesting premise and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag (side note: I will love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together, talk about healthy cheekbones!). The soundtrack was not terrible either. <br /> <br /> But the play - even those of professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon - was terrible, steering worse (perhaps contributing to the former), chimpanzee dialogue, and the camera working, barely tolerable. Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oyveve" scale. I don't know where this was filmed, but should I risk guessing, it would be either an open-air museum or one of the remodeling villages where everything is just a little too well-kept to do more than propose it " real old west ". Okay, so it was shot on a college child's budget. That said, I could have forgiven one or two of the above errors. But taking everything together and I was generous, I couldn't see giving it more than three stars.
