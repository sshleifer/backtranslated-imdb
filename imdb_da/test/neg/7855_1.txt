I accidentally came across this movie and wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually rude sequel (and something do when a man is beheaded) by a familiar children's movie. Do not take young children to see this, the title misdirected you, it has nothing to do with the original snow white except to steal it is sign. Better still don't bother going though, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see it all, the poor (compared to Disney) cartoon graphics, and no plot except on how to completely clean up a classic movie made me abandon and leave.
