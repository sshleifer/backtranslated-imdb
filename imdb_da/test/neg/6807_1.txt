In an unsuccessful attempt to be taken seriously and move into "adult" films, Mr Hughes gives us this film about a young couple. It is true that it has all the clich√©s in the book in it, silly fantasy things and all that, but more importantly, it has Elizabeth McGovern. Obviously, the best actress has ever appeared in a John Hughes movie, she emphasizes what raises sometimes stupid material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as his husband, but McGovern steals the movie with his quiet true moments of honesty. The "teenage movie" fun that worked so well in other Hughes movies fell flat here as a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but tells them when you are 15 and you want him to find some new material. But I continue to go back to McGovern's performance because it really moves. Hughes' most interesting movie for me has real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and when his material is up against a true talent, some amazing things can happen. If he just trusts it doesn't have to be tarted up with the stupid fantasy stuff.
