All I can say about this movie is it's boring. The intro to the movie may be the worst intro to a horror movie I've ever seen, I mean an angry chicken hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan is not scary at all, which is what I suppose the director was aiming for. but it was actually "mild" fun. <br /> <br /> The action in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors, if you are making a horror movie, you should hire some good actors, not a popular teenage soap star who has no idea how to act. <br /> <br /> The death scenes of this movie were far more boring. .. don't go and I'm sorry, but horror movies without gore, or good excitement are just cheesy. I think this girl is being killed by hair wrapped around her in the middle of Tokyo, and not a person sees it happen, they just declare her as "missing", wow thats awesome! Conclusion If you and your friends want to watch this movie, make sure you get some sleeping pills because I guarantee you will not make it to the end .. Me and my friend went out because we didn't even worry about what happened at the end . <br /> <br /> Bowl
