Usually, I am the one who criticizes the twenty something Neanderthal for not being able to appreciate a movie unless it has plastic teas, gunfights and car chases. However, in this case, the film may actually have been improved with a few of these additions. At least I would not have bored after an hour and switched channels. <br /> <br /> I don't mind surreal, and I certainly don't mind paying attention to finding subtle or hidden meaning, but there must be some point in it all. I did not get the feeling that even the author or director really had a broad vision of anything but instead as self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they were deliberately dispersed. Or maybe they were just confused. Either way, don't care. It bored crapet out of me for just over an hour without any savings. <br /> <br /> Although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with tense ravens about the alleged symbolism and mastery of filmography, I must disrespectfully disagree Maybe I have not cut through enough movie classes to appreciate some inspired techniques that is not visible to just mortals ... Or maybe this movie was just shit. <br /> <br /> I give it a "1" and file it for "Ishtar."
