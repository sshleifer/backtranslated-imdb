1) bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2) For a bunch of castaways on a foreign planet, it certainly looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) Horrible plot with stupid characters, making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival gear and clothing left, right and center. 4) Cool 70s scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie) <br /> <br /> 5) Interesting ship at the start (this crew member must have seen a lot of space in 1999). Too bad it blows up so early. The airship was also dropped too fast. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists can find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior.
