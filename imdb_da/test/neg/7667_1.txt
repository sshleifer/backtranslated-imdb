There is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh. Next to Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, The Marx Bros and ..... (fill out your own special favorites), make room for everyone along with "Airport 80 - Concorde, the movie". Robert Wagner in particular exceeds all expectations that give life's comedy performance. I would never have thought he had it in him. The only way he could have been more fun would have been wearing a red nose and a revolving tie. British film actors recognize the cool from Cannon and Ball pretending to be a Russian athlete, a good trick if he could have pulled it off, but tragically he couldn't. I have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as fun. George Kennedy - Bless Him - has a role that requires him to talk and move at the same time, and my goodness he triumphs! Brow wrinkled with effort, he sends timeless dialogue, every word lovingly polished to chain-like shine. Only once in twenty years does Hollywood exhibit a movie like "Airport 80". All the years of tiredness and struggle, sweat, tears, homework with Lee Strasberg, who lives on suitcases, born in suitcase, etc. Etc. Everyone will work. A work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them. I think I'm ready for my medicine now.
