Huge suspension of disbelief is needed, where Will's "genius" is concerned. Not just in mathematics - he is also very well read in economic history, able to shrink several shrinks, etc. No, no no. I don't buy it. While in it, they might as well have him wearing a big "S" on his chest, fly faster than a jet and stop bullets. Among other issues ... true genius (currently hailing the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless homage) is not merely displayed / ex nihilo /. It is never so many faceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries. <br /> <br /> Better to have made a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon is too short.
