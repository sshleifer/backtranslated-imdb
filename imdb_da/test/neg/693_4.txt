Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | thank goodness | Being held in three different places, and while it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. There are only really two battles that really broke out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. There are some entertaining celebrities on hand, such as Susan Saint James, Ray Charles, and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see it everywhere. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff vs The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had, and despite the crazy finish, it was surprisingly tolerable thing where the crowd really was in it. Crowd chants "Bullsh * t" at the end. That said, it didn't matter for each one's career. The match ends in a double count with those fighting outside the ring. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br/> <br /> Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The Animal" Steele. Not the great wrestling clever, but highly entertaining because of the antics involved, and a great comedy from Steele, besides savage can break a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes for leverage. <br/> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts Vs George Wells. For a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to influence anything. Roberts wins with DDT, pulls out the snake afterwords, which awakens Saint James. <br /> <br /> Boxing Match. Mr.T / W Hati Kid & Joe Frazier vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva & Bob Orton. A big failure in my opinion. I was saddened by the meaningless throughout this, and although it may have been a marketing success, it certainly failed to entertain me. Many Rowdy chants are also visible. T wins at DQ when Piper strikes T. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Women's title match. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Miniature. Ending too fast before it even gets a chance to start, make a record for quick pin fall, as far as Woman's matches are concerned. Moolah wins when she utilizes the velvet's missing syringe from the top rope. <br/> <br /> 0/5 <br /> Corporal Kirchner vs Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Great pop for corporal. Stupid matches with dull insults from both involved, while they are much too short to do anything. Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassie's stick. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the NFL talent involved. It is also remarkable for Bret Hart's first ever Wrestlemania appearance. Others win when he throws The Heart Foundation out. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano & Ozzy Osbourne Vs Dream Society / Johnny Valiant | C |. Absolutely amazing game, it's one of the best wrestlemania matches all the time. You will not have time to catch the weather, with all the maneuvers at hand and the excellent in ring psychology. This is pure wrestling at its finest, you can't call yourself a Wrestling fan if you don't like this fight. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides heads with Valentine <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules Hernandez. Very decent match here, with both men put on solid performance. Hercules is a creepy brute, with above average skills, and it opposed well with Steamboat's high flying style. Steamboat wins with a high floating crossbeam of the top rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis vs. Uncle Elmer. Terrible fight, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I don't. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> Funk Brothers vs Tito Santana & JYD. Beautiful solid match here, with many memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk | one through the table was something else for that time |. I should rate this as my 2nd favorite. Funks win with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most overheated fights in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can't fight for one, and Bundy is not that big. The violence was brutal at the time, but Hogan's superhero is a little annoying and there are too many dull moments. Hogan wins when he flies before Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a mistake in most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but neither do you. There is not enough here to satisfy a true wrestling fan. Vince blew it on this one. Don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it's really a boring affair like most of the card. Not recommended and stands as one of the worst Wrestlemania outside the glorious rooftop battle. <br /> <br /> 4/10
