I felt I saw an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director filmed it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Terrible script. <br/> <br /> Awful play. <br /> <br /> The worst production I've ever experienced. A few bad CG effects, and the rest of the movies were used to walk around what looked like a junk yard. <br /> <br /> I usually don't write reviews for movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste your time with this movie!
