Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Pathetic in almost every way. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD right in the box - I didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local store. <br /> <br /> effects are beyond a joke. The pond control room looks like cardboard. The water looks far in scale with the background - nothing works. <br /> <br /> There is the easy plot - about as deep as a Scooby Doo cartoon. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait for them to drown.
