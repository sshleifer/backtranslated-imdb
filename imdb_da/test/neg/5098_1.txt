Seen in the mid-1800s when the British clear the New Zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. The daughter of a British Army surgeon, Sarah (Samantha Morton), falls in love with her son of one of the Maori leaders. Maori is a native tribe and a dangerous people for Europeans to deal with. When Sarah's child, whom she calls "Boy" is born, his father is dead. At age six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family, and Sarah will begin his search for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland) who is deeply in love with her. <br /> <br /> Two-time Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. Also starring are: Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and violent fighting scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading, and the DVD cover with Sutherland only, and that you think he is the leading star, must be a crime.
