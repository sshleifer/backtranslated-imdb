Sometimes you ignore the little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". We should all pay more attention to the small voice. It may be the worst movie I've ever had the pleasure of sitting through, or it might be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a forward button. Made on a budget somewhere near $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is, of course, a quick ticket to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-loads of dark-claustrophobic gamblers-unknown panties like "The Cave "and" The Descent ". Some years back there were similar rashes of watch-like movies that used sailing ships instead of caves. Everyone had scary boats / submarines-lots of dark-claustrophobic adventurers - unknown threats ... same old same old. "The Cavern" is really "The Blair Witch Project" only this time, we are lost underground and not lost on it. Throw in a flashlight with missing batteries, a cow skull with fangs glued to it for a monster, and one of the stupid "twist" climaxes ever put on film. That said, let me encourage you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. I'm your friend. I want you to have a good life. Stay away from this movie.
