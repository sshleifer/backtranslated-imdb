This had the promise of being an interesting movie. The subject was certainly a promising - the Catholic Church's transgressions during the counter-reform. Not only was this not developed (except for an introduction in two sections), but many things were not explained - ie. gypsies, the anabaptists, the inquisitors and their relationship with the one true church. Nor was the policy of time explained, ie. the relationship between the Catholic Church and its followers as the Holy Roman Emperor. Although these may have been apparent to an Austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes the Americans confusing. <br /> <br /> But it is perhaps a good thing that they did not emphasize the story when they showed it was pretty inaccurate anyway. Instruments of torture, bloody executions, witches and heretical burnings, great shining swords and beautiful golden relics are the stars of the movie. It could just as easily be one of these Conan-type swords and Turkish films, only with period cover ...
