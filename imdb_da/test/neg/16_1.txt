For years I've been a big fan of Park's work, and "Old Boy" is one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> With lots of anticipation, I rented this movie to find only the worst movie I've seen for a while. It's not a really scary movie; There is no excitement in it, and even the "light" part is so boring that I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got from this. For me, an idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you loved movies like "Old Boy", Waste Mr & Lady "Vengeance" or even his short movie on "Three Extremes", not your time, the movie is not worth it.
