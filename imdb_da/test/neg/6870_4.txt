There is really little positive that can be said about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a truly convincing hero and even moreso when he tries to go undercover as a villain we are supposed to believe, drink too much and knock his wife a little. Margaret Leighton, who's wife / undercover sergeant is a bit more convincing, but it's still hard to believe that any cap that is worth for their salt would not have looked through their charade in less than a minute. The reason if a bullion heist is stupid and the action pulls rather than grip. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way as David Tomlinson seems to play all his roles, is the only glimpse of light in a totally dull affair.
