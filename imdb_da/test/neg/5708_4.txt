A woman engaged in art begins to have a passionate love affair with a man named John. They love anywhere they go and they play sexual games. The problem I had was that it was all they did. There was no plot for this movie at all, or I didn't see it. The hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else to do. Maybe he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret. I just needed something and everything there was was a bunch of love for making scenes. Not that it was bad or anything, I just wanted more things to happen in the movie. Maybe a colleague slept with him too. Anything! I was very worried that this was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot then. I wonder what happened.
