Royal Rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn well. The room itself is pretty uneventful, filled with mid-carders, and a winner who really didn't make sense, and why on earth did The Young Stallions vs. The Islanders main event? half of the amount left. Jessie Ventura sounds bored through half of things and you can tell when he mentions that he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura have no knowledge of Gorilla and Jessie. <br/> <br /> Ricky Steamboat vs Ravishing Rick Rude. Heavily disappointing struggle, with too many resting, and too much of a weak pace, synchronizes this. When it occurs as crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat winner of DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Dino Bravo is now trying to put a new bench press entry where Ventura mocks him. Horrendous segment, with no entertainment value what so ever. Ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted it was boring. Controversial or not, I wasted enough time on this crap. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Gender's Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Vs The Jump Bomb Angels. This is the best match of the night, no I'm not fun! Very exciting thing for woman's wrestling, and you are being hard pressed to find things as well, now a day. Jumping Bomb Angels was far past, and the audience went ape sh * t for their title victory. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> Contract signing between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but there are a few noticeable boo to him, probably because it's in Canada. A bit too drawn to my taste, but it was necessary for the story. It got the point across, and had some effective moments, but many times I kept saying "Continue with it". Both characters, and Andre beat Hogan's head on the table and push the table on him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Very weak Royal Rumble, probably due to awkward pacing and the true lack of star force. I think Vince tested the waters with this one and it showed. Ventura seems uninterested and I do not blame him. Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win and shouted DDT almost every 5 minutes where he was in there, and while Duggan got a good pop I don't think he was the winner they wanted and where did it take his career? Nowhere. Brets first ever Royal Rumble and he made an impressive display. It wasn't terrible, but it was pretty sharp, and it didn't have enough to make the show, considering it was the show. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Standard Hulkster interview, but not with the same delusion and monstrous remarks that he usually draws. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre are interviewed. Others claim he will hand over the championship to Mr Dibiase. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br/> <br /> 2 out of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Islanders Vs The Young Hinges. The crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them are bolted to exitens. It's pretty boring and didn't have anything in the main activity. Jessie and Vince seem bored and argue about other things while the fight is going on. Islanders win because of taking advantage of Roma's injury. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Historically important, I assume, but there is really nothing to see here. This was just a starting point for good things to come to The Royal Rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there's nothing here to go out of your way to see. I usually recommend everything once to Die Hard Wrestling fans, and considering it's the 1st Royal Rumble event, I also assume, but prepare to get bored a lot of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
