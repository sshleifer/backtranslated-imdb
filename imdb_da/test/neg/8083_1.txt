I thought it would be an Ok movie after seeing the advertisements about it. It was fun on some parts and some very ugly. The only person I felt sorry for was Horatio Sans, who had a hot wife cheating him with other women. But he never got the chance to get a triangle with it before and it was good, but they should have done more through the movie.
