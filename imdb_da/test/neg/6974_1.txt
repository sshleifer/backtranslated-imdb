"Glen or Glenda" was Edward D. Wood's first attempt to control a feature film. For this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart ... transvestism, "art" of a man who wants to dress in women's clothing. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with topics that were largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood did not have the budget or know how to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a prologue of Bela Lugosi, which gives little meaning and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) using psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) is trying to understand why a man will live (and die) like that. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her about his occupation. And that's it. We see endless stock footage shots of everything from highway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, strung with shots of wood going down the same street dressed as either Glen or Glenda and looking long at women's clothing in a storage window. The poor old Bela, who was down on his luck and befriended Wood, keeps popping throughout the story. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Bela scenes were added to his name value after the movie's body was completed. To add to the confusion of Lugosis's story, Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides screen narration. Lugosi continues to say, preserve, preserve ... take care, beware, and some gibberish about snakes and snails and whale sharks. <br /> <br /> The story also deals with a transvestite that has had a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Woods character (s). The dream sequences are ridiculous. A wedding order where someone dressed as the devil is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors (?) Fully dressed but leaves little to the imagination, risqu√© for 1953. This movie along with Wood's other "classics" was so bad that they were embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For that reason, they have survived to this day.
