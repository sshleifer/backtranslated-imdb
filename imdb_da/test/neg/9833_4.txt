I have noticed that many movies that have been featured on the Mystery Science Theater have received a lot of low ratings on IMDb. But some of the movies on the movies were not that bad, and it is not fair to judge a movie that has received the MST treatment - with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I DO NOT say that "The Girl in Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it is not bad enough to deserve its current IMDb score of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the Bix and Danny meeting. Bix is ​​a veteran driver and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to walk around the country. When they blow into a small town, Bix must save Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive - a good way to say he has the intellect of a tomato. <br /> <br /> Along the way, something happens to the self-assured Bix - he finds a nice young lady and finds the lid to keep pulling on him. And in a strange subplot, Jack Elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders the city that scares the crap out of everyone - though strangely, the police don't seem to notice much, nor do anyone on their own do anything about him. Ultimately, when Elam moves on a girl to whom Bix falls, things come fully. <br /> <br /> All in all, but not at all a big movie, there were many interesting album elements in this movie - enough to earn a score higher than 2.1. The biggest negatives are a simplified conclusion to the mystery that comes close to the end, as well as Danny's overall stupidity once too often. However, given the small budget, it is an affordable small movie.
