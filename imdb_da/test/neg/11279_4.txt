For a movie made in Senegal, based, I guess resolved on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this movie does not achieve a similarity in history that has become known as an opera and as other films. <Br /> <br /> Ms. Gai as the frame of the title is very good to look at. Her burning dance crumbles the screen, as is the case with her brutal love scene at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a frame designed to please every sex, but a genuine Carmen, she is not! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Ms Gai in other films where her talent is better used than here.
