Now this strange movie. It was performed as a comedy, but I certainly found nothing to laugh at. In fact, I struggle to find something positive to say about this movie. Oh here I go. Alex Ferns is not bad in the lead, and I did not choose the end for a change, but apart from this it has no really really two-dimensional characters and is not fun enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any kind of decent drama. I would really avoid having to watch this movie again and think it doesn't matter to any of the working class characters it is trying to portray. I found it difficult to empathize for any of the characters and was not given enough information about the protagonist Jimmy to believe in his motives. Best avoided.
