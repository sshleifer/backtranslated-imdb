This movie should never have been made! It stinks, it's terrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Starting to see a pattern here? Jackie Mason is definitely no Rodney Dangerfield. Gone were Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who along with Dangerfield were crucial to the first movie. It seems that the three of them (the stars) all knew a stink of a script when they saw one. The one who didn't have the good sense to bend out of this was Chevy Chase, who stuck but was out of both movies in my opinion. This movie is simply NOT FUNNY. It also has no other great qualities. This thing is heavily dependent on anti-Semitism for work, and it does hurt. I hated this thing. A waste of everyone's time.
