May 2: Someone complained 11 no and then continued to do 15 more on my previous 15 comments: almost as fun as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1st: <br /> <br /> As I write this, I'm still very much impressed by what should be the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a big case of giggles, but I will try to calm down. (It's a little hard to write when your nose wastes twisted and the mouth occasionally ejects the evening on the keyboard.) <br /> <br /> A couple of young women just coming back from a vacation are taking a walk on a bus. A few young guys participate in them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it is a kidnapping vehicle. (Don't sneak!) Its driver has been part of an organized "white slavery" band that slips young women from airports and they've been doing it for five years. (Don't laugh.) Five years at the same airport, without the police or even the FBI ever getting any wind of it. (No giggling, thank you.) Apparently, dozens of women disappear in the same exact location for years and years - yet no one discovers any trend. Is the FBI incompetent? The world of "Shuttle" seems to consist of three types of people: slightly kidnapping blonds, stupid / comatose / invisible FBI agents and all-powerful psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy lace with tattooed behinds). <br /> <br /> The driver has barely kept alive on this one mission, yet he has done it for - I repeat - five years without being killed or losing one of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Should I mention it? We all know that film psychoses have immortal DNA. You can poke them, skip them at a bus repeatedly, throw them softly with a hammer, plug nineteen nails into your ears ... Hell, you could hold a hand grenade in the average Hollywood psychos mouth and he would still escape with only minor scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even a smaller demon, but just a regular Hollywood psycho with better survival capabilities than the biggest, best sewerage lacquer. <br /> <br /> The basic plot overview: A guy loses all his fingers on one side in a silly scene. (A magical bus that reads and obeys minds!) The passengers are trying to escape. They fail. They get hurt. The sultry. They argue. They are trying to escape. They fail. They get hurt. They argue. They are trying to escape. They fail. They get hurt. They are trying to escape. They fail. They are trying to escape. The kidnappers manage to pull the gun from the driver! Unfortunately, they do not kill him because the golden Hollywood rule of gandhi-like pacifism forbids them to do so. (No giggling.) One of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied at Rob Zombie / John Travolta School of Over-Acting & Silly Mugging. He threatens rape. Later, one of the bumps hits him with a ball bar over his head, about a dozen times ... very difficult. Only seconds later, he regains consciousness. Yep, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He is killed a little later. (No idea how, even! He should not be killing.) The kidnappers argue. They are trying to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, psychoses are far too divine in their powers not to resume their prey. The game starts all over again: the passengers are trying to escape. They fail. The sultry. They are staring into the cavity. They get hurt. They are trying to escape. They fail. They get hurt ... <br/> <br /> You get the picture. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that a skilled, highly disoriented, undeveloped snail would have easily avoided these nincompoop traps. There were so many options. At one point these bumbling psychos (remember: FIVE years!) Even send one of the kidnapes to a grocery store! She leaves a message to the police. But yes ... you guessed it: This fictional fairytale American city has no police. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought the movie couldn't get any stupid - not even if Luc Besson and Brian De Palma got together to borrow the hand with the script - it does. The girls are kidnapped to be sent to some remote islands (?), And this is achieved by transporting them as cargo. Apparently, this fictitious America has no FBI, no police - nor any border duty. However, it has immortal criminals with more luck than 20 lottery winners. A blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. How is it that victims in these stupid thrillers NEVER try to end their immortal opponents when they have them down on the floor and wounded? I suppose I answered it myself: they are immortal! So why do genes try, she must have thought ... So why did a blonde gas kill, and the other was boxed and sent live (complete with a kitty box and the funniest photograph since Demi Moore's primary school pictures)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed it more beautifully, but it's just me. Was her tattoo so ugly? <br /> <br /> Can't I care? Why should I search for logic in a movie made of imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Also, how can I even think when I laugh so hard half the time? Of course, this is a 21st century horror / thriller, the mobile phone doesn't work ... Maybe this invincible gang not only controls the FBI, police and customs, but also satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Can I spell it out? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And much more intelligent people to make movies. Give an idiot a camera and he puts an egg every single time ... That kind of corresponds to the eternal riddle that first came: the egg or the bird-haired director.
