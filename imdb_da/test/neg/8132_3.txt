I really wanted to like this movie, but it was surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented, but overall the film didn't pay. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; Charismatic and sympathetic (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more accessible but deliberate kind of way ...), but even he couldn't save that mess in a movie. Scenes dragged too long and points were eventually killed. The banana scene frowns upon self-absorption, which apparently shows how much the movement was in his boxes. But in his defense it was his first film as an instructor (which I am aware of) and I appreciate his love power. It left me empty despite what was trying to be said. In the end, I think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. From what I've seen of the 'extras', there is a real story behind this, and perhaps when I finish seeing them, I will appreciate this experiment more.
