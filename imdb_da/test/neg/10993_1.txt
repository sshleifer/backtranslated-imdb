One of the worst movies I've seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a stupid thriller or a stupid comedy. <br /> <br /> Since nothing happens, the cavity is filled with long, boring dialogues that don't make sense! <br /> <br /> The game is famous but gives no emotion except to speed up the game! <br /> <br /> And it happens in a lavish bath hotel that looks really bleak. For comparison, one of "Shining" is fun! <br /> <br /> Note: Many users believe it is in the French Riviera! They're wrong! It's not Southern France (Nice, Cannes) but quite the opposite: Cabourg & Normandy, to be the simple beaches on D-Day! Therefore, the sea is as weeping as the sky, and there is no sun!
