While a young mental woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) walks off the water, it stumbles upon something completely different. She discovers a coffin that has been buried for centuries on its aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt hopes for, her chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devilish worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telegraphic steering of the hired hand that opened the chest, Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body ?? also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm. While Jessica is sure she feels the presence of evil, can she stop Drew's plans and will she be in time to prevent him from becoming whole? <br /> <br /> I thought I was pretty much familiar with most of Universal's horror output prior to 1960, but this is a Universal movie from the 50's that certainly doesn't mention anything. While what could not die is not what I would call a "good" movie, it has some things going for it. First, the film has some interesting ideas and is actually quite ambitious. Director Will Cowan, whether happy or helpful, is able to give the film a good mood from time to time. And the special effects that involve the head are certainly incredible. But the whole project is oppressed by the actor. I'm shocked to hear that some of the supposed "actors" in this thing ever appeared in something else. You would think this was a "one-and-one" type movie for most involved. Kearney is the worst offender. She's horrible. The thing that could not die may also have been a little too ambitious for its own good. Given the budget and other limitations, there was no way the film could strive for its higher ideas. Finally, the film ends quite abruptly. Like things start to get interesting, The End. What is it about?
