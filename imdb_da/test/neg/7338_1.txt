What a sharp movie. I can't believe I actually sat down and looked at it. A very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, without any redeeming qualities at all. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "racing" sequences are ridiculously horrible, and the reason was so bad I forgot. Part of the film was made at the Spa-Francorchamps course in Belgium, I think, in 1988, during the actual Grand Prix there. I was there and am glad that I didn't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the movie. It could have been good ... what a shame.
