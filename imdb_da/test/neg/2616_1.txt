Very disappointing seventh chapter of this slowly dying series. Very clear that the budget was extremely low. This film was made for a reason and a reason alone. To sell puppet theater for toys! Fans, like myself in the series, have decided from what I have read and heard that the only one in the series is worse than this is the curse of the puppeteer. On the other hand, we turn away from the series. <br /> <br /> Choices to make this a PG-13 movie, for whatever reason, didn't work in the movie's favor. The reason almost seemed to be there, but was easily lost in the steady stream of fog. <br /> <br /> The only movie in the series that is worth watching, also directed by Decoteau, is part 3 - Toulon's Revenge. <br /> <br /> Permitted, I favor the landscape of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yuck!
