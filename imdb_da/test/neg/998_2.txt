Beginning with a reverberation poem and pictures of American missiles, starving children and mutilated Palestinians, I soon realized that this was not an objective documentary. 5 youths convicted of the gorgorgens dissolver are interviewed and give a very confused explanation as to why they had to separate the city center and then (oh my god) actually paid for what they did. I watched and many questions raised, the experiment was properly done, and the police had the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked ... and then fell. No interviews with judges or review of documents about the trial .. nothing. <br /> In short: No news from what every Swedish has seen on television a hundred times - just bad propaganda.
