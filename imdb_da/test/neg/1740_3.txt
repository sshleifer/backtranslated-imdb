This weak attempt to awaken your typically gentle Japanese horror movie more to an eerie cult line did not have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved throughout. Translated to whirlwind, Uzumaki is all about it - an irrational and convincing tribute to the weird downward spiral of nothing that apparently has fascinated a small town for dementia lunatics. Though this certainly creates a comfortable b-movie on the surface, the traditionally tiring action, direction and script will only get some Asian horror buffs to shake their heads in horror. What could have translated into Japanese equivalent of an early David Lynch piece, instead, shows that it is spiral gimmickry before it even has a chance to explain itself - which of course does not. Apart from a few cleverly applied techniques, the film rarely connects the dizzying themes with the boring script that ultimately comes across as an inexpensive exploitation of the cult genre that replaces hollow images for real matter. When the movie was finished, there was hardly anything that was obtained from any of the interactions, saving a little bit of scenes or pictures that rose above one note film. I welcome the decision makers to at least try to take the genre into more supernatural, metaphysical realms and understand the rough lost lost translations, but with zero substance to get back to some of the freakishness, this is likely to be referred to unclear fanboys bong -cared basements.
