Lovely music. Beautiful photography, some of the scenes are breathtaking and affect. But the dramatic excitement is lost in a movie that is so poorly edited that it's hard to know what's going on. At times, the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. He was supposed to be a factory worker who comes into trouble and gets to work on a farm. We see dozens of agricultural traders sweaty and dirty in the hot sun. Then we see Gere, looks like he just walked away from a Calvin Klein ad. Sam Shepard, another glamor guy, must be terminally ill. But he looks good. Nice try, but it just doesn't work. Brook Adams is trying hard but she is lost in nature. The real star is the girl.
