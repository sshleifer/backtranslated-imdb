One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After seeing it, I go out, what happened? I'm confused to this day, can anyone explain that movie to me, please? Both the picture quality and the picture quality are so bad, you think you are looking at someone else's school project made with a home camera. First, I can't believe how some people could give 10 stars to this movie. Because it's an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There are even no typical horror cliches as well. The plot and action of this movie was terrible. It is not amazing, surreal or scary. It's just a bad Turkish feature so far. And finally, there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary signs. When I see 'Gomeda', I fell into so hopeless, so sad for the young Turkish filmmaker. Please do not make 'cinema' like this one!
