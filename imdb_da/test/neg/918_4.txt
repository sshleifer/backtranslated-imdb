This experimental sound film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is remembered mainly as Paul Robinson's first film. It is very artistic, with pictures that often seem meaningless to the story, which is hard to understand anyway because of the lack of sufficient intertitles. From what I gathered, Robeson's wife is Adah, in a passionate love affair with a white man named Thorne. It does not disturb the cigar-chomping owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to have a lesbian relationship with a barmaid), but an old lady expresses the city's view in an inter-title: "If I had my way, We wouldn't allow Negroes in here. "Thorne is also called" nigger lover "by one in the bar. Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson), but leaves him. Thorn's wife, Astrid, goes out of the deep end, burns a knife, cuts the thorn's arm and cheek and dies in some way. Thorne must have been charged with murder because we learn that he is acquitted. As for Pete, he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it's best for everyone to leave town. So the movie is more about racism than anything, but in a note, the owner Pete says "The sad thing is, they think they're right. That's how we are." The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to the fact that Adah is the light skin (a borderline negro) or the main character of the protagonists.
