Somehow, this documentary about Miles manages to contain very little music and no complete melodies. Although Miles appears in the movie, 95% of interviews are others, not Miles. There are great chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood entertainment, his drug abuse) skipped or gleamed, and you will learn a little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. Skip it over.
