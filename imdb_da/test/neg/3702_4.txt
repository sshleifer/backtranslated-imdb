The films from the Science Fiction Channel (Sci-Fi Channel) have become boringly predictable. It seems to be low on budget, originality and plot. In this creation, the government is out to get a lot of telecommunications and recruit a poor soul with incredible means to help. There is plenty of over work reused phrases on evil governmental theme. Black coats, shadows, short pointless lines make these one-dimensional cartoons. Daniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. He brings a bit of the style to his "Angel" character to the role. It is difficult to miss the link that his "Crusade" character was a telepath and this is a film about telekinetics. Was this a Sci-Fi casting movement to try to draw fans from the second show? Who knows. Fortunately, he is a decent actor and a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> The movie is absolutely low budget. It reflects Sci-Fi Channel's current model for Canadian placement, few known signs, few effects, and terribly horrible plot and character development. You think they think science fiction fans will see something labeled "scifi". <br /> <br /> If you want a good telekinesis movie, check out the "Fury" (1978).
