"Committed," as in Heather Graham, who is committed to saving her husband / marriage, and then being committed to a psychiatric ward in the absence of doing so: What smart, clever use of words. <br /> <br /> One of the pointless will be philosophical films, where narrative is a series of oh-so clever poetry (90s chic club poetry, better known as "chit-chique poetry") ). Oh, that's so je-ne-sais-quoi ... Written / directed (or "authorized") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, who you'd rather), this is a meaningless, lethargically directed road movie filled with New Age spiritualistic nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are only seen - before or just blunt. The Latin in this movie, as part of the poor urban minority, is typically glorified in all their mystery-obsessed primitivism as a "spiritually superior" people, which is the "highlight" of the film's political correctness. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is lifeless and ceases to be so only when occasionally good cast members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, which is one of the very best examples of why nepotism is on par with first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a skinny, ugly moron who walks through his lines in a sleepy way, almost as if he spoke them in a half-wave quasi-dream plus the weak voice, one of the weakest manual voices I've heard in my life. (He must have gone to Tobey Maguire's family school to act.) Throwing this idiot into something speaks volumes about any movie, ie. about any director or manufacturer. Therefore, Lisa Krueger is a talented waste of space. We also have the moron that starred in the MST3K spoofed "Werewolf"; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Check out his ridiculous accent and the silly speech.
