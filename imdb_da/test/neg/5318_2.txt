This was painful! Recently given away as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this British-Belgian co-production from 1977 (could have fooled me, it looks ten years older than that at least) is quite deservingly unclear and if you do it past half -hour brand, consider yourself as a trouper. The combination of animation and live action is at best ropey and even horrible in the worst case, which makes you wonder why it was decided to even try to make the movie this way, when it was clear that technology was not there. Harris is no more than a human prop, and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless I have seen with the mandatory "trippy" moments (especially where the Brainiac-type subtracto character animation is involved) that gave countless comics features from the late 60s and instantly dated. The manuscript of Don Black gives a convincing argument to the usual resilient copywriter who adheres to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored. As for adults, stick to Jonathan Swift's original novel.
