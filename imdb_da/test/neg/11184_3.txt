The price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too" expensive. <br /> <br /> Having only seen the English-translated version may be the reason for a low rating from this viewer. <br /> <br /> That made the overall movie poorer than the story material suggested on ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments seem to indicate that the subtitle version would be better. <br /> <br /> However, some platinum elements remained inexplicable and left an unfinished feeling. <br /> <br /> It also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?". <br /> <br /> A shame that was no longer (at least anyway).
