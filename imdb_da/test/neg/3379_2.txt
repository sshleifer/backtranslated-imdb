This episode had potential. The basic prerequisite for a woman living next to an empty apartment (but a phone constantly calling) is something interesting. And when she explores noise, there is real excitement and fear. But stupid manuscripts destroy any promise the episode had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us driving in the other direction (eg, "It's fun to shut the door even though there's no wind;" " This door has serious damage to what was not here a moment ago; "" The door opened itself without touching it; "etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in space, would she not take any precautions before entering it? Maybe she could investigate the day. Or maybe she could examine the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she could turn on the lights !!! Also in the haunted apartment, she decides to make many phone calls to the operator and gets an argument over who has the power to interrupt the phone, and then they begin to discuss the details of the suicide. Just put the phone out! The telephone company need not be involved. Go up to the phone and unplug it. The case is closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's just comical to show the phone scam across the floor as if it were alive. If the director wanted the woman to be suffocated by the phone card, he could have done it in a way that doesn't look comic. Brave Little Toaster Anyone?
