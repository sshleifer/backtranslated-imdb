It can hardly be called a good movie, in fact it is not even close. But I have to say that there were a few things that made me ... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The resover dog's parody was one of them. The rest is not important enough to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this movie. The ground sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just too messy and the actors where not good for the characters; Most of them are simply overloaded. There were also a lot of unusual sequences, it was a total waste of movies. I realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter, but it would only do better. <br /> <br /> Now with the good and the bad things lined up, let's go to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats up for this.
