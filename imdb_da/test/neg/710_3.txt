Oh, why did that end? Laurel and Hardy's last movie, from the ugly cranked up Guck theme (with erroneous credit to Hal Roach) to the final "Nice mess" / "I couldn't help it" schtick, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of itself. In between, their relationship is now solely based on uncertain acting, asinine dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. People slate King of New York, but Chaplin's final bend was not nearly as insignificant as this. <br /> <br /> What really hurts one who loves Laurel and Hardy is the look of the two comedians. The video tape I hold shows them on their primary, all boy-like smile and glowing skin with a blur on the back that reads, "The photograph on this holster is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film." Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The actual movie sees them at least fifteen years older than the pictures adorning the sleeve, with Ollie unsatisfactory obese. This is not humorous or comical, fat that he would normally appear but poorly looked at and on the edge of obesity. He would be dead seven years after this film was made, after a series of strokes. Stan, on the other hand, suffers from a prostrate problem and dysentery, sees ghoulish as its weight has dropped drastically. Every time something bad happens to him, like being broken between a lifeboat and a table, you are afraid of his life. Even Ollie gives him a traditional blow making you afraid he might be killed. He would last another fifteen years after the completion of this film, ultimately away from a heart attack in 1965. It is disturbing to think of such beloved artists who grow old and dying painful deaths. And it is disturbing to see their deterioration, both in health and in performance, on the screen. When, and I'm sure, almost everyone else likes to think of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, busy bodies or our relationships. Seeing them in such physical ill health and performing bad routines at the dog of their careers is a shock to my happy memories of them. <p> <p> The warning signs are clear from the opening credits, which list not only four authors but also someone to come up with the concept and a credit for "gags". So if Monty Collins wrote "gags" then what were the other four writing? And in that case, Monty Collins was paid a fee, as there were no signs of a single "gag" in the whole movie? Over 40% of the film is used to travel to the eponymous island where we experience some of the most painfully invisible scenes in which the boys were ever involved. When I saw the battlefield scene, I wanted to curl up and die, so great was its childish ceaselessness. But what kills the movie stone death is that all the supported casts are doubled, unable to speak English. This not only makes the movie disjointed, but it also disturbs Stan and Ollie's reactions to their co-stars. Flat on shaking movie stores and utterly horrible editing, this completely highlights the rumor $ 2 million spent on it. Frankly, it seems terrible, and while a DVD release might clean up the picture, the sound and picture quality is much less than any of their Hal Roach work. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie's "friends", Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free drills that stand firmly against Laurel and Hardy's outdated repertoire. This is another big problem with the movie because none of the supporting characters are fun or recorded for the boy's innocent mentality. The doubled hardness shown for L&H ("you - the fat") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits rather than lovable subanarchs. There are signs of somewhat darker political satire - though the Duck Soup is not - and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting subject. Perhaps more relevant now than it ever was, a movie that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes most relevant in 2003. Unfortunately, it is not an entertaining scene where Stan is chosen "the people", it does not really go everywhere. And this somewhat black humor has its hard edges - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implied, and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, just accidentally glazing someone in the face, your idea of ​​good time? After all the years Stan and Ollie share a bed, we also get a certain reference, while Stan accidentally kisses him - Ollie dries off the kiss in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend Antoine ends his life being eaten by a lion. Remind you, I never thought I'd watch a Laurel and Hardy movie, where they should be hung too. The need for the intrusive and eerie story is an additional point to how bad it all is, with the American release (the same version available on video) hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unmanageable, this horribly done, relentless unfunny movie only serves to wipe out the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs.
