When you look 29 years old, Rob Lowe is a detective who is responsible for a murder investigation. <br /> <br /> When the husband of a social woman (Leslie Hope) is found dead, police believe the rich chicken might have something to do with it. Enter Rob, who immediately falls for the beautiful widow, though he claims he is just trying to be "helpful". Rob is such a good policeman, he is able to sneak some of her incriminating love letters into his coat pocket before accidentally throwing them into the fireplace. Monotonous creepy drama with an endless drone of background music. <br /> <br /> This is a good replacement sleeping agent if you have run out of Sominex.
