I honestly don't know where to start when I go through a movie as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. Apart from two or three good laughs scattered throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this hour and half a waste of time and life. It's amazing that someone was able to round off a group of people who were willing to shop, film, and edit this piece of waste, and even more amazingly, this is the eighth part of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the film's opening credits, we see that Ernest constitutes next to various African objects, such as wood masks and heads of African animals that make faces and movements likely to make most 3rd grade laughs. . This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95% of the time. The first thing that really hit me on this movie is how bad it is. Everyone in the movie is a typical C-movie actor, but Linda Kash stands out as particularly horrible. She is the epitome of overactive all her lines come with shocking inhuman enthusiasm that you will only find in a mid-school game. Most high school theater students might have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance. Jim Varney at least shows some comic skills, but for the majority of the movie, he just seems like a complete retard, trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest goes to Africa beginning in Africa, where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The pearls then return to the United States, where an unidentified man is seen from several henchmen through a flea market. He saves them in a bucket of "two for a dollar" items, and then runs off the stage. Ernest is looking for a gift for Rene, a waitress he likes, so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems. He will later take them back to his house, paint them and glue them together to make a yo-yo. He gives yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he's just an average shmoe and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are traced by the craftsmen, and then brought to Africa to be held prisoners. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie really makes no sense. When Ernest is in Africa, he falls out of the truck, carrying him in and landing in a river. In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey You." His skin is dark and he has a linen suit. At first, I thought Jim Varney played another role in the movie beyond Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You Started Talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that stands out in my mind as being quite ridiculous is the carnival scene in the African desert. Rene and Ernest have taken an ostrich truck and are being chased by henchmen. Driving at about twenty miles per hour on a straight road shoots both craftsmen at Ernest, who are behind the ostrich truck. Ernest throws ostrich eggs on the craftsmen and their driver, on the other hand. The craftsmen never hit Ernest once in a five-minute hunt, but Ernest is able to stave off them by hitting them and their driver in the face so that their car floats away from the road and explodes into a large column of smoke. I must also add that Ernest sings twice in eggs, two at a time, from a large bra. <br /> <br /> The set design is also incredibly poor in this movie. There is a large part of the movie where Rene and Ernest go to Africa, trying to find civilization. During their walk, we see them walking through fields and jungles, which probably could have been shot everywhere in the United States. The fields are simply clear grassland, with no indication of being anywhere near Africa (they could at least have digitally added some African trees in the background), and the jungles resemble the forest of rural Connecticut with papier mâchè skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was actually shot in South Africa, but I wouldn't believe it at all. <br /> <br /> The movie continues and again, Ernest joke after Ernest joke. The rest of the film has no meaning either; the African tribesmen all speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later challenged to a "Battle of Truth" by the leading henchman who is suddenly dressed in a ninja-like garment, yet resembles a slavery submissive . His hands have a table of axes, swords, knives and maces in front of him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear and a few other worthless things. But Ernest wins the game and ends up saving the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is painful to watch. I couldn't make it in a meeting I had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a couple of hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Vary's humor. They should really put a surgeon's general warning on the box to let people know they are actually getting a little retarded at the end of this movie. I have to say that out of all the movies I've ever seen, nobody comes close to being as shameful as Ernest Goes to Africa.
