(spoilers) Frighteningly, I've actually seen the movie that this horrible movie was a successor to. It was called Ator the Fighting Eagle and I saw it when I was just 8 years old. It made such a terrible impression on me that I never forgot it. I have been a MST3K fan for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on tape I bought it. I was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the miserable Ator movie I had seen so long ago! Ator's costume has somehow become more frightening than the last time I saw him. How can he carry the little little bikini? Doesn't it matter that it turns out that he has no ... errr ... package? And poor Thong ... he gets no lines and no girl, and must follow the frizzy haired girly doofus Ator all the time. Did others notice that Miles O'Keefe goes like a woman? No wonder he is not interested in the beautiful, if any shiny Meela. The evil, but boasting evil Zor is more to his liking, I'm sure. I loved Zor's cardboard spray painted swan helmet and the way he spent his entire time trying to touch a part of Ator. The battle scenes are so choreographed that it is a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect. The boring old guy spends all his time standing and looking depressed. Ator drinks a cup given to him by a guy who hates him, and then looks surprised that they pulled him. He must be pretty clever, but he invented a coffin in the room in five minutes, then flew into a rift in the space / time continuum so he traveled short in 17th century Bulgaria. It was after he stuck the giant snake doll of course and rescued the mail culture Meela while she was sitting around doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the movie was Thong, who saved Ator several times from his boundless stupidity and killed the evil Zor in the bargain. Kudos to Thong, the only competent person in the whole movie.
