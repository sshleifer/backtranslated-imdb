Okay now, this movie is a piece of work. It is full of stupid jesus refrences and dialougue that would make most human beings to question whether they should be wattching movies at all. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine pull you in, but take it from me, this movie sucks. The story is incomprehensible and completely lacking in intellegence. The sets, weighing wheels and costumes come as a cross beetween bablon five and a bondage flick. I'm sure there is porn with better dialougue.
