I have not seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it is a pretty sure bet that I will not look for many in the future. Some people say comparing this show to "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely believe that this show would not exist if "The Simpsons" had not come first and I absolutely believe it will have so much to be "The Simpsons". I don't understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I have seen, I have understood where they wanted me to laugh, I understand that someone thinks a joke was just told, but the joke is not fun. I find the whole show to be lazy: the title, the "jokes", there is a complete lack of inspiration throughout. The best shows on television (cartoon or not) are created as this: a script is written, it goes through several rewrites, things that do not work are taken out, inspiration is triggered, good things are added, there are more rewrites, and so it is filmed. <br /> <br /> I pictured a "Family Guy" episode to be created like this: A script is written and it is recorded.
