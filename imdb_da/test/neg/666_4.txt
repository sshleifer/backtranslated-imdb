The first official release of World Wrestling Entertainment's film department is a pretty basic horror / slasher movie called "See No Evil" starring Kane, one of their great men's wrestlers known to have a scary presence, hard-hitting movements and one of the most intricate backstories in wrestling. And let's not take any strokes here; While this movie is being promoted as the biggest horror movie all the time (mostly by WWE), it goes without saying that after watching this movie, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> "Look no evil" sees a bunch of youth abusers sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course, there is also a monstrous killer (played by Kane) at this hotel, and we all know where it goes. Without giving away too much of the movie plot, this movie has all seen and structure of an early 80's slasher flicking with most of the cliches intact, but without any of the scary effects that these movies accompany. And this is a kind of main problem with "See no evil". It tries so many of the tricks that its predecessors emphasize in the genre that it comes out as predictable; Veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks in advance, and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next time. It's too generic to be scary. <br /> <br /> The movie is gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. The dark atmosphere instilled in the film initially gives the terrain feeling, but when you get to the end it feels in a way and becomes tiring quickly. The death scenes do not come out as shudder and horrible, as much as they make ridiculous, though some of them are quite imaginative. <br /> <br /> And the play in this movie is also pretty bad, as the protagonists are not developed enough for us to tend when they are eventually combed. Some may not even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. So when they die, it is only the case with the comedy because you don't care about them, you simply consider them Starfleet Redshirts for monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he simply portrayed his film character just as he portrays his wrestling character, using only axes and hooks instead of hellfire and sulfur. There is no doubt that Kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. He has the appearance and presence of it; he just needs better material (especially a script that is not written by a person writing wrestling shows) to work with. <br /> <br /> Now, despite what seems like a tough review, I've actually had the movie. It's one of the ridiculously bad movies that you can't help sitting and enjoying. My main gripe with the movie is again that it is simply an exercise in filming gory kills and does not have any scary or shocking moments. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it because it was easy for me to laugh at some of the scary moments in the movie. If that happens because it should be so, the film would have been rated higher. But it didn't. It was laughing because it is a B-movie, and it does not help that the director's previous experience was porn movies and music videos; not exactly over complicated things to look anyway. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it tremendously. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind a fun B movie or fun horror movie, I highly recommend "See No Evil". If you are a true enthusiast for the genre, I will wait until the DVD comes out before you check it out. Everyone else should see something else.
