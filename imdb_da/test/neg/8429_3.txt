"Disappointing" is the best word I could think of this movie, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users. One thing that really destroys the movie is that it is partially unnoticed (in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focusing as it does on the American athletics team), but it also contains more inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties faced by the American team. What is even more disturbing is that all omissions and mistakes (?) seem to glorify American sportsmen for the exclusion of other athletes (with a few famous exceptions). For example, the viewer believes that the US won the majority of medals in the games, as they actually won only one in four gold medals and one in six in total. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective compatriots (thus we have an arrogant Brit and a French wine). This attitude makes very little service to the Olympic ideals that the film should celebrate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think this movie would appeal to that part of the American audience seeking a quick boost of national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically accurate description of the games are advised to look elsewhere.
