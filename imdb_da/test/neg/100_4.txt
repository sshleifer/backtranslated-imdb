I was looking forward to this movie. Trustworthy actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere so ????? IF you want to try something that is supposed to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Knows it. OK I don't expect the directors or the authors to actually understand the meaning, but I thought they might have offered crumbs to pick up and treat to add fuel to the fire - like! they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman walks around in dark places and lonely parking spaces alone - unaware of the consequences. Great puzzles that fell by the way. The promise of the knowledge contained therein in the original so-called criminals. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the excitement. I understood and can grow lyrical about the fool and found Adrian Paul's role crucial and pervasive and so ????? Basically, the story and script were up to a point and the point in the last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! Such a shame that this movie had to let us down so much. It cannot understand the meaning, and I really do not expect the authors to understand it, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual, trip and got a bump in the way
