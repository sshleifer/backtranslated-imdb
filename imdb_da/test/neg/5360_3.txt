Let me first say that I am a believer of ghosts, and I actually know they exist. I have had enough experience with them to know that they are there. What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and religion into all this. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereotypical religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not do everything in reality, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most sinister Bible bombs break the very rules written inside .... you should never carry more than one fabric at a time, slavery is ok and you can murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, "Oh that was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is the word of God and cannot be changed. There should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts and people who so blindly follow that "there is no other way". The excuses they said that blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot properly explain the differences, and instead use excuses handed to them from either their pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But anyway on the review. I am a decent fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show coming soon, I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like to see "Ghost Hunters", I don't like some of their members, and I don't like the way they can reject a haunted place, but can't explain anything happening. Just because your survey equipment doesn't pick it up doesn't mean the camera didn't film the show. I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's like they don't understand it just because you didn't get something on your recorder and movies don't make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were so easy to catch, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. It's more of a "real place at the right time" kind of thing, as well as if there's something there, what makes you think it'll "do" to you? This show is a little stupid. It is usually boring, and there are plenty of talk, many psychics, but almost nothing happens. The main source's filtered story is usually either boring to listen to or basically not necessary. <br /> <br /> Also, the dependence on psychics is too abundant, which I think MUCH few of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one I absolutely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really liked this show, but of the few I have seen, I have not yet been very impressed.
