This is a boring movie. The real villains are the lumpy adaptation (it is embarrassingly easy to tell that the source material was a novel) and unclear plays. <br /> <br /> On the credit side, the budget was tight because of wartime tightening, the appearance of the movie is not bad at all. And the show is pretty much OK, except for Phyllis Calvert, which is fantastic - a miracle that considers the potential for winomeness, a pit that she definitely does not fall. Calvert, with much less to continue, is as effective as Olivia de Havilland in Gone With The Wind. The one utterly unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terrible devised depiction of a black servant boy. No matter that he is supposed to be a sympathetic character. Played poorly by a white boy in black-face make-up, it is impossible to bypass this example of discouraging racism. <br /> <br /> Grim.
