This is a really unpleasant show. It is actually an example of how low the television has fallen, as "reality" came in style. Tanya is beautiful, but she is also extremely rude and has terrible taste. Is a house showing the place of sex appeal? Apparently some men seem like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not beautiful, but he is just as rude and also has terrible taste. It is unfortunate that so many houses should be displayed while someone is still living in them. Most of the people who supposedly consider these houses before making changes must move into brand new homes or completely empty so they will not offend anyone. Most of them. Just like the "crew" .. must be taught. I can imagine how terrible the British show is, as British reality shows turn out to be even worse when it comes to manners and tastes. What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and for some years afterwards) it was filled with treats. Now it's a big waste machine.
