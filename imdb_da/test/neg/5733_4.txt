Just watched this movie for the first time after buying it on DVD <br /> <br /> It comes across as a cheap attempt to redeem the two Conan movies. Unfortunately, this movie did not seem to have the same budget as the Conan movies and therefore some of the sets and effects are not as flash and some scenes seem to be rushing. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is okay to look at, but unfortunately she could not act if a gun was put on her head. <br /> <br /> Arnie's supporting role looked as though it was a benefit to Director Fleischer, who also instructed Conan the Destroyer. Perhaps Arnie wasn't sure he would continue with headline movies like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. <br /> Some of the female guardians of the talismans early in the movie looked like they were struggling to lift Their swords and the appearance of their faces suggested they had fun making this movie. I couldn't be so jovial if I fought for my life. All this aside, this movie required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining. I've seen a lot worse. Two stars.
