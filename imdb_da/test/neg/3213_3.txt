The wise marketer is he is, Jess Franco of course also deposited on the huge temporary success of psychedelic spy films like Mario Bava's ultimate sensational "Danger: Diabolik!". Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar movie as he freely inserted so much sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurd grotesque plot twists as he wanted. And he understood quite well when "The Girl from Rio" is about a man-hating organization, led by a funky-dressed lesbian who plots to make all men obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them at least), the bad plans conflict with the daily business of a feared criminal syndicate chief played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well presented, but it is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfactory adventure movie. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, as the action is pretty pretty. The film is also very colorful ... but not too bright and particularly shocking was the total lack of evil sex. There is little nudity, safe but too few according to normal Franco standards. All the signs are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped for) was more perverted undertones or fringed themes. Of course, Franco had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and I have to say that he spends the money well on more convincing pieces and talented members. In particular, veteran actor George Sanders ("The Damned Village", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to be seen in a Franco production. Very hardly he can't save "The Girl from Rio" from being a big downturn. A legendary Euro-smut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
