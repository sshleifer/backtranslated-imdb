... this is just not worth a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done cannot be properly called film making; Instead, they chose only sixteen students of a certain diversity (but not quite as many differences as the reviews have suggested) and set them free. The results are, to be brutally honest, far more boring, self-righteous, overwhelmed, and abominable than real insight. There are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of that kind only possible in documentaries, but generally there is not much more truth here than in "Bully" or, for that matter, a decent TV documentary of the same kind. Although full of talk about sex and sexual diversity and racism, the film brings nothing to the table that will benefit anyone who has thought of any of these issues seriously. And while certain segments earn absolutely nothing but injecting a little (admittedly) comic relief, the five-minute limit usually lasts from being emotionally involved in any of the students. An interesting idea, but thumbs down for CHAIN ​​CAMERA.
