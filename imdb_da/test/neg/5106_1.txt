when i first read about "berlin am meer", i didn't expect much. But I was thinking with the right people, the right places, the right music and fashion, you could at least make a trivial movie about hip Berlin, everyone seems to be talking about. But eissels failed, it is so ridiculously unauthorized. It is a complete misrepresentation of what is happening in Berlin's so-called scene. Of course, it's not just about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie sold as "the definitive Berlin movie". And, apart from all credibility issues, it's really a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. Interestingly, some of the actors have appeared in other films that they are actually quite talented. so it really should be poor directing. <br /> <br /> don't bother to see "berlin am meer" unless you are 17, coming from a small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finish school. so you can actually find it fun and totally cool.
