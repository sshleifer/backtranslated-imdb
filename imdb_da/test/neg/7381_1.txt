I rented this movie because the DVD deck made it look like it was a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. I took it to my friend's house to look for movie night. We ended up stopping it 15 minutes in the movie and looking at Copper Mountain instead. I don't know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it's not good either. However, I had to say that Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made it a more comfortable watch. <br /> <br /> Later, I completed the Puddle Cruiser. This movie was slow and humor was forced. This movie reminded me of some stinkers that I saw in some of my previous college production classes. I was left wondering "was it the movie that allowed the Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers?" Also how could this movie suck so badly? Supertroopers were good and the Club Dread was decent. Don't watch this movie!
