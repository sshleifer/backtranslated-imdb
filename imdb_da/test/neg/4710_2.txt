I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did some good work and I thought it could be an overlooked treasure. It wasn't a treasure. I don't know if it was just for video, but it should have been straight to the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will suffer the fact that he looks shirtless in an all too short shower scene. But no sense person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teenagers, but ten times more confusing and one hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently "keeps the chain of mediocre alive"). <br /> <br /> As if false memory syndromes and mindset medicine were not hokey enough, the film also hinges on one of the inexplicable psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience confused. This same twin bond creates a pair for many ornate love scenes between Wood's character and the She's All That girl who plays Wood's angry cancer victim's saintly sister. <br /> <br /> Adding to the fatigue of this play, Wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and kidney, a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. Nire's dying desire is true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. This character is hackneyed function in history matched by his over and over relationship to go. Usually tied to a wheelchair, Kidney has several inexplicable scenes that show he is pushing others around it. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization can be a little detail, but it is a sign of the film's many other errors. Bumblebee Flies Anyway is absolutely bumbling, but it never flies.
