The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof, which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of "Drake & Josh" fame, personally I would have given the movie to Josh, who is much more fun) and "Rick Punchers" joke is lifted straight out of the airplane, so the authors of course already scrape the barrel into ideas for this movie. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics Lab, and this is where we'll meet with the first star name in the movie, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG), which plays Dr Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, where his powers come from. <br /> <br /> We meet our next big star names in Rick's home, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days fame) and Uncle Albert Leslie Nielson of the airplane, Police Squad & Naked Gun fame). And we are introduced to Carlson on the merged board (Dan Castellaneta from The Simpsons), which is then very quickly killed. We are told that Rick has slept for 5 days and get some cheap, crazy sexually oriented scenes designed to get the teenager alert. The Stephen Hawking lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't extremely fun. <br /> <br /> We get another Spiderman spoof (Rick catches the girl and all the planets) but the movie will end right there when Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball that would have broken her skull and killed her stone death. You will see Rick's first powers show up (grasping ability and speed), so his 1st rescue, which goes very wrong. We also get an incest reference which is actually in very bad taste. We get a flashback and a Batman spoof, where we find Rick alone responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Ricks Uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (from Hellboy) playing Hospital Doctor. We then get an X-men spoof (done very badly as Patrick Stewart is as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by yet another lookalike. <br /> <br /> We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson looks great in her costume!). Rick's 1st outing in his costume (when he solves his ability to see and breathe through it) is another Batman spoof. Tom Cruise Youtube interviews are played by another lookalike (and not very well). There are lots of modern references like Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia that show that the movie is set in modern days. There is a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do them either) when Jill helps Aunt Lucille make Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene is not very fun, just baby water. is not very fun, just incredibly childish. Anyone who finds it fun must have a mental age of approx. 12. She is killed, and then we have a really bad nekrophilia joke (is there no subject these people will not try to use to get a cheap laugh out of?) At her funeral, and the even worse cremation scream. <br /> <br /> We get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony, and if you didn't already know how the baby or stupidly low movie is Landers wins the "Douchebag Of The Year" award . Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to pass Jill twice in the same direction). Of course, The Hourglass is full, Jill is rescued from a certain death and the Only Fun scene throughout the movie is the final.
