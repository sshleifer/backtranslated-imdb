the real reason ... <br /> <br /> A group of prosecutors' prostitutes are looking for alternative housing in FORT BOOM. Lacy Everett and a close knit family of call girls have eaten date expired sausages in days and plan to move into the former Fort McMillian. The locals warn the women about eating more of the dated sausage. Because there is an evil pyromaniac in the area and he refuses to move them to the property. When they finally arrive at their destination, they discover that their stomach is full of gas after all the bad sausage. It is not long before they learn why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
