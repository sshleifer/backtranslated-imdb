The producers of this movie must be sued for misrepresentation of copyrighted materials, namely the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Players' Handbook. Fear and ignorance breed the kind of mindless propaganda that inspires waste like this movie. If any of you are in doubt about Dungeons & Dragons innocence, why not go to your local hobby shop and look to sit with a game group so you can see for yourself that D&D is nothing to be afraid of.
