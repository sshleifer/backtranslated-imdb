If you like soap series, you like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch soap series like GTST, Westenwind or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you don't like the stuff: Stay away from this movie. It has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, direction and writing. The film was a big hit in the home territory, but was not sold elsewhere outside Holland and Belgium. Pretty strange for a commercial movie like this one. <br /> <br /> Maybe there's something ....
