Expected more after seeing the cast list, but WOW! I think a first-time instructor could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran such as John Buechler did it, the puzzle did me no end. Somehow, the budget made them secure a number of D-List actors, which they managed to embarrass for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were just horrible, less Steve Wastell doing a decent job as Axl. The story is so bad that it really doesn't have to mention. The overall production value works by default, with somewhat above average camera work, if you can do it through the god-fearing "slo-mo" scenes and the painful "person on fire" sequences. I knew it would be stupid, I just had no idea how stupid, and unfortunately it is time that can never be returned to me. I guess if you enjoy really bad "B" movies, it may work for you, but if you ever appreciate any story, it's just awful ... A complete waste of time.
