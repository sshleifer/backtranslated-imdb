Critters 3 starts on the open road as Clifford (John Calvin) his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and his young son Johnny (IMDb list two actor's Christian and Josephh cousins, identical twins perhaps?) Are heading home from a vacation. Suddenly the tire covers their van and they have to stop at a public resting place to correct it. While Annie & Johnny meet with a child named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes the one), all join Charlie McFadden (co-producer Don Keith Opper) from the two previous Critter films. Charlie tells them the story of Critters & the town of Grovers Bend, but they don't believe him. In the meantime, we put back on the van a Critter some eggs on the underside, out of sight from everyone. Once Clifford has attached the tire, the trio enters their home, a worn out townhouse block in Los Angeles somewhere complete with Critter eggs together for the ride. On arrival, the eggs and Critters head right inside the house block, which quickly handles Frank (Geoffrey Blake), caretaker. When the night draws on the few remaining residents, a female woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repair lady Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly man Mr. Bill Zuckert and Mrs. Menges (Frances Bay) meet with Clifford & his children to fight with critics. Josh also makes an appearance when his regular father (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the group be able to defeat the critics and prevent themselves from having dinner? Director Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly rude movie, but at least she could say she made a movie staring Leonardo DiCaprio & not many can say it! The budget for Critters 3 was probably not exactly a fortune, as the whole production looks cheap, there are very few signs, very few critics and I think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at one time and it is done away with any kind of space angle, so there are no expensive spacecraft or distant alien plan special effects to pay for. The script by David J. Schow is strictly by-figures & highly predictable. A group of people are stuck in an isolated situation with Critters and have no means to contact the outside world for help, the plot scenario sounds very familiar right? Well that's the same as the previous critics (1986) & Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror films so it should. Critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never tries to add anything to an already old, tired and well-used story. Critters 3 is also very pretty tame for a horror movie, where only two people are actually killed, the comedy elements are also largely lacking with the best joke. Critters 3 many can be a Critter who eats some beans and then spins, very fun if your about 5 years old. The characters are mostly standard horror movie cliches & quickly became annoying. There is almost no blood or gore in Critters 3 at all, just a few splashes of blood & disappointing Critters 3 actually seem to go out of the way to not show any violence. The special effects on Critters are OK, but they still look like static, simplistic hand towels that have very little movement. The actor is not as good & Critters 3 happen to be a particular Leonardo DiCaprio's very first feature film, to be fair to the child, he is okay and I wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea of ​​what he continues to stay. Why on Earth should the Charlie guy stop these Critter movies? To give Critters 3 little credit it goes well and is not boring, it is generally well made with good enough production values, and it is a bit harmless if you are in the right kind of mood and luckily it only lasts approx. 80 odd minutes. Overall, Critters 3 is an OK Time Waster, but don't expect anything deep or meaningful. There is nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror movies, but I couldn't help feeling that I had seen it all before. An average time waster that is not as good as one of the two previous Critter films. Critters 3 ends with a 'continue ...' as this was filmed back to back with Critters 4 (1991), who surprisingly went straight to video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can see it on T.V. free, otherwise not bother.
