Shanghai Cobra starts as gangbusters, with a rain soaked dinner scene straight out of Shack Out at 101 or Gun Crazy (the first). Unfortunately, the film continues to plunder its tired way through a standard Chan formula that is barely lively by the ever-wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's like director Karlson blew half of his budget in the first five minutes, and just got the same as he wanted it to. See the beginning and think of The Phenix City Story.
