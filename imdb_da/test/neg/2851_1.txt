First I must say that I really love Udo Kier and have always had respect for Armand Assante, but nothing could save this train wreck from a movie. Udo doesn't even appear later in the movie, and the play from everyone is just awful. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wood, "action" is ridiculous and the plot can be summed up in a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie, but found myself holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating again and again to myself "Oh Udo ..... why ??? .... why ??? .. .. ". If you're a fan of Udo or Armand, don't watch this movie. It will only make you sad for them.
