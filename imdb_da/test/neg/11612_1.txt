The story seemed fine, the actors seemed fine, the movie had to be fine. But it certainly wasn't - it didn't lead us anywhere, <br /> <br /> the scenes are weird. Perhaps it was supposed to create something new to make <br /> <br /> us think. The least did it: Where's the rest of this movie? It was for me that <br /> <br /> a waste of money, time and talent. Someone might see this <br /> <br /> for curiosity to see if they can figure it out. Secondly I personally <br /> <br /> would not recommend this to anyone.
