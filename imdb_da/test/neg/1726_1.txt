Like many others, I figured Dennis Hopper's look to make this not a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Everything negative said about this flic is more than true. What takes the cake, however, is the horrible, horrible story for the protagonist. Here's why: The planet can be destroyed, the only way to recover from it, because all mankind is being saved through it being so many clever, skilled, cozy, competent people into an underground shed. And Dennis Hopper is the lonely viewer / scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this. But what is Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo) main motivation? He is angry because Dennis has decided who to save or be convicted! While it clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis' character has done everything to warn people about the danger but that he was laughing. The Hopper character was the boy with his finger in the dike, and now Stevens accuses him of "picking and choosing" ??? And if that's not enough, he'll stop everyone from entering this hiding place because "it's not fair!" AND .... He is responsible for the death of the only guy who is the savior of mankind! OH MY GOD, how stupid can you get? <br /> <br /> What is also madness that IMDb forces one to write minimal ten lines on this piece of crap. I mean, TWO MILLIONS in the budget, what could have been done with that? Think Clerks, Blair Witch, and many other movies made for under $ 100,000 and were still better. AAAAARGH! I am fortunate enough that I did not pay a crown to see this bushel and sitting at the end of this complete, uber-crap is one of the most heroic things I have done this year. It is no wonder that the authors of this pile of fertilizers had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...
