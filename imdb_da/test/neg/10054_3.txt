The bridge at Remagen contains some of the most prominent wartime manuscripts I've ever seen. Apart from the play, which is wood, no tank commander with his thoughts parked in fine neat rows, up to the middle of roads and with troops, bundles with their arms does not clear. The constant suicide behavior averted my "tilt switch" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently, screenwriters and the director have never been through actual warfare and have never bothered to bring an expert who had. This movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail of Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7, I recommend seeing something else. <br /> <br /> GB
