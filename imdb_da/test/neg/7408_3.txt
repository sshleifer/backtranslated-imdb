I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be a curse when it comes to movies about the unpleasant Bigfoot. There has not yet been a film that intelligently approaches the subject, nor one that creates any real excitement. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film entitled "Sasquatch" (1978) have become less cult-classical, but were not very memorable. Both films were aimed at family-friendly audiences, preventing them from trying to scare anyone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first major budgeted movie to use Bigfoot, with a fantastic creature design by Rick Baker. But they also chose to aim for younger audiences, but this time as a comedy (like "Bigfoot" in 1995). I have long waited for someone to tackle the issue as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of "Jaws" or "Predator". When I saw this on my local video store, I thought my dream had come true. Boy, was I wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the Pacific Northwest hoping to find her daughter when she was aboard a small plane as it crashed into the mountains. The premise is interesting and sounded promising. The truth is, it never builds any real excitement. I never found myself interested in any of the characters, as each one was very two-dimensional and pretty gentle. Even the always reliable Henriksen seems to be calling his performance. Every time he appears on the screen, he looks dull. He should be as there is no action to talk about in the film's first hour. As for the being, where do I begin? I figured we would at least get a cold look that runs around in the woods, but instead we get it bald (yes I said "bald!") Man with sharp black skin and fur spots here and there. Picture a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the lost" and you get the idea. Nothing like the artwork on the cover I assure you. Dull editing and careless direction also add the confusion as half the time, everything seemed out of order, while the other half of the movie was constantly used up with these long, slow fade-outs (which didn't make sense or served any purpose). They even stole the entire infrared vision P.O.V from the being in "Predator", which is just too stupid and out of place to be effective. Perhaps all this shows that Hollywood just has to forget about trying to make Bigfoot movies, as they have not yet made one that works. So far, each has been as scary as an episode of "In search of" 3/10
