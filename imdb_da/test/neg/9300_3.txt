Frank Falenczyk: I'm not so sorry I killed them; It's that I'm sorry, I killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a great plot of endless possibilities ... how do you fake? Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With a terrible play with jokes about as much fun as a malaria epidemic and dialogue that is so painfully dry, it doesn't make any of the characters like: 'You Kill Me' may be the biggest movie bug in 2007. A positive note gives Ben Kinglsey another great performance as the alcoholic Polish hitman tries to clean, but the material he has to work with is bad. Te Leoni is good as well as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the casting. I think the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a horrible movie with good performances. Degree: D +
