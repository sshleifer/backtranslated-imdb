Wow, it was a real stinker. This early sci-fi flick has nothing to do for it than a clean camp. There is so much scientific mambo jumbo in the dialogue, it's ridiculous. The female character played by the Osa Mass is just a plot unit for the male characters to earn sexist remarks throughout the length of the movie. Watch this with your girlfriend, I guarantee that it will make her bloodcoat the only good thing is the musical score that expertise builds the mood of the movie. The special effects are pretty raw, but not bad considering the movie's vintage. With some good B-stars in the lead, the play is not that bad. But the lines they get must have given them quite a challenge. The challenge of not laughing their heads away.
