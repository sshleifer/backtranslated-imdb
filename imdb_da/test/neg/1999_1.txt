This was on SciFi this past weekend and I had to check it out. After all ... it was science fiction with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What can go wrong with this B movie? <br /> <br /> Much. <br /> To begin with: It can't even be classified as a "B movie" because it would put it in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this movie doesn't even meet his expectations. Most of the money they spent was on the contact lenses for the vampires. <br /> <br /> Second, the casting was horrible. Yes, practicing Udo Kier as captain of Demeter was a smart move ... but the director obviously couldn't get Kier to remember his lines. Casting Eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a smart move because it means a bunch of horny guys will buy / rent / record this flick to see her being seduced by a vampire. But the director, the author and the producer also screwed one. Granted, they got some money out of the poor, unfortunate souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them ... but no one will remember this movie in another two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third: Little things that just emphasize the laziness of this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross on a "crucifix", and when Mina is placed in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see that her "breast" is nothing but pillows. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another thing: Why did they go to the George Hamiltion type Dracula instead of something that would look decent scary? Does George Hamilton have an overwhelming team on our future? Why didn't everyone who saw Dracula laugh at him for his get-up? <br /> <br /> Waste of time. Even with a TiVo remote control in your hand.
