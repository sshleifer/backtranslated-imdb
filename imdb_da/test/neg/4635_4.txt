Not bad performances. Whoopi plays the clever / warm role quite well. Still, history and situations cannot be believed (forced pc stereotypes). At times it is good Jews and blacks vs. the evil white Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The movie has its moments, but it's not one I would recommend going out of your way to see.
