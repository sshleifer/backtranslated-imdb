I've seen all 3 now. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison with the others, but only on its own merit or lack of. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how the average for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thoughtful and beautifully finished. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or a negative number was available, I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time was watching this movie. I thought after the first 30 minutes that I should turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow movie. I thought the same after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized it wouldn't get any better. <br /> <br /> It is very boring to see and without any redeeming qualities. Don't take my word for it, see it for yourself. Be sure to watch the first two movies before this one. If you see this first, I can almost guarantee that you will never see the first two, but they are certainly much, much better than this "work". The best part of the movie is when the credits play at the end. That's when your punishment on this earth is complete and you can lapse 89 minutes into the scab, for the affliction you've lived up to seeing this "movie". If God is truly merciful, he will be more generous.
