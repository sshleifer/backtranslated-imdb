I don't care what anyone says this movie was crap. The only thing it had for it was camera work which was very well done. As for the dialogue I have heard so many people talk about ... it also sucked. Yes it was honest and true in life, but then what can I hear that someone speaks such on the street or in a fast food collection. What made the dialogue good in movies like Pulp Fiction, and Gosford Park was the fact that it is WRITTEN dialogue that takes time to think through. Another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture. I think the male character could have been much stronger, but instead it seemed to be weak. In fact, the film seemed to revolve around the male character, and then he disappeared completely in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the film I found completely repulsive, not in appearance, but in her needy needy ways. To say she's in love with a guy and actually gets jealous of him the next day, what a villain of crap. Finally, the sound was horrible, and I hope it was just something that plagued my theater rather than actually being on the film's last cut. There was constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking off the speakers going on. The one good thing was again Blood's job as DP, but the actor who played the main friend's ex girlfriend also did a good job. These two things could not save an extremely horrible movie that I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
