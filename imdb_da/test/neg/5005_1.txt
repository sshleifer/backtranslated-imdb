Ugh. Yes, it's exactly like the McMartin clutter or the horrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother keeps aggressively questioning her little boy over and over until he finally tells her what she wants to hear of course. The court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The question itself is sexually scary, a relentlessly repeated attack in its own way. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers throw in a doctor talking about physical signs of abuse, perhaps to justify the film's point of view: that two four-year-olds never do "things like this". Well, they want, if every adult they know, asks them. The way this piece supports such discredited interrogation techniques makes it a frustrating exercise for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful trial in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest warrant to the end to "prove" their case - no parallel to this fictional event has ever taken place in real life. Can't say more here without making it a spoiler, but you know it when you see it. <br /> <br /> Yes, children are being abused, sometimes by paid carers. But to see a movie confirming the ridiculous, hysterical accusations against so many innocent people, to see the restorations of the trials that destroyed the lives of many countless children as well as the lives of the accused - I didn't think I would last until the end . It's just too sad, and it's more of the writing team's apparent approval of the violent, paranoid, coercive techniques that started - what can we call it? Sanitary fire? <br /> <br /> No one I know has ever been charged with child abuse, thank you sky, but my 12-times-over-grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it. Mobs filled with what they think is sacred anger is just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago. Sensational drift like this - "These accusations of satanic abuse are cutting across the country, there must be something there!" "So tell the jury!" - just put them on. <br /> <br /> And who thought it was a good idea to have children under 10, some of them under five, play these roles? It is traumatic to see them deliver their lines; How much more traumatic was trading these parts? The filmmakers' commitment to combating child abuse does not seem to apply to themselves. And what were the children's actors' parents thinking? "Melinda" (uncredited, at least in the A&E Network version in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) was great. Professional or not, even though they were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to be paid to do it. Despite the ruthless exploitation of these real children, "Muffin Man" got an Emmy nomination to govern - which just shows how ugly things were left in 1989.
