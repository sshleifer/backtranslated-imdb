Other than John Krasinski, this movie was horrible. Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan's love story were as clichéd as possible, filled with incredibly bad lines of how her parents would never let them be together and super-hammy longing looks. None of the "emotions" had any depth or reality at all. The two accented characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and who it was to play the pistol expert) .... when they saw how little the accents were, they could not have decided to just drop them and rewrite a few lines to avoid giving the audience headache? Apparently not. I don't even know where to start editing, especially audio editing. If you obviously hate over-dubbing as much as I do, don't see this. That said, Krasinski was great. By the bat, I admit that I am a great office fan and therefore I rented this. But he is quite entertaining as the "outside wall friend with crazy ideas". He has a clichéd role, but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. The finish was horrible. Just flattened out terribly. The idea of ​​the robbery that had gone wrong had potential, but Keegan floated around after being shot, all the way to his studio to fall out of a painting by Chabert (who doesn't look like her) is the most cringe-worthy scene.
