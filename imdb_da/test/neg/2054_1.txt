I rented this movie today ... worst movie ever. It was a total waste of time and a horrible story. The action was horrible, especially by the actor "Sai". She was so bad it was ridiculous. I can't tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just as stupid at first. I can't even get my mind wrapped around just how horrible and pointless this movie was. I'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good Vampire / Horror flick .. this is not the movie for you. Move right together! It's a waste of time and money. Heck, I wouldn't even DOWNLOAD this movie if anyone paid me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it doesn't even deserve a "1". I wish I could give it a "0"!
