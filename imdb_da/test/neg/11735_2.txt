Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to restore Psycho in color so that he could bring it to modern audiences who would likely go to heart if they were ever forced to watch a black and white movie while conveniently forgetting that Both "Clerks" and "Schindler's List" were filmed in black and white and are great movies. Unfortunately, the same smart minded people who do not want to watch a good movie just because it is in black & white are the same people who will not like "Psycho" anyway because it does not have a murder or sex scene every other minute. And the murders aren't the pig's blood / guts / gore / bone-snapping that people are used to from seeing "Halloween", "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street." That's why remaking "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally intended not to work, because it is only of interest to people who are fans of the original. Everyone else just looks at it to tune them over until the next "Scream" sequel comes out and therefore they are disappointed. "Psycho" is dependent on excitement and mystery, not blood and gut. (And just as no one thinks I should be seniors, if I like older movies, let me put the plate right by saying that I am 21.) <br /> <br /> So if you made the movie in color , was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not color the film and relay it? I mean, what is the point of remake a movie if you don't want to change * something *? The least he could have done was to put his own director's spin on it, rather than just copying Hitchcocks - or even better hired a new author to customize a new script from the original "Psycho" book. But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether he wanted to recreate "Psycho" * exactly * or not. This should have been a whole or no project - either replay the movie exactly or do it differently - but as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few handpieces it didn't seem to have any purpose. Like having Norman masturbate while spying on Marion's dress. It doesn't serve the plot at all, and the only reason he put it in was because he * could *. He would say, "Hitch couldn't show people masturbating in 1960, so I'll do it." Whoopee, the big deal I am so shocked to see anyone masturbate. And what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and domestic animals spliced ​​into murder scenes? And then he * leaves * an important scene where Lila and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Plus, using the almost exactly the same script, the whole movie looks like an anachronism. The opening credits say that the year is 1998. So what about Marion's 60-year dress or parasol she is carrying with her? Why should Marion and Sam have their trysts in a hotel room as these days no one would be shocked at what they were doing? Why is there no air conditioning in Marion's office? Why doesn't the Bates Motel have any TVs in the rooms, and apparently no automatic locks on the doors? Why should the sheriff ask the operator to connect him to Bates motel? That's why using the exact same script was a mistake - just changing a few words here and there wasn't enough to modernize it. It needed a complete rework. <br /> <br /> While Vince Vaughn made a good performance as Norman, he just didn't really think that part. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so eerie was that Norman had the innocent, boys-next door quality, so no one could believe he was capable of such terrible crimes. When Vince Vaughn plays the game, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> Having said that, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original "Psycho" movie and wished this is a tribute. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that this may be some people's only exposure to "Psycho". I really think you should only watch this movie if you have seen the original. Since I am a fan of something to do with "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake that I can see occasionally. The original movie was a filet mignon while remake is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would be boring if you had it every day, so it's nice to have a hamburger once in a while, for a change.
