Cheaply pieced together by recycled films, music and ideas, this movie can't really be called "good". But for me, when I saw it as a teenager, it was very funny. (I didn't know BATTLE STARS before.) In retrospect, it's got something nostalgic about the SF wave from the early eighties and the special effects of this time. The bad old-fashioned look and its naivety give some attraction. To enjoy this movie I recommend concentrating on the paternity relationship between the characters Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. In addition, I liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discover their heroic qualities after being unwillingly faced with the challenge of taking care of a child.
