Finally. Here is a movie that does so much for the Greek and Russian men's reputation as "Gigli" for those of Mr. Affleck and Mrs Lo. From the city's district details, the sad and horrific lives of some young Russian emigrants living in and around Athens, spending their time breaking in cars, lying down, sneaking female emigrants and prostitutes themselves ("But we are not gay because of we don't. You don't know that ... and if we do, it's only once or twice. With the same guy. ") There's almost nothing here you haven't seen before and better; Only Athens locale adds a little news - even then there is only one scene or two that are scenic. Writer / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 Steps to Heaven") offers a relatively generic 95 minutes where the standout moments involve how stupid, sexist and (from the appearance of things) pretty much irreversible most of these guys are. (Interestingly, the gayer guy, the more redeemable he looks.) What really matters is the treatment of the women. Greek and Russian men seem to give the Italians a run for their money for the famous madonna / horn complex. Has life in Greece improved much for women since Plato and Socrates? You have to wonder. <br /> <br /> If I seem to be equal to Russians and Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even the non-migrants pictured here (eg, the cab owner) are creeping. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit on its home market) was actually submitted by Greece for an Oscar for best foreign film. What this says about the state of Greek film production, I hesitate to consider.
