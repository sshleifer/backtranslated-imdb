Just watched the movie tonight in an example and it's just a movie for kids. It does not improve or add to the original Disney movie in any way. There is a corny Scottish pastiche style all the way through, not helped by weak writing (where motifs are lumpy in spade) and plays that are uneven and often unengaging (despite what looks like a decent cast). I have no problem with the bad dog - although there is a certain "Skippy Bush Kangaroo" (see below) quality about his shot. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was an Australian children's television series from the 1960s, where the kangaroo would be a major part of all the stories. It is said that to get poor old Skippy to "act" they stuck an elastic band around his nose, then he tried to get rid of his paws - apparently communicating with the human actors !!! Bobby has a similar range and you just don't buy his series of heroic rescues at all. Counseling would be to take children aged 8-12. Below they may be scared. Over it, if they or you love it, good luck to you, but this is strictly cardboard-cut film making for the indispensable. It is a missed opportunity as there is true pathos and cuteness in Bobby's history and this movie fails to deliver it.
