That's what I kept asking myself while watching this movie. I mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the movie that gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of history. Really I just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but I continued. I continued in the hope that perhaps the story would be better that there might be a good twist in the end. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Eventually I held on because I figured I could write a bad review for it if it was something after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I don't think I have anything wrong, there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the instructor only shows it with a shitty story, it thinks what the viewer wants see it offend us all. To think that we are all so superficial that we only want to see burlesque from rep-ratable, big movie industry players are upscale. My advice: Rent another movie.
