I am only registered with IMDb for the purpose of warning others about this movie. Hwo does anyone ever get funding for projects like this? That's the mystery. Goodbye to Harry may be the worst movie ever, except that I tried to delete the others competing with this dazzling idioci. Poor plot, non-credible logic runs all the way through. I can't spoil this movie for you by revealing something that would make your experience less enjoyable. There is nothing comfortable with this movie. I have the CD and send it free to you, it's so bad. First comes only served. If I know you, this offer is void because I would not inflict this film on anyone, not on purpose. YOU ARE WARNED.
