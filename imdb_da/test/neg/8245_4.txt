I shave my brain, but I can't seem to think of another movie similar to The Valley of the Gwangi. A western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You must wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> The reason ?? While looking for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the cast / characters come into a strange, lost valley. There they find not only the little horse, but also other, more terrible creatures. Dinosaurs rule this place. Now it would not be an attraction on the TJ's circus ?? a caged T-Rex? <br /> <br /> It's not that I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie, I just don't seem to have had it as much as many others who have commented on the movie. There are some parts that I actually find virtually unavailable. For the first half of the movie, it doesn't seem to be much going on. I wasn't necessarily bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plumbing would be an adjective I would use. To top it off, the film has a very confidential love story. It feels compelled as if the authors decided that male and female leaders just had to come together. But the Gwangi Valley is not a total waste. There are moments I really enjoyed. Who does not get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback and tries to lasso a T-Rex. You just can't see such things everyday. Ray Harryhausen's creatures are impressive. There are some really nice pictures of Harryhausen's miniatures that interact with people and horses. It may not represent the best of his work, but the effects are great. Nevertheless, these good moments are certainly not enough to overcome the negatives. As much as I hate to do so, I have to judge The Valley of the Gwangi a 4/10.
