I suppose only a select number of members of the audience really had any interest in seeing how a male hustler in New York works, but I would be willing to bet that even these brave souls were interrupted by the annoying patchwork technology and deliberately silent sound recording here, the fact that these inherent "defects" were a direct result of the film's low-budget / underground / experimental character, is what I would say next to that point. Anyway, for those so inclined, the movie has extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandably, became an underground ?? and gay ?? icon! <br/> <br /> The episodic structure showing the daily routine of the hustler protagonist offers a few mildly interesting scenes: his encounter with (and ultimately constitutes) an eccentric older artist; the one in which Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual work style and defines his particular modus operandi to a few potential "colleagues", including perhaps the most unlikely of hustlers? a strange geek! Perhaps mercilessly, the movie ran for just 89 minutes against IMDb's claim that its full length is 105 (but the latter might be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I had seen a few others of Warhol's 'movie' and this one is certainly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example I've ever entered, BAD (1977) and just a little better than it can like MY HUSTLER (1965), which was mostly a load to sit through. The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy was not good enough, but as you say, you must do what you have to do and the other two chapters must follow in quick succession ... <br /> <br /> Despite my generally negative reaction to it, FLESH is nevertheless valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era, both cinematic and in reality. For the record, an image of Dallesandro from this movie adorns the The Smiths' self-proclaimed 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling (which appears quite unremarkably here) was immortalized in "Candy Says", the opening of The Velvet Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Although the latter band is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their unique and groundbreaking music, they describe a way of life that is completely different from my own; D very little experience something aurally instead of visually!
