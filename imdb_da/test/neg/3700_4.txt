"Haaaarrrryyy!" The reinforced, eerie female voice could have been Leona Helmseley in heat, but no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the 50-foot Woman of the title. In the film's most infamous role, Allison's performance literally runs out of the roof. In fact, it does take a few moments. <br /> <br /> Stifling, "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, a neurotic, boozy heir and his beloved Lothario man, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred against The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter of the third kind in the desert with a bald giant from outer space wearing a mini skirt and gladiator sandals, and who has something for Nancy's jewelry. What he does to her when he has carried her out is probably best to be a mystery, but soon Nancy is beginning to grow. <br /> <br /> Treading into the center of the city with tranquilizers, wrapped in nothing but sheets, the Buxom giant is heading towards the low-rise rental lounge where Harry has a few laughs with a floozy named Honey (Yvette Vickers ). The confrontation becomes ugly. The poverty line f / x makes the alien giant and Nancy seem transparent because of incompetent transposed images. You understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz on the credits. Juran was no stranger to controlling giant beings, humans and not, who also directed "The Deadly Mantis", "Sinbad's Seventh Journey", "Jack, the Giant Killer" and several episodes of TV's "World of Giants" and "Land of the Jews. "<br /> A lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons.
