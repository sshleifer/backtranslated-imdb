I have never figured out what Karen Black's attraction was. She always had the beige eyes and kind of a strange look about her. She often seemed to be eccentric or tossed as "another" woman. In this one, she is the psychic counselor and expert on the occult to a crummy producer of bad advertisements as he learns astral projection. He is an average sucker, even without the new luggage. Apparently, this is the way to immortality, because if you do well, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I think Star Trek had a plot like this with Jack the Ripper hanging on for several centuries. Anyway, this guy is really dangerous. He has a lovely family and makes them miserable. He starts killing friends just because they have an inappropriate comment on them, or he doesn't like them. You can see the end coming from the back in the left field. It's a very hard, humorous movie. Most of it must be taken as truth. Why are some called but few selected? I found it long and not very satisfying.
