The worst movie I've ever seen. The sound quality was poor, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logical, and it had no speed ... I first learned: "Oh no, I do not want the track proving that poor Patrick was an innocent killer ". But it turned out even worse. Typically in this American movie you get a supertips or no tip at all. I want very little small tips that lead you to the killer. The audience is not involved. And now that I don't get any tips at all, you can expect a more 's / he-is-the-killers' sweeps in the end. And that's not all. ah ... This is hopeless, let's put it to an end ... <br /> <br /> In a word: Disgusting .. <br /> <br />
