I usually like movies about animals or reptiles facing the medieval people who threaten their surroundings, but I have to say that Snake Island was a big downfall. The premise is interesting, a group of people, including a writer who is numbly played by William Katt, goes to an island called, duh, you guessed it "Snake Island" and ask how the island lives up to that name. That's one thing I want to give this movie, snakes, LOTS and lots of snakes of all sizes and kinds. So the part of the film in justice lives up to its name, but writing, acting and controlling is the SOOOOOOOO lame it is almost painful to sit through. <br /> <br /> The characters are so odd, I prayed for the snakes to end these horrible people to put us all out of our misery. There are a few scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that they are thought to be believed --- snakes gyrates for really horrible disco music, while 2 women dance together and a scene with a snake holding an inactive dialogue with one of the actors, it is beyond absurd. I think the author tried to be fun, but it just came as a strange LSD trip ... I remember William Cat many years ago when he starred in "Carrie" what a hunk was he? .. not that he was ever a big star, but to be reduced to this waste, I feel for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague unless you're really into movies that contain lots of snakes and really horrible people.
