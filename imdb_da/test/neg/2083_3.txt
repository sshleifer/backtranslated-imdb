Watchable but pretty terrible. How shocking that this was the great Gregory La Cava's last director's credit! Even in his better known roles, I don't care about Gene Kelly. He seems to be virtuous, hostile and self-involved. Here, along with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, he appears to show these characteristics in spades. Marie Wilson, who plays an heir who falls for a military man, is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic. The actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard, uncomfortable core of the picture, and they are okay. The know-it-all butler is supposed to be fun, but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits that Franklin Pangborn was famous for (and despite his stereotypes, he was generally fun - unlike this guy. ) As always, Phyllis Thaxter is very appealing in a slightly underdeveloped secondary plot.
