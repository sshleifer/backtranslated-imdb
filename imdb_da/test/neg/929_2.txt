Is this a game of FMV or a movie? In honesty, I saw this out of "choice-less-ness". It's a very big waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that HK movies are moving in the opposite direction of the rest of the world. Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us look, rather than something you want us to see. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so horrible that they looked like something from the early to mid-90s low resolution games (compared to today's ones). How they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90's Wing Commander game, the third series of the series. Stop regressing and make us Asian look so bad compared to the big guns in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Safe! They have big budgets and better players. But we have some of the oldest stories, myths and legends, the best techno files and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world! So what went so very wrong? Have you started using the same old companies that have worked with you for so many movies? Please stop wasting our time and money. This is why HK movies are going downhill so quickly. Didn't you mean to be Orient's Hollywood? Apparently not.
