Marlene Dietrich is magnificent as Concha Perez, the sanctuary who drives all men into despair in Josef von Sternberg's "The Devil is a Woman". Her performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any conventional sense, but she is glowing, a true star in full command of her material. But she's the only good thing about the movie (she's so good, she keeps you looking at this dross; I doubt if another actress could have done the same). The story is a horrible crippling melodrama (surely Louise's novel was better), where Dietrich's amorous Concha destroys two friends played by Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero, with a stiffness bordering on evaporation. And for Von Sternberg it is an ugly looking movie, (perhaps in line with its rather ugly subject). Bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough to recreate it as "the obscure object of desire" with more emphasis on the surreal aspects of it all, down to encountering two different actresses in the same role. Neither film is either the director's finest hour, and while the Bunuel version is perhaps the better movie, it is Dietrich's 'performance' that you remember.
