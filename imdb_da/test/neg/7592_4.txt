"The Damned House" (also known as "Specter") is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks, filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. It's about a family that inherits an old Irish mansion, and after moving in, begins to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly perceptions, including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the cellar's cellar. The couple's young daughter is then whisked away in another dimension, and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. <br /> <br /> The ideas this movie borrowed from the 1982 haunted film "Poltergeist" is obvious. I would say that this movie has some scary sequences, but sometimes it is very boring. The action here is nothing special, the mood is okay, the score (which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying, and the CGI special effects are really terrible. I mean, it was 1996, you'd think they could have done a little better than they did. The end, where the house was on fire, was the least special effect I have seen, very very cheap. But hey, it was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks terribly fake. And what was the meaning of the movie anyway? What is a wolf monster that has to do with a haunted house? The special effects here are what really destroyed this movie. The action was also pretty bad. I usually enjoy many low budget horror movies, but not this one. "The Damned House" is nothing special at all, just consider seeing it if you have nothing better to do. But you would probably like to pass it on. 10.4.
