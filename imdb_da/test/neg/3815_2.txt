An awful movie amateurish at almost every level - a boring and derived manuscript filled with stereotypical characters played by indifferent actors to an instructor who lacks the most rudimentary understanding of his craft. It all stinks. It plays like a slasher movie from the early eighties, down to crappy scores and ketchup SFX, but without childhood nostalgia that has to look good on such dross. One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen - absolutely the worst that received a mainstream theater release. I have never gone out of a movie in my life - had I been unlucky to see 'Hatchet' in the theater, it would have been a first. Avoid at all costs.
