After watching this movie, I decided it was so horrible that I was joining IMDb and writing a review to warn other people in the pitfalls by renting / buying this movie. To be fair to the movie, there is only one good section for this movie, and it's the final credits because you know that this bush is good and really over. I finally saw it in the hope that I could get some joy out of the movie. Just tunnels several tunnels and an old man who speaks to himself (If you see this movie too many times, then you will). As for Val, if he continues to choose films like this, he can also kiss goodbye to his acting career. There is no point in writing about what is in the movie as it has already been done. Keep your money and sanity and stay clear.
