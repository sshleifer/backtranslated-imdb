"Ashes of Time" was a monstrous project, but ended up being a pretentious movie. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The "Ashes Time" card is quite simple and comes down to two words: "Love triangle". Because of these "love triangles" that cross stories, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics shown by the characters. The narrative part is seen through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-Yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as an intermediary to various swords and becomes Destiny's tool through which revenge is achieved. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" fails to tell these simple stories of love and hatred. Wong Kar-wai was driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact, besides the casting of beautiful actors (men and women), everything else is a failure in this movie. Dialogues are minimalist and not at all original. The image quality is very uneven, editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least by me) in the "swordplay" genre and finally the recording of the rare sword battle is very confusing and unpleasant. Even the attempt to build artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so-called erotic "women on a horse" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver a 100 minute pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a movie is about how a plot is told. By forgetting that he is delivering an awkward movie that does not even meet his artistic goal.
