Really horrible. Of course, an attempt to redeem at Star Wars craze, but there is no excuse for this scary piece of waste. The story is lost before the middle, the characters are forgettable and the child is such a non-talent that everything he does stands for the camera. An alien planet they land on is actually Navy Stockyards in Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie actually made me physically ill to see it. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman made some good, some bad movies in his career, but there is no excuse for this. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb won't let you score a zero.
