Carlos Mencia is not fun. From his stand up specials to this, the wreck of a television series, Carlos Mencia is not fun. I have been trying to convince people for two years that he is stealing other comedians' jokes, and as far as his comedy material is concerned, he is a regular "Johnny-come-lately" with far less than partial results. Psycho astronaut jokes? Britney Spears breakdown jokes? I hope this is just a planning error, but come on Carlos and Comedy Central, the topics, and many others, have run the gamut of bedside night show hosted opening monologues, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many many others. Lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes? Comedy stands no chance of developing with Carlos Mencia. Perhaps people, especially viewers and Comedy Central leaders, will get the point since this week's edition of the "New York" magazine accurately felt him: "Carlos Mencia, unjustified joke films."
