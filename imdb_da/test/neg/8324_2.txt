(This review is based on the English version) <br /> <br /> Orson Welles' legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. It should have been back as such, not thrown together in this clumsy, boring collection of the material that was available. <br /> <br /> Although I am sure it was done with the best intentions, the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to Welle's vision, they have also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version on the audience. <br /> <br /> The first one that hits the viewer is the sound effect of sound. Not only are the newly-doubled voices rather bad ideas, they are also inconsistent - Welles' original recordings (with his own voice, which he often did) have been preserved in a handful of scenes, and they do not respond at all. There has not been the slightest attempt at consistency. In addition, it sounds like an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimum of sound effects and atmospheric sequences during a huge festival (including the bulls' race), as it was recorded in an abandoned suburban street with about three people the sound of a crowd that is supposed to be in thousands. <br /> <br /> The real problem, however, is the inevitable fact that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete and it is clearly visible. The film consists of a handful of scenes stretched together and pulled out to ridiculous lengths just to compensate for the running time. The point in point - the order in which Sancho is searching for Don Quixote in the city continues forever. It's just Sancho who approaches people in the crowd, asks them the same questions over and over again - there's no way Welles could ever use every single tag in its entirety, but that's what is shown here. It lasts more than twelve minutes, as in fact it would probably last approx. two minutes absolute maximum in a properly finished version of the movie. <br /> <br /> While the start of the movie is relatively complete and quite well finished, the rest has massive holes that simply cannot be filled with endless superimposition of the Spanish landscape and ever more shots of Don Quixote & Sancho going back and forth . There is also no end. Although there are material in private collections that were not available to the filmmakers, it could not be done what would be necessary to make this a complete, coherent work. Welles simply did not quit shooting, mainly due to the fact that his main actor died before they could finish. <br /> <br /> But to put aside the fact that it was not complete and could never be one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that could have been would be enough . Unfortunately, by putting it together in such a way, one is left with a very negative impression of the film in general. What was clearly a great achievement from Akim Tamiroff as Sancho is completely destroyed by the new voice and with long drawn-out scenes that ultimately make him just annoying. Orson Welle's vision for this movie was something far more ambitious and complex than a simple story of Don Quixote's story, but that's what has been tried here, and as such, the point is lost. The only one who could have gathered all the material into something worthwhile would have been Welles himself, and he didn't. <br /> <br /> The recordings could have been much better used in a documentary chronicle throughout the saga of Welles trying to make the film. Welles himself came up with the perfect title for such a doco: "When should you quit Don Quixote?"
