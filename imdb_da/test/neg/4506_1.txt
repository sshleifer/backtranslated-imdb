I actually saw THE EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a dual function in the early 1980s (can't remember the other movie) when I was in my middle of teens. The film is bad, cringe-worthy of bad. Terribly bad. The effects are terrible (you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl over the floor). There is absolutely nothing scary about it. I actually made the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story was trying to create this great structure for the climax when we suppose to finally see who is responsible for all the evil goods and we see the odd Victor Buono who is as scary as an overstuffed Twinkie. Seriously, what are they thinking about? Buono, who was a villain on the Batman TV series, is one of the hammest actors ever to reach the big screen, and I just can't imagine anyone being extremely afraid of him. <br /> <br /> EVIL is all but forgotten Now (for good reason), but it's actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see this turkey again just to see that the black girl was pulled over the room by an invisible force with the very visible cable.
