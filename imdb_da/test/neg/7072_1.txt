OK, fans, it's out on DVD. But the only reason to see this is 1) to say you did (because of its infamy), or 2) if you're a hardcore Bill Paxton fan. I'm not a hardcore BP fan, but he was fun to watch, and that was the only thing that kept me from beating it out of sheer boredom. It's a shame because it could have been a good movie with some scripting work and if it was made by someone with a bit of intelligence (and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and unscrupulous Judd Nelson). Sure it's gross, but it's bad and not in a good way. If after reading all the comments about how bizarre outrageous and dystopian filthy this movie is, you are still interested, do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre outrageous dystopian filth instead. Movies by John Waters, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Basket Case", etc. Will all think about. There is much better out there.
