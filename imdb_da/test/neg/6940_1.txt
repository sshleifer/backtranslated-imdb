I never thought a movie could make me regret subscribing to the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but he couldn't even save this part. Not what he tried. Jack plays his regular Eastwick Wiitches type character. Unfortunately, it does not transfer to the US southwest. He is so trustworthy a cowboy desperate as Pee Wee Herman. There is no edge to the performance, and therefore the comedy beats mistakes. He is almost foggy. The rest of the molding was worse. Timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected from 1978, and the others seemed to be just happy to be there. My recommendation to those of you interested in watching this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry.
