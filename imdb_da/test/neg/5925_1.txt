An example of all the worst gay stereotypes in a movie. <br /> <br /> And why, Charles, are you talking in the weird pseudo British / High Brown accent, and insist that the child also speaks that way? Have others noticed that all the soundtrack musicians are exactly the same? You must stick to the good old Hollywood camp drag stuff you're so good at! The Mommy The II, Sequel !! I don't see the value of spending time and money on a project like this; There are so many real life gay stories to be told and we should see them, not this garbage. Sheesh, what a waste of time. Captivating example of gay.
