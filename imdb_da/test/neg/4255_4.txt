Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has made a comment so far and covers the most important points for the movie. You are again another difficult movie to buy in the UK. I had to go through "Midnight Video", which has a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title of only SKR30 a title. <br /> <br /> This movie goes under many "aka's" depending on when and where it is marketed. I had previously purchased "Bloodsucker leads the dance" (which you find if you search on Imdb under "people" and enter "Krista Nell"). The actor, who plays Count on his private island in the latter film, had his words called from Italian to English by an actor with an unmistakably grieving voice. I smiled when I heard the same voice header on the English soundtrack as police inspector examining the murder of the prostitute killed in the cops in the film. Of course, my choice was to see another excursion at the Kristian Nell. <br /> <br /> There are quite a few insignificant subtypes in the movie that include blackmail / blackmail, cunning affair with sweetheart mothers, a motorcycle hunt that results in a gangland hit, a gangrape of a "client's" motorcycle friend , blurry photography, cross dressing with transvestites, etc. which gives a taste to this movie summed up in one word - SLEAZE (but artistic sleaze). The aforementioned contributor liked this movie, but the low rating suggests that other Imdb fans did not do so without explaining their "wheres and whyfores". Personally, I thought there were too many subplots and not enough put in the main story and the relationship between these subordinate characters to the central plot and the evolution of their screen characters. Also, a professional movie editor was much needed as some of the scenes seemed to last too long, having made their points, so the movie seemed to draw in places; eg. dance transvestite scene. Krista Nell appears in a fruity scene with a client, but it is also a vignette, and I was left more by her, the director and the manuscript. <br /> <br /> I love Political Incorporation shown in older movies (it's 30 years since it was made) eg smoking in offices and the way some characters respond to each other in the office! I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic assessment and I have assigned it as such.
