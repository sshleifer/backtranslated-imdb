"The Final Comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and inner city violence; Unfortunately, the message has been invalidated by the incomparable script, the amateur-effective production and the heavy devoted controversy. How heavy-handed you ask? To give you one example, a black doctor comes out of his hiding place, unarmed, with his hands up in the air, ready to surrender to the police: One of the (white) police says "Don't shoot him, he's a doctor" As another policeman replies, "So what? He's still a **** r" and continues to shoot him in cold blood. The police are portrayed as ignorant, racist killed, although at the end there are as many dead people among those who are among the black people who staged the uprising. And this whole event was somehow meant to "sensitize" the white people to the weaker treatment of the black people when, in fact, something like this can only raise more hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, as Williams' boyfriend, shines briefly on the screen with her smile and body, especially in a sore sex scene, raising the score of this movie from 1 to 2 in 10.
