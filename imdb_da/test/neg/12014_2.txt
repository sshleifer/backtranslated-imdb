The only good that was caused by the Problem Child films was to bring together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Apart from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, the freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser move Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen time ever) to a new city affected by willing bachelor rights. Ben eventually selects Lawanda (played by the most underutilized original SNLs Laraine Newman) whose Blanche DuBois trends do not fit Junior at least. To add to the junior's torture, it already seems to have a small four-star in the younger girl form with Trixie, who randomly has a cute, single mother, played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played Junior's first horrible mother-through adoption. You can see where the plot goes from here. Looking for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I think I will go with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" gag, which makes Back to the Future James Tolkan one of the many adult victims (the guy always plays school authority numbers). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as their parts from the first movie, but unfortunately there is no appearance from Bow-tie Klansmaer, I mean Killer (Michael Richards) who made Problem Child even more fun. In a serious note, I'm sure these movies, whether violent parents saw them or no, did wonders for the red-haired kids in America. Let us also welcome these proud American flicks for their amazing promotion of adoption. Oh, and puppy jokes - must have dog poop jokes .... Shmucks.
