I can't believe I saw this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" knows that I was waiting to get better, which never happened. The sound is horrible, goes from too low to hear the conversations, to browse the sound in seconds. The reason is absolutely unlikely, the play is mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good work as a mental case, although becoming typecast in that role can certainly be considered a negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medicine, science or anything of a technical nature. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they came up with that diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, goofs and things that are wrong with this movie that if you were to list them all, it might put some kind of record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? A motorcycle on the highway with a non-DOT / Snell off-road helmet. San Francisco ??? The paper walls move as they are drained, helmets appear straight out of thin air, guns point in one direction, but strike things in another, light appears and disappears, and there is hardly a scene in the movement that does not contain any kind of error . My wife, who is an RN in an Oncology unit, left the room locally before the end of the movie, so disturbed all the medical errors. I gave it a 2 only because of Keaton's action, otherwise it would certainly have got a 1.
