As a total movie geek with the lucky job of video great manager, I tend to see all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing a lot before I turned it off after 30-40 minutes. The movie "The Creature Feature" movie has released some rather horrible things over the past few years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), But this movie makes me believe that the creators didn't even try. It might be worth checking out just for "making fun of me" potential (count the sliders!), But I could not in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.
