-SILILER ------------ I'm a fan of the 60's-70's French cinema, but not necessarily of the more modern, so honest I saw this because of Bellucci. She is very young here, extremely beautiful and on top of this probably this film, where they met with Cassel, so it gives it some extra importance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of DePalma. So suddenly we are thrown to the flashback, and back and forth who gets tiring.I don't mind a flash back but do it and get it over with man !!! Still, the film is still interesting to me until a time when the first and definite hole in the plot that allows for the rest of the story never lets me enjoy the rest. I can allow small holes here and there, but not to base a whole plot on hot air. This is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame. This is the main plot. I want to go together when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on, but in th's story there is nothing really mysterious. Bellucci-Cassel is a couple, so Bellucci has to leave some work in Italy (not the farthest place on earth from Paris), and she leaves him a message, which, for reasons later explained, he doesn't get. , so what? Don't these people have phones? Probably she was away in 2months (not a century exactly) and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in Paris to see how he was doing? Of course not. Instead, even after she comes back, she forgets about him. And that's fine, but later in the film she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life. she failed to call 2months and then he never tried to come back with him. And what about Cassel's character? He might not find her in Italy, really hard to find anyone in Italy, it's probably like Siberia, especially an actress who is probably listed even in the art papers. And after 2months when she would be back, really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. You think she would avoid him, but no, we find that they simply could not meet. So hard to meet in Paris. OK, I don't have to go any further, because this is the event where the whole movie is based. What's even worse, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but this other girl Bohringer is.
