Mixing small town sheriffs, high school students, fake rock music, and some weirdo kills for, no reason especially, this movie is essentially a re-make of "The Giant Gila Monster" - except without the gila monster, of course. Anyone who has actually seen the "Giant Gila Monster" knows that it is one of the worst movies all the time, often so slow, it's not even fun. And I can't believe that "Giant Gila Monster" in 1967 had received such a reputation that young directors were just dying to come to work with a sequel, let alone a remake. Then someone will kindly explain to me why this movie was made? The dance sequence is, by the way, historically interesting, but in three years outdated; but even that is spoiled as it continues ... and on ... and ... on ....
