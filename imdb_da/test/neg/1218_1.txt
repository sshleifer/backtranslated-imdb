This is the worst Italian movie ever, possibly the worst movie all the time! Joe D'Amato is of course not a cinematic genius, but many of his films are interesting and visible. Unfortunately, it is not one of them. It is cheesy and boring .... waaaaay boring. If you want a movie for MST3k, get Troll 2 if you want a movie to put someone in a coma, get deep blood!
