I love most Jet Li movies (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a very cheap three-pack with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". While the Twin Warriors were very impressive and I was thoroughly fascinated by it and the gentleman was a bit "Karate Kid" but also funny, I thought this movie was horrible. I'm not just saying that because I'm used to better movies. I say it was almost down with "Kazaam". The battle scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". If you want to get a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into a woman to become generous and so in love with Jet Li') you have some good matches to go with it. If you're looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you hire "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Kids from Shaolin).
