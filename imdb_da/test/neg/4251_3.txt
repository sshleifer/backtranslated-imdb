A family of dirt farmers are moving out to the west. <br /> <br /> The head of Walnut Grove's latest fashion bridge is named 'Charles'. He works at the mill and misses lots of timber, but who in the hell does he think cutting all that forest is a mystery, because none of the people in the whole township have enough money to buy a splinter, much less a two-city - four. <br /> <br /> Running the city is 'Olsons', a rich but stupid clan who moved to these parts to rake in all the dough they make to sell eggs to eleven cents a dozen. They have two children, a boy, 'Willie' and a girl, 'Nellie', who between them only has one saving asset ... Nellie is warm and it's fun to spy on her when she takes a bath in cricket. <br /> <br /> The town priest is also the village idiot because he thinks he really is something special for this backwoods covey of dillweeds when in reality they cannot stand their dull sermons and all they are praying for on Sunday is it for him to fall from the nearest rock as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The caravan is a dinosaur that saw its better days about 20 years ago, but he is still hanging so he can provide free breast examinations to the old hags living in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these old hot dogs come down on their knees is to pull a loaf out of the oven to give Doc his services. But it's okay with Doc because he knows that these old wencher give good bread. <br /> <br /> Getting behind on this colorful collection of cow chips is Charles 'wimpy wife Carolyn' and their three girls, 'Mary', 'Carrie' and 'Half-Pint'. Mary is another hot chick who all guys sneak a look at when she's taking a shower or a crap. Carrie is an annoying baby, but keep a cake in her mouth, and you don't even know she's there, in fact, where is she? ... here she is ... she goes to the farm with a packet of cigarettes ... how sweet! Half-Pint is the city's youngest screwdriver. She must not have a brain or any body to talk about, but she can spit longer than any boy throughout the freaking school. It is a wonderful town, Walnut Grove, where there is always someone falling from a roof or driving over by a wagon wheel and it is also beautifully composed of a building ... the church / school house / town hall / pool room. Oh, it gets a little hair on the prairie, but it's okay, especially when Mary takes a bath in cricket ... that's when you can see where the hair really is.
