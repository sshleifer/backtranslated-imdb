Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, TÃ©a Leoni) quit unemployment when the company Dick works for, is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperate and unsuccessful attempts to find jobs, the duo becomes a crime to get them out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been a while since he made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty, who was pretty good. He has proven that he can make serious dramas, but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane shows that he still has it. Although the movie was fun, it was still a little disappointing. It wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be. It is worth seeing once, but unlike most of Carrey's films, it does not have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the manuscript was weak, as it is the same guy who made The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be too hard. If Jim Carrey wasn't in it, the movie would have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Tea Leoni. She's an okay actress, but she's just not much fun. She didn't fit well with Carrey, and she seemed to call her performance. They should have been with someone else. The support cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he actually gives a decent performance. He wasn't as annoying as most children's stars are. Alec Baldwin was okay, and Richard Jenkins was trying too hard to be fun. To be honest I am a little bias here. The movie was quite average, but I liked it more because of Jim Carry's performance. Fans of Jim Carrey should enjoy it, but it's about it. Eventually, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not very memorable. Rating 6/10
