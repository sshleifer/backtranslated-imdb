Recently, I borrowed a copy of this mess from a movie that took me three sessions over three days to get through. This is another comment in the presentation. <br /> <br /> But what I first wanted to comment on was the carelessness of the DVD's special features. It included a game of memory that asks the player / viewer to match up pairs of animals so that they can get on the table in the ark. But each time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen asks the player to find (or congratulate the player on finding) "it's mate." This is a spelling error, as it must be "its mate" as possessing pronoun, not a contraction for "it is". Repeating 16 or more times to end a game is an annoying mistake. Of course, it's a children's activity really, but teaches children incorrect spelling. <br /> <br /> And, oh yes, the game never changes. It is the same game every time with the same location of the same animals. Plus it doesn't hold points like the number of moves it took to solve the game. So there is no lasting value or challenge for it. It's just a feature to list on the packaging. Simply put, there could have been more thought and care put into this "special" feature, as there might have been more thought and care put into this muddled movie.
