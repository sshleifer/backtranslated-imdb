This movie made me laugh, but that doesn't mean it was fun. Occasionally I and my friends had fun watching it. <br /> <br /> I doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. All the characters are used over filmclich√© cardboard boxes, which do not even require acting skills; Therefore, such skills are not provided. We have the corrupt policeman, a ruthless killer who claims to worry about his men and their families, while they don't care about people he shoots in such a row as to get the blood spit on his face. We have the "worn out policeman on the edge" as nicely pointed out in the discussion board of this movie; We have the old one-day-away-from-retirement policeman who almost everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside when he had the most to win, and he didn't give a credible word through the film. About as transparent as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all the former big black gangster kings in film history (they might just have called him Marcellus Wallace), but just a little harder and more ruthless because something has to emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne from actually good movie. Then we finally have the highly-developed physician who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation is different from her ordinary life, and who uses the majority of the movie sitting in a corner, tries helplessly to find out how to stick to the weapon she got. DO NOT USE IT. <br /> <br /> The entire siege story is not interesting, not original (has been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it. There is the initial probe, so the coating of the siege then attacked, so try the escape. Meanwhile, a bunch of relaxed, stressed, freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the quite important advantage of VISION. Then again, in deep night, with the power outage and with a blizzard that rages overhead, there is certainly a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best comes right at the end. In the first scenes showing Precinct 13, we see it lying on the edge of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From this point, the besieged walk is perhaps a hundred meters in the sewer and where do they end? Some alleys are right in the middle of a forest! A FOREST! Where did that forest come from? Who decided to put a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest in the last scene suddenly on a hill above that city, while in the actors in the woods it so wildly flat? <br /> <br /> From here I leave judgment to you and to your common sense. Go see this movie, if you're looking for an unintentional good laugh, I can really recommend it.
