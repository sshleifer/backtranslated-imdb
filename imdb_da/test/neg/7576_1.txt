One of my colleagues recommended this, which meant it was one of the most scary movies she ever looked at. I checked it with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I had a long conversation with my colleague (we're still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This movie is as original as the latest movie starring Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The creepy parts have been made thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake, however, is the painfully low pace of this movie. The periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialogue and a lot .. nothing .. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 Molotov cocktails
