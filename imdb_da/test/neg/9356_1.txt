I can't believe in any of the comments made in the reviews. The film is of course dated, and from our pleasant point of view in CGG's age many of the special effects are deeply convincing now. But even for this, Helen of Troy is so bad that it is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Scripture is horrible, just awful, without any characterization at all. The performances suffer as a result you can see as Hardwicke and Andrew's writhing in a pain of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines. The authors seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic manuscript that allows the viewer to determine nothing for themselves. The beginning of the movie comes from the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece; I know they had American audiences to cater for, but the patronizing way we are told twice twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful. I honestly can't believe the above comments that describe this movie as a great epic movie. Even for the relatively primitive movie and the relative sophistication of today's audience, this movie really stinks.
