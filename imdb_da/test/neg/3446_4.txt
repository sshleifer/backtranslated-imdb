I enjoy watching Robert Forster. That was the main reason I rented this movie. I would also see a story take place in the middle of nothing, where the characters could work well out of each other really well without interference. <br /> <br /> Unfortunitaly I found the movie to be boring. I couldn't get interested in the characters. I couldn't get interested in the story, which seemed to be sailing anywhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I switched it off. I will judge the movie 4 out of 10. This falls far short of the mandatory 7 rating that makes a movie worth seeing.
