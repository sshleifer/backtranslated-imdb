Mockumentaries recently spread so much that the approach therefore needs an injection of fresh and creative material every time it is used to maintaining its vitality. This movie delivers nothing but worn-out retreads of similar stories, a speechless script, weak ad libs, uninspired plays and unfunny self-satisfied humor. <br /> <br /> The principle seems promising enough; The legend of the Loch Ness monster is made to order one of these goofy mockumentary misadventures, with a vast array of history and legend waiting to be drained of monstrous satire. However, the film authorities are totally wasting this huge potential. We get a little fooled into a fake Nessie in the water. Give it, it's original. Another scene has an unpleasant idiot that threatens another unpleasant idiot with a gun. Side Splitting. Some gratuitous shots of a beautiful girl in a bikini. Annette did it 40 years ago (and far better, by the way). In the whole movie, somebody always seems to shout: I suppose this is designed to awaken the audience who has nodded at this point. Worst of all, the relentless salvo of these realities is the type of "interview comments" made by the characters. Not only do they throw you with this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently improvised the players too; It's the only explanation for how humorous jokes are. If lines like "I've never seen anyone write a book on non-evidence" were actually written, then the author must be shot on sight and fed to Nessie. No wonder Nessie was fierce; of course this movie.
