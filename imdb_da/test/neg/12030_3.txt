This homemade horror movie tells the story of a guy who kills people who use the motif for stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The local police have bungled the case for a couple of years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one is going to swing at his house, because this is where he hangs out, runs around in his vintage clothes and tortures the random locals. So the FBI chick is kidnapped, which involves her father, the former leading investigator from the local police. To top it all, a pack of wacky college kids has decided to camp in the house and smoke a bunch of grass. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the FBI agent wakes up and screams like a little girl, and not one of the burly college college boys seems to just stop and take a swing at wimpy Poe-boy. Mostly exaggerated and sometimes underacted, Dead End Road reeks of a low-budget, cast-with-friends production that has stupid points for many to cover.
