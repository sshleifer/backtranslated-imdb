It's 2005, my friends ... a time of great special effects and the age of technology. So why can't we see a movie that is a little more thoughtful than this cheesy low budget film. I've seen a lot of low-cost movies knocking out my socks, but one ... it's almost like trying to be horrible. Just ... don't see it. I can see past the lack of special effects and computer-generated scenes if the action itself was at least good. I want a young child to produce this whole movie. There is not even an original plot line. Vampire Assassins, in themselves, are a great plot hole with an attempt to suck themselves. Can anyone tell me if this might have been designed as a comedy movie and I just didn't know? It makes me wonder what has the sequel to storage for us who then loved the first installment?
