Scarlet Dawn casts Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron abandoned by the forces of the Russian Revolution, and now he must defend himself in a world that is not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. He is also not very suitable for any kind of real work. <br /> <br /> Doug could have been caught by the Reds but for the fact that his former servant Nancy Carroll didn't give him away. Nancy has a great old crush at Doug and they get married when they arrived in exile in Istanbul, which throughout the film is featured by its former Christian name Constantinople. They marry and sit down with Doug, now reduced to washing. <br /> <br /> But Fairbank's former lover Lilyan Tashman, who always plays evil girls of a kind movie, jumps at him and offers to get him into some style he's once used to as part of a scam against father and daughter American tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> Good thing this movie has the incredibly short maturity of just 57 minutes, usually they were given to B westerns because it is both boring and melodramatic. The finish is pretty incredible. Doug knew he was in a Thanksgiving special and really overcame the mistakes of an incredible story. <br /> <br /> What I didn't understand was that Fairbanks were trained in the military, why didn't he just become a mercenary after leaving the new Soviet Union? It didn't make sense to me at all. <br /> <br /> I would only see this if I was a dedicated fan of the main players.
