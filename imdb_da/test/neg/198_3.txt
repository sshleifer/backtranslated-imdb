When a friend lambasted me to my first movie (a pretty bad video recorded affair) I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles' first film was actually even worse. He challenged me that it could not be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) NUCLEAR CANE and played HEIGHT OF AGE. My friend lasted just a few minutes before admitting the point. There is little humor in this brief, but it is basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegial answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde movies of the time. That's what it is: a series of images with a vague theme, and unless you really enjoy any footage of Welles (in powerful makeup, to start), it's not really worth tracking.
