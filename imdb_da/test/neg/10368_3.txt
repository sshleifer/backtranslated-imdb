So I decided to see the whole puppet master series, and had just seen parts 1-3 that I thought were ALL good. They had a unique charm for them and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago I even saw the puppet master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a great guilty pleasure and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the start of this movie, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Egyptian skull villain looking at the puppet's Rita Repulsa style through his pyramid glass came straight out of the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly we have a large selection of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are far from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first doll master was written, the authors had visions of seeing an Egyptian Power Rangers villain, totem monsters, annoying thieves somethings who can't seriously act (and must be brilliant scientists, but never say anything intelligent) ), and a lama "Decapitron" puppet whose head can morph into the ghost of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that disappointed me in this movie was that it completely ignores what happened in the last post (Part II, when III was a prequel). Suddenly the puppets are back at the Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and for some reason Toulon is willing to help his dolls again (he betrays them in Part II for his love for Elsa). This is not explained at all. And then with that, and all this other junk threw in, I was no longer amused. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of ridiculous B movies, one knows if you want. I even collect rare discs of rare B movies that you can't find on DVD, and it takes so much for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen in my life. I still love the dolls, the original, the Leaves, the Tunnels, the Pinhead, the Jester and the rest, and if they were only stuck with what they had, rather than trying to fix something that was not destroyed, then the series still look alive and good health. That said, though the reviews are not that big, I'm really interested in checking out the Marionette Master Retro, sounds like an interesting one that pays homage to the original themes.
