The first two hours in the television broadcast are full of character and plot show - after an early short order of Las Vegas hit by tornadoes, the impact doesn't really start until the other two hours. Still, some character issues are not ready for the second part. The actors turn into competent performances, but nothing special (though better than those in "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). One exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The reason is a fairly standard mix of parts of "Independence Day", "Speed", "The Day After Tomorrow", "Earthquake", "The Towering Inferno" and several other films. You can predict what will happen next time and come close to predicting the dialog word by word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects in "Twister", the tornadoes in this movie seem less realistic than that in "The Wizard of Oz", and other effects were obviously made for less money than such series as "CSI" and "Cold Case" expenses on the totality. of a single episode. To watch a disaster movie made for TV, see "Day after", "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin" instead - you get better plot, action and effects.
