I had another experience with this movie - it never became charming, or nice or fun to me. A great idea that this was not your typical movie was that the label did not give any indication of the language spoken in the movie. another was the lack of choice subtitles. <br /> <br /> I found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it was almost always. The wildly inconsistent development of the weak plot was marvelous. Were there signs or only vague movements? Was there even a plot? On a separate question, I am asked to correct the spelling of "dialogue" with the proposed replacement for "dialogue". Perhaps this movie in its entirety, including the IMDb section, is designed to puzzle or amaze, but I get more annoyed than amused.
