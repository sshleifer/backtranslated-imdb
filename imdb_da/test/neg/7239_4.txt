During the summer, the queue for this attraction is really long, as it is water tours. It is a very good theme, but many of the artifacts of the tours seem to be out of order. Overall, the trip is not worth it if you have to wait almost 2 hours. in the line. The drop at the end is exciting, but the whole trip itself could have been better. Creators for Indiana Jones could have prob. helped these Hollywood designers. Also many times the trip goes down and causes even longer waiting times for others. It is also very uncomfortable when they only have a naval exit port open and not the two as they should. During Halloween Horror Nights, you drive in the dark and it is exciting if it is your first time, but if not, do not wait for a four-hour line.
