I was looking forward to seeing this movie and it contains very interesting perspectives from Iraqis across the country, not just in large areas. But as the film continued, and as it seemed to be becoming more and more unilateral, I began to wonder who had edited the film. Of course, to get hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes, decisions had to be made. I would really have had a movie showing how everyday Iraqis felt on all sides of the problems, but with newspaper headlines as opposed to what people said, and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end, I thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a predetermined bias. <br /> <br /> It could have been such a big movie.
