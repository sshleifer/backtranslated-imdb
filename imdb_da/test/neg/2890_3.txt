I've been on a bad run with movies. This is a clinker about a fire plot and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, who I really enjoy, was pretty young here. He is a builder with passion, but he has a partner whose merits include overinsurance and burning. Into the mix comes an agent who is drowned, his daughter and her keychain's girlfriend. James Mason plays insurance researcher. Any idiot, given a small warning, would know that something had rotted in Australia. Yet they are blurring their way. The most interesting thing for me was that the big hotel that was to be built never came to be a bunch of sticks. Low budget, I guess. The reason could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a movie editor (did it?). Half of the time you don't know where the signs are, but I guarantee a $ 5 million payout would probably have made it careful to see the structure mandatory. It does not work. Although there is plenty of nice fire.
