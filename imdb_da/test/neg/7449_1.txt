The first Robocop had a sense of cynical gentle and a sick sense of violence. It was a nice line to go, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and the film did well, they made a sequel. How terrible. (Possible Spoilers at the front - though everything that can ruin this is beyond me). Irvin Kershner is not the director of this type of film. He obviously did not understand the origin of the originals, and as a result, the massive over-the-top meaningless violence looks very bad - and worse is very unpleasant. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era, and the heroic, light music doesn't match the pictures on the screen at all! What did he score? The great American hero?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated Robocop's theme from the first movie, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without John Williams fanfare or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? !! Plot is just a collection of ideas that do not gel. In the beginning we see Robo "stalking" his old wife. Good idea. But they release it completely after that. Then there is a stupid idea that the company reprograms Robo to be good. It is thrown for 10 minutes and then immediately dropped. Or the stupid idea that the repulsive 10-year-old fabric lover reminds his son's Robo - once again a faint motif that appears briefly twice and dropped. This may work in a cartoon, but not on film, and Frank Miller was unfortunately inexperienced at the time and threw any idea with the kitchen sink. It doesn't seem like a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to be praising the company's bashing in this movie and the privatization of the police. It is the best part of the movie that is consistent with the first. But in the original, the old man was a hard-working businessman for a profit, but ultimately fair in the end. In this movie, he is just plain evil in his desire for money and power. You can't just change characters that way for no reason. And Nancy Allen's character is useless in this movie, while at first she was crucial to Robo's search for herself. She is as free as the violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And the violence, yes the violence. I enjoy many violent, bloody movies when they serve purpose and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to mean that people are blown to pieces, shot in pieces, children are lurking for death and torture and people's desire for drugs. He does not know when to stop. Should we really see every innocent onlooker (even people trying to help others) get shot up ???? It is derived when we see the bad Robocop shoot repeatedly! Instead, Mr Kershner proves that he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an eerie mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse, a vile message of violence for any young person who sees this movie. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not intended to be message-y, and I certainly don't see Robocop movie or Alien or Predator movie for that reason. But when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do must be questioned. And as for this movie, in the words of the evil kid drug dealer, the last words he dies are "It still sucks".
