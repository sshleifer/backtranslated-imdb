I really wanted to like this movie because I love Troma and loved the trailer and loved "Ghouls", another of Ferrin's movies. It had some almost good moments that oldies love the song playing over the car crash scene and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure. But on the whole it was just boring and mildly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The "unthinkable" shocks Ferrin came up with were truly predictable and worn. Poop, murder of prostitutes, incest. Could still have been good but poorly done. Not sure if it was trying to offend, entertain or both. In the end, it didn't. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we see Troma movies because we want movies with hearts. This movie did not consistently feel that it had a heart. There were some good scenes, but in the end it was boring and uncomfortable.
