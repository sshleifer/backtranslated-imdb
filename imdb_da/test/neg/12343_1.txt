11 years after this movie was released, only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this complete lack of interest in the entire moon. It is coherent, but lacks all film skills. Watch this movie for examples of horrible production in all respects. The opening credits are, for example, white letters that rise mechanically from a red background. The closing functions Michael McKean stares into a prison window that says "There are many mysteries out there." followed by a clip montage / music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragic bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is terrible. I struggled to find any value in this movie and got empty. Although it's hard to believe, a future role from Burgess Meridith (always a crowd pleaser) has only disappointed me further. This movie is like a mockery of what's special about movies. On paper, the film is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost unattainable. The film tries to branch off in many directions, but never follows through anyone. The unpleasant conflict with having their boyfriends in prison has never been resolved. No conflict has ever been resolved. There really is no conflict. The women are trying to become hookers, but it never happens. Instead, they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf container. Sound exciting? It wasn't that. It was stupid. And most of the film is the two women who speak and generate a constructed conflict. The women are capable of actresses, but the manuscript was beyond poor. Useless. This was a horrible movie, but it is even worse that they borough Burgess Meridith out of his retirement home to do so. Poor from start to finish. Like the lion without teeth, this film has no bite.
