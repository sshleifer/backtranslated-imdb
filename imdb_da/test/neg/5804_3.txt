There is an underlying stream in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, don't take it seriously. Chillax dude !!! Well that's a point of view. The other would be - why do we exactly accept the same script, the same formula and the same scary people in all those "comedies". What you get is a slacker who, through some totally unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always one male), overcome a set of circumstances that would only pose a problem for a raccoon or a teenager, beat it just stupid stupid guy trying to steal gal he met two days earlier and wins by remaining a slacker but with more money / self-esteem. On the way, someone does something rough but very illogical. This means that the viewer can call a person after the movie and say something like "you don't want to believe it. This guy finds the ewe drowned in the foam diarrhea the other guy left after he ate lax brownies. Then he shines his shoes with it" . Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Most of the usual names appear. David Spade and Rob Schneider do unfunny shtick, but they are crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and I keep my pages, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, the king of the brain-free unfunny, illogical comedy co-producer and some unscrupulous no-one called Dante turn out again. The United States has to explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for because we are clueless. Allen Covert plays a 36-year-old who got the biggest laugh of the night from me. He was 42 and then years older. <br /> <br /> Did I read? Yes, but no more than I wanted on a TV sit-com and I don't have to pay a penny to see them. Please stop making these movies.
