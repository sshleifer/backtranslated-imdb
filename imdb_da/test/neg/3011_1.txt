VIP keys are just another of the awful T.V. that shows you can and will look at this station. The show is terrible where men claim to be real players competing against each other (there are two of them competing in each episode) in stupid games trying to get girls into a bar to talk to them, get girls numbers etc. The judges are four other guys who also claim to be expert recorders, but they also look like just big d-bags like the participants. The show is not fun at all and not even interesting, it's just boring to see these guys desperately trying to convince us what amazing players they are (talking more about the four judges than I am about the participants). Nothing fun has even happened in the shows I've seen, and the shows are of course rigged. Do you really think they've invited all these people to the club, get them to sign releases and get them on tape, while those guys are doing the same stupid games with them? It's not at all real, it's just stupid, it's enough enough to tie up during the day. Someone else here wrote how they knew someone on the show and it was all fake yes yes it's obvious it's a fake show, and even with actors it's still not fun. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
