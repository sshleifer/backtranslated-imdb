(Spoiler's Ahead!) The same exact plot from this movie has been done before. It has been done in Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays ill. His faithful parents believe in him. His sister knows he is falling, but she still has to go to school! She is angry. He has a party with his friends while his parents are gone. When his parents come home, he is sick again, and his parents have never found out the party. I like Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
