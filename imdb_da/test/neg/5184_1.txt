In fact, I can't think of a good point in this movie. The story is horrible. The action is so blunt as a carrot, and the manuscript is so bad, it will kill you. Ok fine, if you love (and you must love it to understand) snowboarding, you like it microscopically better, as it has great mountains and some beautiful movements, but apart from that it's terrible. It has some very stupid ideas, and it is racist with both black and white people who offend each other's races. The only time you want to laugh is when you laugh at the stupidity or you feel embarrassed by the movie. I've seen many movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie, I suggest you take it back to where you bought it and get your money back.
