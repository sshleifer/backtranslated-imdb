There were only two redeeming features about this film; The Bucharest's beauty and its architecture, and the way they portrayed the transformation from human form to wolf form. Forget about the plot or story from the book - they are completely absent from this movie. In fact, the only things transferred from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you will hardly recognize the characterizations. If the filmmakers had made a good movie, I would not have been so disappointed, even if they were not related to the book. Unfortunately, they didn't. The reason and history are typical of low budget horror flicks, the play is wood, and the direct action everyday. Oh yes, the way the loup garou bends to their leader is pure hook. I suppose a key to recognition is due to the animal handle. The wolves were beautiful animals and well-managed in their roles.
