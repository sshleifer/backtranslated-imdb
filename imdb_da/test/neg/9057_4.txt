I didn't hate this one. I just couldn't adjust my story. It didn't really catch me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I disagree with his methods in this. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. Some projects he has been in are pretty bad, but his plays are brilliant. My favorite Daniel Day Lewis movies are going to be blood and gait in New York. There is one thing I loved about this and it was musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about everything i liked in it myself. This movie also has a high voice, which is a bit random. I can see that quite a few people will like this, but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a lady if I were you, but there are many high voices for this so I guess you should see it and make your own views on what you think. I really didn't like it ............. 4/10 ............. j.d Seaton
