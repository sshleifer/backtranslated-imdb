This short was Director Del Lord's last and only Shemp card. The problem: It was rather weak and the cafe scene was largely a carbon copy of a Curly Short "Busy Buddies" (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty fun, and the first part of the cafe section. But there are many plotholes in this brief. Why are stooges stored in the trash, for example, when the police arrive? In the remake "Cash and Hash" (1955) director Jules White sets this up and the reason for stooges hiding in the trash is because there is a warfare between the police and the armored drivers. The scene where Moe has problems with the oyster was previously done with the curl in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The creepy house was not so big except for the hilarious scene outside the creepy house. To top it off, the end had nothing to do with it. Rating: C-
