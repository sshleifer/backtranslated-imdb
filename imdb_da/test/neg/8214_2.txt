My bad movie guru (and president of the Exposed Film Society) jumped this on us last week. There was no denying the dull flash in his eye as he pulled it out of his brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "The Dangerous Game", which was budgeted for about $ 2.95. <br /> <br /> Of course, $ 2.95 went much further back in 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> Still, there's a lot to do about this movie. It is bound by serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the "repetitive musket" that fired twice in two minutes without the benefit of a reload). The hero is a wuss who stands by, while his wounded friend is fighting the bench and is being killed. <br /> <br /> More? The Ok plot is a shambles without continuity talking about. The movie wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' that serves as the physical design of the villains' madness and paranoia, but never shows him again. The hero is choked by unconscious hands, but does not mention it when he wakes up and first meets his host. The dumb waitress is trapped, put on the stand ... and then the movie (and the hero who puts her in this problem) is just "forgetting" about her. <br /> <br /> More? Now the sets are cheap and the special effects are cheaper (makeup is an exception to this). Much of the plot is borne by the narrator's drone, monotonic voice-over, which carries less dramatic influence than the Denny's ward transition. Most of the dialogue is simply ridiculous and stalked as if it were translated from Japanese. ("I require our conversation to be enjoyable !!!") And the color values ​​tended to change sharply from shots to shots, as if cheap film storage and problem lighting equipment were the order of the day. (Note - this last may have caused a bad print, rather than the camera's crew). <br /> <br /> But there were a few good moments here and there. The makeup effects were incredibly good, unlike the rest of the movie, the actors were looking interesting, especially the stupid maid and countess. And in spite of everything, there was a certain eerie atmosphere that was found, very unpleasant and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So what was the deal with this movie? I was thinking a little about it and realized that director / writer Pat Boyette was basically trying to make a story out of the old "movie EF" movies. It would take into account the stylish dialogue, the outlined character development (in a cartoon, physiognomy = characters even more than in movies), the story's loopy-logic ("EC") horror stories went out of their way to include an unpleasant "shock" ending and was not much of a psychological realism), the overbearing reliance on the narrative voice (belonging to texts across the panels) and the interesting makeup effects that mimic the pigs' images that the old EC artists did so well. <In fact, I would be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his leading man during casting, he immediately saw that the guy was as close to being the same as the lies, shambling characters and caved in faces of artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis acted as a real human being could exist and still exist in the real world. He used costumes and lighting to emphasize comic-like aspects of visuals and transformed everyone into living EC cartoon characters. (See: the shining beauty of the leading lady, the county's strong bony traits, strange bronze skin and sharp notch, the platinum makes on the tall, bony, black hands, etc.) <br /> <br /> This would explain the film's shortcomings. Boyette knew how to "hit" things, but he didn't know how to handle three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a creepy story within the framework of a comic book page, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. He wouldn't be the first person with this problem of course - see what Joel Schumacher did for "Batman". But he didn't have a big budget to hide behind. <br /> <br /> In any case, I imagine that Boyette got away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about the "Dungeon of Harrow" than the people posting on this movie's bulletin board. He did, within certain vague limits, what he set up to do, and you must respect him for it ... even if you don't care about "Harrow".
