I totally disagree with the previous reviewer: This movie has entertaining moments, but hardly a ridiculous uprising. (Unless you really think you're slipping from a septic tank, and heads exploding in a vice is a laughing mound) In fact, the only reasons I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 because one) two of the actors are decent b.) the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in contrast and c.) monster truck is pretty scary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with some intermittent, spooky or interesting ideas overwhelmed by relentless cruelty, crudity and vileness. The former best friendship character is one of the most annoying I have ever seen, and the little grace that hitchhiker character had disappeared in yet another constructed twist ending that makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> A waste of the main actor showing some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress depicting the hitchhiking character ...
