Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a sympathetic ex-judge, just released from prison, helping the feds neighbor to a corrupt small town Sheriff. Recalled Reynolds was often accused of critics just calling the beliefs of these 'good ol' in; True, he is on auto-pilot all the way through. But in his day, Reynolds knew how to make a low effort, work well for himself. Ingrediating and beautiful, Reynolds comes so close to glancing at the audience that he can without breaking up; He seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star, while director Joesph Sargent gives a light pace and a sweaty mood that brings the South to life. Unfortunately, the story is not much, and supportive actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins are superior (as usual). Diane Ladd is fine in a small part, and the real daughter Laura Dern can glimpse in the background. Reynolds returned to this character until 1976's "Gator". * 1/2 from ****
