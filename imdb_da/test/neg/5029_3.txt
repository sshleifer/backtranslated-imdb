The film is nothing but an exhibition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It seems that the only winning action for Portuguese filmmakers must include some (if not much) sober key of the local stars along with slang, which is otherwise horrified in Portuguese society today. If you see the promotion of Portuguese movies on Portuguese television, they have all included a "hot" scene from the movie. I do not say in any way that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the film industry doesn't seem to find other ways to succeed. Going back to the movie ... There is nothing left of the book's spirit, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been a good one if emphasis had been placed on the real idea of ​​the book (of topicality at all times) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was horrible ...
