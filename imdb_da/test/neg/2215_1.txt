There is something about Doug McLure's appearance in a movie that guarantees misery. His initials are like a special cinema certification that comes somewhere before 'U'. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Cushing seemed to suffer from both a dilator and a poor judgment. He did excellent work in Hammer movies like Dr. Van Helsing. I've seen him make a very acceptable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably the Grand Moff Tarkin in the first 'Star Wars'. The only man, but the emperor, who could tell Darth Vadar to "stop bickering" and get away with it. Men - crikey! - He made some turkeys. There was the regrettable 'Daleks' movie for one. And here's another one. <br /> <br /> There is a machine that has been hijacked from Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a front screw and traction units on the sides. I'm surprised Jerry Anderson's defendant for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought. But if the movie is a guide, they may not have paid him much. <br /> <br /> It's 1976, and we're still playing in latex romper suits. <br /> <br /> It's about it really. Some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad good' category. You can't even do that. It would not even entertain children. 'Crash Corrigans' things from the 1930s have got more on the way to it.
