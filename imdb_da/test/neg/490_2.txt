First of all, the genre in this movie is not comedy, it's more of a drama. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for the movie and still they didn't get up. As some of the other reviews point out, there are some good music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music, I suggest spending the time watching a concert recording with Bon Jovi or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be more quality time. Last, if you want to see a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "almost famous".
