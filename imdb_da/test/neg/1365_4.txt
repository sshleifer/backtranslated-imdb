I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies, and I actually like to like them less and less every time I see a new one, and that's not surprising when I end up watching movies like Satan's Brotherhood! Despite its low rating on IMDb, I was surprised to hear some good things about this movie and my expectations went up. This turned out to be a big mistake as this is precisely the movie that its assessment suggests it is: a very bad one! The foundation is your basic group of Satanists who cause problems, and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped, and that is not exactly why. Of course, Satanists are behind it, and it is bad news for a mother, father and daughter on a road trip caught in the mysterious city. I had the feeling that this movie could be the same as the crazy satanic flick 'The Devil's Rain', and even though it's not as silly as Robert Fuest's later movie, it's not much better either. The reason seems to be right down to Earth, but it's also pretty boring, and I can't say I've had it all in this movie. Satan's brotherhood, of course, has its fans, but I am not one of them; this is a movie i see no reason to recommend ...
