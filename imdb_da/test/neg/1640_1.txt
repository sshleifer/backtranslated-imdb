BOOOOOOOORRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. Stayed asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe running around in a furry Speedo by no means rent this movie. If not, don't bother ... Rife with anachronism. Should this be stated in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age or the Age? What caused the black nylon wig on the guy dressed up as Genghis Khan? Should it really be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so much advanced technology and science, why had we wait another 1000 years for Leonardo? It is never clear where Ator comes from or if he was to be a superior kind of being. You wonder if it was all explained in the first movie, but after seeing this you know you will never bother.
