many people said this was a good movie with hoffman delivering a good performance. I went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost going out. there is no one there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman goes all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes he plays an affected man just as the concerned actor chews on stage. No sign in the movie than capote is much more than placeholders - Nell, Jack, Perry, Shawn, the Sheriff are all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> yes the film shows manipulative, preaching, dishonest sides of capote. It shows them so many times, I began to wonder why - do the filmmakers think we should have everything spelled out? and again? and again? it often refers to the capote's genius, but does not show it. It shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers, but never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> But my goal is not to deconstruct the movie. I'm sure others will have other interpretations. for me it was a two-hour movie that felt like five.
