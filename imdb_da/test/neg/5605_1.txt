I saw this out of curiosity. I enjoyed the Stargate SG1, and I've seen many of the other TV shows and movies that the protagonists have been working on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised to be so terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The whole story is appalling and the script is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero study of the bad science sprayed throughout the movie or in martial arts (as several cast members engage throughout the film, despite clearly not having any martial arts training (baton twirling not a war do)) training makes the already unhappy plot even less credible. The same weapon (worn by Michael Shanks) when they shot at the side of a mountain, causes extreme damage, but when you shoot indoors at the wall made of wicker, you create a small fireworks effect without damaging the curve structure - OK, I assuming Michael Shanks fans will be sued to see that in the Stargate SG1, where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on the protagonist or explodes a hole in part of the castle wall as needed), but still ... A bad CGI snake ' God eats one of the believers as a dog would eat - snakes just don't behave like that. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a remote planet is at best stupid. Matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are obliged to propagate the species - for example, Picts, who did not find out men's role in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - at which time the balance of power moved from the women to the men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate knowledge of science - especially of medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this scientific level is based solely on the original author's wet dream. Of course, the few references to stellar science made in this movie show that the author did not know anything about it either (except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other films). Still, it could have been better - like "She" in 1965, who for example showed the matriarchal society with some reverence, far more credible, and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fat exercise in stupidity. Marching a couple of women around in 'armor', pouting aggressively, and spitting their lines as a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub ("Come on, I'll do you!") Seems to be over-simplifying the complexity of a matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> The cultural references are so simple - 'all the hail snake mother' sums it all up. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variation. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wise, thoughtful, interesting, visually exciting or externally entertaining about this movie. The soundtrack is of the same quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the few, overly charitable positive reviews this movie has received, are from flashing Michael Shanks fans who will give thumbs up to something he is involved in. Don't fool. Low budgets aren't a reason why a movie fails - cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them, and there is no need to inflict this film on yourself.
