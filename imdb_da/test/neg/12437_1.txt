I recently had to watch this on a project in a sociology class and thought it was definitely the worst movie I've ever had to sit through. It was like a bad cinemax movie with all the "good bits" taken out. The bad play, the fake documentary, the uneven plot and the ruthless direction combine all to create a horrible, horrible movie. The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: "He's hot." "He has a boyfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "None." * girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes. boy coming out and sitting next to another boy, girl saunters off * "have you hit it?" "No, I didn't want to remove my pants." "You are stupid." Another girl turns up when the boys go to Beverly Hills, get in line with one of the boys, and when they are pulled over by a policeman, you see the car bobbing up and down. <br /> <br /> A gay pervert, a trigger-happy Clint Eastwood is similar, and what seems to be a luchador mask all adds to the inanity. One of the boys gets caught by a policeman, no one cares. One of the boys is shot, no one cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised and it shows. Just awful. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
