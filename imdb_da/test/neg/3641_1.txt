Right, where do I start? I can't even imagine understanding this preteen pathetic excuse for a show. Picture this: a boarding school where children whose parents roll in money just throw them in there to radiate around the world themselves. It couldn't be more diabolical than this. <br /> <br /> If you taught these children, they should not even upgrade them to the term teenagers, because they hardly seem like sane homosapiens, were self-centered, think again. About 23 minutes filled up with their so-called problems, boy problems and the like. <br /> <br /> Heroine of the show, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Britney's Polly Pocket Little Miss, I'm All The sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, of course has a lot to learn about acting. But I will give her some face because her superficial, one-dimensional character does not allow much space for depth. She plays the Pacific Coast Academy's sun, moon and stars, crusaders fighting for all the women's situation, gender equality. Perfect in everybody, always with his two loyal side sticks, Nicole, daffy bimbo, who of course has too much of dad's cash, and hard chick, Dana, proving a hard nut to crack. Both left the exhibition in the years 2 and 1, not that I blame it. But horror of horror, in Lola, sees herself the greatest actress since Natalie Wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. She is even more rude than Zoey herself, if even possible, and even more stupid than Nicole, and hell, we know it can't be done. <br /> <br /> This show, which all the excused excuses for television programs Nickelodeon has spun since the 2000s, is a primary victim of stereotypes. Get the girl nearby and close to her best friend's feelings for her Zoey, a great, albeit untreated, sometimes best kid's gossip, Chase, a cool, arrogant female man, Logan, a boy and a crazy crazy girl who is not very bright Nicole the one everyone thinks is weird, just because she is extremely smart, nerd, Quinn, the over-dramatic, annoying yet super-thin, Malibu picture perfect model, Lola, and the hard but soft interior woman, Dana. Where have I heard these signs before? I'm sorry, but what's so wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about Science, and actually cares about her future and thrives in the academic aspect, where the rest must also be concerned, is she "weird" and a "geek"? Lola at the beginning of the series turned out to be a potentially big sign with his sassy ways and different outlook in life. Zoey just had to go out and get out of your forks, burn her on the stake, go back to Weird Town and all the jazz. So much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola was nothing more of another OC clone, in all its anorexic glory. Probably not to exceed his mistress. But hey, the 2000 generation MySpace whore seems to love it with Chase / Zoey's typical adventurous romance, the thrill of adamant, "hot" Logan and "kick-ass" Zoey or Dana, depending on your taste and the beautiful people. Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, shallow and stupid lifestyle. Sorry to break it to you darlings, it doesn't happen unless you have a great trust fund and parents to subdue you.
