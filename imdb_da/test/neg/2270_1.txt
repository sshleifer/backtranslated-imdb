The comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version is long short. <br /> <br /> The casting is uninspired and the working wood. You get the impression that the director has not read the book, so the characters did not understand. Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous, but his accidental silliness captured by Redgrave brilliantly (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> Musgrove sisters are so unlikely to understand why Wentworth or anyone else would give them another look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is without feeling. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion, the two felt to each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this it is difficult to understand that Anne has spent years in regret unless you have read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the protagonists' relationship. <br /> <In the scene where Wentworth enters Anne and Mary with breakfast, it looks to the viewer that Mary thinks they are little acquaintances. In the 1995 version, when Wentworth enters (the first time he sees her this year), the tension is thick. The reunion comes from Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth Hips Lousia, it's as if he's really invested, lacking the undercurrents. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger at Anne. He flaunting his proposal before Anne, as saying "see what you gave up, I don't need or want you anymore". <br /> <br /> But he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take Anne back home illustrates. In the 1995 version, the viewer Anne's shock sees that he would break if she was tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that he still cares. In this version, he just goes with Lousia as if nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> The pivotal scene where Anne talks to Harville about who loves the longest, male or female, is completely hit. The actors recite only lines without emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When Anne reads the letter from Wentworth, it's like reading a grocery list. <br /> <br /> Contrast this to the 1995 version, where the viewer feels Annes joy at her second chance. We are there with her when she reads the letter. The director had both actors reading the letter and you both hear their voices. Wentworth is filled with frustration, passion and hope, while Anne's first is incredible, evolving into joy. <br /> <br /> This production has several scenes after the revelation, probably because it was necessary to explain the viewer what just happened. The 1995 edition did not need to explain we knew and rejoiced over the signs. The only thing that this production has in its favor is that it kept Mrs Smith's subplot intact while the 1995 version did not. <br /> <br /> The 1995 version included part of Austen's original ending. The place where Wentworth is commissioned by the Admiral to find out about Anne and Mr. Elliot will move back to her house (as he and Mrs Croft rent) after they have married. <br /> <br /> This is a production that must be avoided at all costs.
