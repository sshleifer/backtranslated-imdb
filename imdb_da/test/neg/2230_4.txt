My Take: Typically routine and lazy just for Disney video trials. <br /> <br /> Disney must fall in love with the family movie family tradition. Many films have dedicated themselves to stories that focus exclusively on man's best friend. Disney has even made a handful. They also made a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add this to that bunch. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the original for a long time, so I'm not the right person to judge whether this straight-to-video sequel is getting better. Anyone over the age of seven is not the right people to see it either. Perhaps only the youngest of the young will see LADY AND TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say that it was not the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen. I think to be fair I can say is that it guarantees a rental, but that's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This successor virtually left behind the original often called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and a creeping mongrel called Scamp, a chip from the old block. Instead of limiting the home, Scamp wants to run away with the city's other junkyard dogs, unknown to his father's own past as one of those street mongrels. To capture the charm of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog / rich dog love story, in reverse. Scamp falls for one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Aside from the "sweet" factor, there is nothing for every audience in this lazy, straight-to-video action. Stick with the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
