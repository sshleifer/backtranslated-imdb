Coen Brothers wannabe from author director Paul Chart relies too much on ideas raised from other (better) movies, but still can't manage to create a grim atmosphere that keeps one to see. Robert Forster cuts loose like never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (haha) who goes on a killing in the heads. The movie is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for Amanda Plummer who is actually humiliating). Admittedly, a bravura finale, many quirky shops - and Forster looks good in the neck - makes this a curiosity object, no more. Veteran movie director Irvin Kershner produced and perhaps should also be addressed (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 from ****
