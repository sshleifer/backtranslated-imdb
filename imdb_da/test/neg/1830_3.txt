Finally came to watch this movie last weekend. What a disappointment .. it almost reaches "made to TV" level. In light of the actor list, I would have expected something significantly more sophisticated. The film lacks a good story, indeed, a story for that matter. It has no credibility but much predictability. Save yourself money and time.
