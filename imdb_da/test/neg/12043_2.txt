This movie really shows its age. The print I saw was awful because of age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. However, this was not the big problem with the movie. The problem was that even though the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent movie with only the least of the dialogue scattered (few sentences) in the movie at most amateur fashion. Sometimes the signs of the character were reversed, or they spoke with their hands over their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to hide their lips and "cleaverly" (?) Hide the fact that the movie was dubbed. Well, it is true that this Czech movie would be dubbed in many languages, but doing so in this way was really stupid and obvious. It just looked good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looked low budget and silly. However, it is a shame because there was a grain of a good story - a young woman who marries an elderly man who is either gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. Even with a few glimpses of the naked (and slightly lumpy) Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth all the trouble that came with the movie when it debuted. Even at 1933 standards, this film was a badly made dud. About the only thing interesting about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared to the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to America - she looks like 2 completely different people. It's such an incomplete look and technically inferior movie, I can't see how it's got such rave reviews. Only for technical problems, the film cannot judge a 10 or anything near it.
