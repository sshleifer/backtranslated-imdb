Ohhhh MAN this movie is horrible !! <br /> <br /> This kind of tripe is what gives the Canadian cinema a bad name or no name. Well, to be fair, I think most Canadian movies give a bad name to Canadian cinema. <br /> <br /> Alongside the characters (there are a few that are the most lattice in film history), the most annoying editing and pace of the movie is. It's like a drunk snail that makes its way to die. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She is the only thing that kept me going. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was interrupted. <br /> <br /> Good for a laugh, even if you have a bad Canadian movie night, though. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie Doane? The only good point (too badly they didn't mind holding the camera on her for more than one blink at a time). Another addition to the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
