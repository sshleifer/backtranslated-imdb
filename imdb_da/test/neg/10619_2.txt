Now it's a bad movie if I've ever seen one. In one of the movie's greatest years, 1999, Detroit Rock City regrets the Runaway Bride and the Wild Wild West at the bottom of a barrel of junkies. The foundation is masterful. Four scrawny high school students finally have a chance to see KISS's hard-hit threats for the third consecutive year. So when their tickets are shaken by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mother, they expect to come to Detroit and I'm sure you can find out the rest. ; The film goes to extreme measures explaining how the four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go on getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confession; rescues a smoked bimbo and your mother's Volvo (from Sopran's Steve Schirripa anyway); preventing a robbery in the midst of crushing one for a 12-year debt; And of course, stripping down to your bare necessity for MC Ron Jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon residue. It sounds funny or not? Perhaps Detroit Rock City has a point with all this tomfoolery in how extremely sometimes these fans can go. And we understand that this movie is a comedy; it must be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City aim for the right audience? It is classified R, which means the only way that prepubescent young people - as I see it, as many will eventually salute this a classic will voyeur is through illegal conditions. Detroit Rock City is also failing in the late 1970s. The camera's texture quality is far too clear and far too light, lacking the required flair from movies as this is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would have made it possible for the audience to feel "at home" with time. Simply costing children in pre-90s grunge wear and settling others in the `disco infernos' does not do the trick. Environment means something you know; I doubt that Detroit looked this glamorous in '78. If there is anything positive coming from this movie, it is the kick-ass soundtrack of the hard late 70s to the early 80s. Van Halen, AC / DC, you are called, it's all here. Of course, we can't forget KISS, where the band is subject to it all. <br /> <br /> What the film noticeably fails to answer is the question of why the knights of the Satin's Service (it is really just KISS) were so frayed by the VAT around the nation. Sure, the high rock and devilish makeup can be part of it; Encouraging the youth to explore themselves and feel good can also be reasonable reasons. But what does KISS say in the music, we hear the whole movie against this very rebellious group? What sets these anthems apart from "rock [ing] and roll [ing] all night and partying every day" from the rest of the music? Most likely, these issues will remain in a music communication class and not in the movies that will answer them simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God-forgiving power to see them. <br /> <br />1.5/5 stars
