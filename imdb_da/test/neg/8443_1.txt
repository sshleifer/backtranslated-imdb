I was severely ripped off with this purchase. The other posters pretty much cover the flaws in this poor poor movie. My DVD, I bought, actually had 1978 Piranha poster art on the front with the credits for that movie on the cover 'Directed by Joe Dante', etc. I was really disappointed to find the wrong movie on the disc. I'm actually a fan of lots of bad movies. There is always something fun or at least fun at most of them somewhere. Something this movie! In fact, I will spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar DVD just for the principle of the case. Blatant false packaging here. Watch the worst movie all the time. No redeeming factors at all. BORING !!! Not even worth checking out just to see how bad it is. Seriously.
