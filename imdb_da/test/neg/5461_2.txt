This is similar to one of these Australian films by "talented" students and funded by the government. It's chock full of smart pictures of colors and shapes and verbal excursions in Freudian psychology, which is appreciated by both art students and teachers, but generally it is a stupid passion of good cinema, good storytelling and generally good taste. This is what I think when art students become so obsessively overbearing. "Pink Flamingoes" are miles ahead of one of the same topics. Some 70's porn movies are much more visible and inspiring. The book of revelation is not entirely without profit, but as an overall experience it is far below the average B-class.
