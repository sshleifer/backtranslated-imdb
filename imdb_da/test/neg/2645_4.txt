This was one of the most mixed movies I've ever seen. Everything in the movie seemed to be related to justifying any other item that had been glued on. There is even a talking buffalo who wants his wet nose to be rubbed to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck in just to give the kids an excuse to fly away in a wagon. It was ridiculous, but unpleasantly because of the serious issues that seemed to be used just to create the plot.
