This begins interestingly as there is a carnival right next to a person's house with an oil rig right there and a kind of shop church across the street with a neon "Jesus hiding" sign, okay in a small area .... Now it's pretty dazzling, if unlikely ... and then we go straight into the movie, which is unlikely to be new. Of course, this is a lame remake of the 1979 thriller with Carol Kane as the babysitter Jill Johnson .... now Jill is some chickens who drove up her cell phone minutes so her evil parents punish her by getting her to work it out probably something that the audience can identify this movie target with. Jill is taken to this large and fancy house on a lake in the midst of heaven (of course) by her father to babysit to the Mandrakis family. The kids are already put all silent in their beds when Jill arrives and the housekeeper is still there, huh, she couldn't babysit? Of course, in spite of the remote location, one of Jill's friends comes forward, one that she apparently has problems with as "girlfriend steals" or something. Nevertheless, the alarm in the house obviously goes without reason and then calls from someone begin to enter, calls from someone who wants to kill her. Of course, Jill calls the police, and since there has been no actual threat in her life, she shuts her off but tells her to call back if there is anything else they can do for her. Check out the scene with Jill calling her friends at the high school bonfire / pep rally or whatever it should be, it looks like a kind of "Burning Man" festival, ?? !! ?? ?? There are all sorts of fragile scares in this, including the cool cat Chester who of course pops up here and there, one of the tiredest horror movie clich√©s is there. I want to admit that I went out some time during this and I missed something? Hard to tell or care, really. This is one of the movies that makes me wonder how badly Remake of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been. Still, it seems that the people who were most afraid of this were 12-year-old girls, from reading online reviews, and I can only assume it from statements such as "it made me throw my pants". Now one can only hope that this will put an end to Hollywood remakes of movies that were not quite the stars at first, but did not bet on it. 2 out of 10 and I'm overly generous.
