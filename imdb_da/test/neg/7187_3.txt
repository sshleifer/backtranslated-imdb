There is not much to say at the end. One would have expected much more from a director who had made better movies in the past. It just seems like he did it without being caring. The actors do their job (though Belmondo is far from amazing), but you just don't get confused. In one word it is boring. This is even more disappointing when I heard several times that this movie could be seen as a reaction to all the major American blockbusters who are considered a threat to the French exception of those who just cannot admit to turning for another job. I tell you, if it's the best reaction we need to get, boy, I'll soon be depressed ...
