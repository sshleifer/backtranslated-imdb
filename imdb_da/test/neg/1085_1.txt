This movie was pure boredom from the beginning to the end. Okay, so I welcome Boorman to increase the worldwide recognition of events in Burma, but that's all he achieves. About 10 minutes in the movie I thought, "Oh no, here we go again" and I could have told you exactly what would happen in the next 80 minutes or so. Patricia Arquette was out of her depth in such a role, and her plays were wood and convincing. Remind yourself to be sitting with such a horrible conventional script, maybe boredom put in, and was so reflected on the screen. Much of the movie was simply ridiculous. At one point, Arquette's older company shot and he is down on the ground. In the next scene he jumps through the forest and of course tries to break the world's 100 meter record! - Or maybe he's just trying to run away from Boorman !!. If you have trouble sleeping one night then play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and you will snore in no time. I rarely criticize a movie as heavily as this, but in this case it is quite justified.
