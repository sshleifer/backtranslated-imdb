German emigree and uber-hambone actor Paul Muni, who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up, goes "blackface" to play a humble Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and working his way up the world. If this creaking vehicle is reminiscent of some of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultivated Cuban in remake of SCARFACE, don't be surprised. The characters are quite similar, and both become wildly pop-eyed when the script requires it. Hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by Muni's over-the-top performance as this giddy Mexican lives the American dream, consequences being condemned. I think Benicio DelToro's grandfather was not available. A young, bleached blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests; she eventually goes crazy for love for Mr. Meh-Hee-Can Muni. An absolute hoot, Davis is the only reason to see this racially offensive claptrap. There is an absolutely scary closeness when Muni asks crazy of his dreams to marry him - a white gal of breeding with one of the stylish, scene-like 30-axes that Hollywood loved so much - and she calls him a savage and a brute, of "another tribe." Muni immediately turns to Mr Hyde and chases her for an unnecessary death. In the final scene, a reverse Muni tells his sober priest that he goes back to his own people, his own kind. End of movie. Finis. That's all she wrote. Muni is said to have employed a gene-oocean Mexican as a driver to study the speech pattern and physical habits of this exotic being. Yowza!
