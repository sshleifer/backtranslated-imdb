What a shame that a good talent was wasted. This is a boring and too self-conscious movie that could tell its story about half the time. Is it Derek Jacobi under the beard that makes two roles? Gosh, who would have guessed. <br /> <br /> The emotional payout end was weak and unsatisfactory. Certainly not worth keeping the padded length of the movie. I felt totally disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. First, they used stock music. Secondly, it was so loud during some of the dialogues that the words were hard to come by. Only three sound personnel and one trainee? There were several people listed in the credits for either posting or legal. <br /> <br /> However, some of the camera work was quite good and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Not a good use of viewing time, at least for me.
