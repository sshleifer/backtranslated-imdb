I watched this movie last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as terrible as I did. <br /> <br /> Granted, of course, some people see a lot in this movie that I didn't, so if you're one of those people, fine - good luck to you. But I'm a patient. I've had very long movies before. But it was an exercise in torture for me. I honestly felt that this was one of those movies with a little to say and that it was more about style than fabric - but also the style made me like to tear my hair out. Almost everything that happens during the movie is OFF-SCREEN. It is like a deliberate attempt to make a movie exclusively from outtakes - the bits that would normally be reserved for the deleted scene section of a DVD if they were shown to the public at all. <br /> <br /> You don 'I can even find out, finally, something about the protagonist, Francois. I had no sympathy for any of the characters in this movie, except perhaps the violinist and his goat and the old man who believes that octopus lives to 300 because they are very clever. I was seriously thrilled when it cut a shot of Francois with a gun in his head. I felt so ripped off as even his inevitable suicide turned out to be gut-wrenchingly boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? From smoking opium, too? I swear, I screamed almost every time I was exposed to an extended shot of absolutely nothing, except perhaps someone paced backwards and forwards, and finally there would be a very sudden cut to the next scene, and that would be a year later, and we missed everything that happened in the meantime and everyone was still wearing the same bloody clothes ....!?!?! <br /> <br /> So, if you liked it, concluded - great. But this review is intended as an antidote to fawning "you will love this movie if you love cinema" dross I've seen posted here and elsewhere. (See? I hated the movie and I still included a blurry flashing reference to the content!)
