I agree with many parts of the rather thorough review, already written on the subject of the miniseries, and agree that it has its advantages, not just its disadvantages. For example, the original film manages to shorten a large part of the novel's middle and final paragraphs in a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and Paul Atreide's and Chani's love affair, which by reading the novel is a travesty, probably born of the studio cut shenanigens as the other reviewer writes. This was one of the major flaws in the original movie, and the miniseries for his credit include many of the original plot lines cut out by the Lynch movie because of the Herbert novel's expansive character. <br /> <br /> But it's in itself a double-edged sword. Instead of completing a text-to-celluloid transmission of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to make their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. Likewise, it is of course a break from the original heart and soul and main vision - prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herber's writings and demonstrate what the many different characters think without suddenly changing their point of view or expanding into words or unnecessary and stylish spoken monologues? Away. So much of the original pain of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it, certainly the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one that captures people who are far from science fiction fans ) missing. <br /> <br /> Without a prophecy, what is the Dune point? It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad that this is all we are provided with. Lynch's films were flawless, yes. But a flawed movie can lead to a correction of another movie maker and take some of the best points in Lynch's film making and reject some of the more overwhelmed aspects of the style while restoring history. Now this story will probably never be translated into movies again, and I find that heartbreaking.
