Three words: What a pile ..... Two words: Do not disturb! One word: Sucked! There is no need to watch this movie. Even the Seagal groupings should depart from this movie. The martial art, the typical Aikido, is horrible. The martial arts moves are fine, but the cinematography is pathetic. The movie actually goes in slow motion when Seagal gives its "kill move" to its victims. Worse yet, the same move shows three times in quick succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's performance was simple stupid, but I still give this movie a "6" to perform because of the supportive cast whose "rogue" roles were actually quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The reason is just stupid. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. His character also has the dedicated work ethic, which means that all his packages are delivered to the right people on time - at no extra cost - and nothing stands in the way. Not killers, political leaders, explosions or even death. I expect some degree of violence in a martial arts movie, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrific acts of violence that in no way lend themselves to progress in the movie or its history. There is a reason why this movie went directly to video and there are many reasons to avoid it. No one should bother with this tripe. <br /> <br />
