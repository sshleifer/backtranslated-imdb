When I went to see this, I thought I liked the first two and thought they were very exciting, so it should be good too. WRONG! There was no excitement and they do not explain the new dinosaurs! When I finished watching this, I had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but it turned out that it was not led by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie went through the "movements". I thought this movie had absolutely no plot and I thought nobody should waste their money to see it.
