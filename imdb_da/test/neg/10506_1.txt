I hope the people who made these movies read these comments. The choreography was horrible, the plot was shattered, and the actors where so low budget makers seem to be 5 star for this junk. The battle scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move. Camera cuts and poor lighting could not cover the cheap effects. The lightning was simply stupid. The weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the double bow and arrow were just boring as something I've ever seen. Next movie you decide to do is try to invest in some wireless microphones, better script and actually try to spend some time on your stunts. <br /> <br /> Honestly there are shows on TV that ever play tonight and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one. <br /> <br /> Stick to martial arts (unless it's as bad as your play), then quilting.
