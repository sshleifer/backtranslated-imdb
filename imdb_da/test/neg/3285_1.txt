This is easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on television. I would love to ignore it completely, but Fox has fixed it in their Sunday lineup and forces me to find something else to see between American father and family guy. The imaginable male star guy is just the least developed, pathetic excuse for a man I've ever seen on television. Nothing on the show is extremely fun, and pretty much everything on it has already been done and much better by other shows. It's obvious that their strategy is to hit it deep and hard into the Sunday plan and hope someone starts to like it ... but I have to break it to you, Fox, that's the wrong hole. The scam didn't work on me - I'm just looking elsewhere - but come on, you freaking boneheads, this show freaking SUCKS, and it's even worse compared to the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup. DISCONTINUED ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS POINT?
