Of course I have disappeared in the movies. Neil Young concert film 'Heart of Gold'. <br /> <br /> There have been many good concert films over the years. The best is Martin Scorsese's 'The Last Waltz', who filmed the band's last concert at Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal movie, that is, if you love rock and roll and felt like you were born in it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two you could change the world ... as you can guess, I felt all five to the bottom of my twenty-four year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in 'The Last Waltz'. They had to digitally before they actually became digital, should they manually scrape a large hanging cocaine rock extruded from his nose, so in the film there is a strong light that is not the star of Bethlehem that kills over his lip and under his nose ... it's a famous piece of rock and roll history. <br /> <br /> But 'The Last Waltz' was made when Band and Neil and everyone else were in their thirties and 'Heart of Gold' was filmed last year when Neil is in his sixties and his band looks like whether they are in their late nineties, and the whole movie could be visually used by Christian Right and DEA in the same way as the Ohio State Patrol films of the full-run dangers were used when I was in high school showing death teenagers hang through front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and it's a great concert, open them and see Dorian Gry's hidden portrait. The case is that the once ethereally beautiful Emmylou Harris literally comes out of the dark to sing with Neil and from dark to light, which appears to be a ring wraith leaping full out of the river in front of Rivendale. Creepy, ghostly, a nose that does not look in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make buttons on the dolls look vivid and the ability to express any feeling, human or not, disturbed by unpleasant transfers in Botox. My heart reeled ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... live hard for decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris, whom I then sing for free at Fred's in Boulder, a face a 2000 year dead Pharoah would not accept. But the voice, just as clean as a thick bottle of Boulder beer brewed from Boulder Creek's waters, and I closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... you must remember at least once in any movie review ... to Fred's hamburgers at Boulder Mall and Steve Martin Pink Panther movie). <br /> <br /> It would have been a great concert in the darkness of the Ryman Auditorium, perhaps twenty rows back. But close, in close-ups, it was a medieval moral game depicting decadence values ​​and the consequences of a sinful life. <br /> <br /> Concert theme, emblazoned on stage, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, massaged guitars (I counted eight) and I wondered if irony was at stake. I do not think. An Indian bassist, a head guitarist who watched and dressed as Buffalo Bill, a piano player whose face resembled the screamer's face in Munch's The Scream, chick singers (in fact, matronly singers who mostly resemble one of the lost youth In senior United flight beams still plying the friendly sky) dressed in matching full length distressed denim dresses ... no it was played straight. <br /> <br /> None of them had seen I would bet on a mighty wind. <br /> <br /> It would be a good CD and would be happy to tell stories of hippy dippy Boulder when Neil was a long-haired Canadian crooner whose impenetrable texts seemed to mirror heartache and loss, feelings as universal as now . <br /> <br /> But only in a dark bar.
