Okay. I admit it. I'm a big fan of b movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens ruled. And even the bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, it's a bad movie that's just bad. Even a little cameo by Brinke Stevens (representing his role as Linda from "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years earlier) does not help this one out. A group of cheerleaders take refuge in a fancy cabin after their van breaks down. A psycho stems them one by one and catches them in different states of clothing. Bad script, bad direction and horrible actor make this a simple bad! Jump this turkey and let rent "Slumber Party Massacre." 1/2 *
