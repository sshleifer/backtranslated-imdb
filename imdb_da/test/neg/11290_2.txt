I must admit that I was deceived by the title and summary at the back of the box. So I popped it in vcr and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something good to happen. But of course it never does. The actors of this movie should be tied to a chair and made to watch "Saving Private Ryan". Maybe they would learn something.
