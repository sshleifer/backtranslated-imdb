The film starts a bit of interest in the son, who is interested in a teenage girl in her own age. Clayburgh's scary man is killed in a car accident as she prepares to go to Rome and sing like a diva. Matthew objects, but come together. He connects the young girl again, but this time Matt is on cocaine. His amazing voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's dependency. The film draws on after a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had the head in the moon as he was leading the picture. The moon has great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save your time. Maybe I'm too generous with 4 *.
