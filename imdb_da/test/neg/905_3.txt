Sigh. I'm confused when I see a card like this, get attention and tasks and what not. I watched this movie at a festival before the filmmaker got attention and immediately forgot about it. It was mildly annoying to see the swiping Grinch Who Stole Christmas Heart Gag along with the story, it put design many times before, the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style and story that goes nowhere. And we got "joke" to shoot the crows with 45 for the first time, okay? <br /> <br /> However, I guess what is really unacceptable is that it even floats its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE The tiny little death of Roman Dirge! Like any fast internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and open doors in Canada for a movie maker? "Give your head a shake" as Don Cherry might say.
