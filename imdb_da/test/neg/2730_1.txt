I was exposed to this pile one Wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law looked at it. I can't get over anyone who basically remakes a crappy high budget Hollywood flop ("CORE" with washed players like Luke Perry). If the high budget a flop, what makes people think about making the same movie 2 years later, where no budget would go anywhere? I was laughing through most of the movie because of how crazy it was (actually I'm shocked that it hasn't stopped legal rather than broadcast on TV) and how it was basically the CORE script just got redone badly, which if you have seen the "core" you know why it makes it worse is fun since CORE was NEVER so bad it was fun. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy laughing at really bad movies then this one will be right up your alley. All I can say is that I wish Luke Perry was able to have a career because he is not a terrible actor. He just lands terrible roles. Crappy made for television movies that only run on daytime television is basically a step closer to the end for him, if it wasn't for 90210 he would have a career.
