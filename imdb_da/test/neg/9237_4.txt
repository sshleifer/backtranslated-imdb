This for one has nothing to do with the amazing first flick. And of course we Americans just have to restore everything successful to English because reading the subtitles is SOOOOO Hard it is not! From what I've seen in the new trailers with the adorable, now pregnant Jessica Alba (yes it certainly destroys every teenager's boy imagination everywhere it doesn't!) It seems to be the same, but probably with the double budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery flicks I've seen in any language for quite some time. I would recommend seeing one and jumping this together, there is no reason to see this as there is no reason why this is even called "The Eye 2" except to take advantage of the excellent quality that was the first flick. Do yourself a favor, see "The Eye" with the volume up and get ready for some likely jumps. I watched it w / headphones on and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent Pang brothers direction. If "The Eye" remake works well as I hope it does for Pang Brothers movie career, but at the same time it seems a shame that people don't / can't see the original because very often / almost always remake isn't as good as the original. See this if you want to be a little bit boring, but the original is no comparison with this sequel in the name only flick.
