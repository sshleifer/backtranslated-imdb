I honestly don't know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well, humor is subjective eh? But yes, this show is incredibly unfunny if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. Al is annoying. next door is annoying. It's just more annoying than fun. The plotters are all the same, Tim makes Jill crazy and has to do things again. and the last seasons? less said about them the better who the hell, what cancer would be good for a strange sitcom? Yes, good idea jerks. yes yes, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I'd recommend looking at News Radio or Seinfeld. if i were to give this show a rating i would give it a 1/10 to see as it never made me laugh once. ever. yes yes, it's still better than The Nanny itself.
