'Book II' is not a movie, it's a sermon. This nausea, disease, and almost immeasurably boring misfire probably acts as a religious propaganda, but has no entertainment value beyond a few wisecracks from George Burns. Louanne plays a little girl who is asked by (ahem) god to mount an advertising campaign that causes people to believe in him again. No, that's the story. It is an abandoned crowd of old cobblers who have too much self-justifying 'explanatory' religious waffle, but hardly any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of something even approaching magic or charm. 'Miracle On 34th Street' is not. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a bit of life into this ranked sausage of fast concrete, but the pudding-headed script and rubbish performance of the Irish Louanne quickly sends it to the burning depth of you-know-where.
