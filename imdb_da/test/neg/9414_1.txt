I didn't have very high hopes for this. Before I saw it, the story cried "stereotypically" to me. <br /> <br /> I mean ... come on! It's so stupid the plot line about the innocent android who realizes that the people who created him are immoral, so decide to change everything. I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep because I was so incredibly bored. It is very rare that movies live so much that I fall asleep under them. The third time I forced myself to see it, simply to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I got the clear impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the cool / neat stuff from other scifi / action movies and put them together to make a kick-ass movie! They took the android / robot, lots of action, thin story, stereotypical characters and a big battle at the end and threw it together. Unfortunately, the film sucks. The action is so wood you can build a house out of it, the story / plot is absolutely ridiculous, the camera and editing are terrible, the direction is non-existent, and to top it all, everything is so clich√© and ridiculous that it just disturbs hell out of you. <br /> <br /> I was left with the feeling that I could have spent the time looking at this one, doing something much more creative, like trimming my nails or seeing the grass growing.
