A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To get it back to civilization, he bribes his way to the cargo ship on a great luxury cruise ship with fun and I think the script was for catastrophic results. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the one thing I really didn't like about this movie .... The monster just looked like a guy in a rubber boot. The CGI scenes looked like another movie. Okay, it's right from the chest now on all the enjoyable bits of this B movie. The best thing was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter's eye such a close second.) John was intermittent fun and suave and whatever the authors made him say, he said well. Good job given what he had to work with. The Egyptian zoo was over the top and fun to watch too, he had some fun bits. The Navy was all OK and made good gunfire to the monster who did some of the crew and guests. There are a few beautiful lines in this movie and a rather entertaining subplot with a thief. <br /> <br /> The special effects are generally low and I swear that they reused the same blood spray on the weight stage in about four different parts of the film. I liked the fun of the dead man. Right since this movie was not scary, I feel a little more would have gone in the way of improving the film's ability to watch movies. All in all if you like b monsters this is worth a visit.
