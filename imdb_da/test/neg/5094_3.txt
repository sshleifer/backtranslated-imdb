A good example of reverse politically correct racism, where white men are presented as meaningless brethren who are only there to be massacred and their aboriginal opponents as noble heroes, superior in their appearance and abilities. Apart from telling the story everywhere, it also prevents the neutral viewer from identifying with one side or another - it's just for simplicity. The repetitive score is incredibly annoying (as it is voice-over), the characters lack depth, and the viewer is quickly lost between issues such as "who is this character" and "what the hell it should mean". Photography is wonderful, and on the whole there is a lot of mood for it, but beautiful shots of misty landscapes alone do not store this movie. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an eye-catcher. In fact, his character could have been played by someone else, because it is basically just an empty shell (like most non-maori characters) and yet disappears halfway in the movie. But if you are eager to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, this is your kind of movie ...
