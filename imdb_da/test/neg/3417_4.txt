Aussie Shakespeare for 18-24 sets. With blood, blood and more blood. And good dose of nudity. This will not be for everyone at May levels, too violent for some too cheap for most. Made on low budget, they try and do it best, but it only works sporadically. And this macbeth just seems to be missing, it's just not convincing. Although there are some good plays on the part of most you do not come in there head especially mecbeths. The best performance came from the gary sweet and the strangest mick molly. If your in Shakespeare then see it, but if you like your cheese rip you will love it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not that good either. Sam Peckenpah would love it, that is if it was filmed as a Western. I expected a lot from this as I loved romps stumps. but it was a free effort.
