This movie was a low point for both Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. Large plot points are retrieved directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Upon a Time in the West" (released two years earlier and also with Robards): A man finds a hole in the desert that is the only water for many miles in In any direction, he plans To build a 'station' around the hole and to make sure there is a love he falls in love with a prostitute. To this is added an unfortunate preacher, bad music, stupid fast-paced action shots, even more crooked T&A shots - and there you go. There is little question why the ticket office succeeded. The real question is "how has it done so far?"
