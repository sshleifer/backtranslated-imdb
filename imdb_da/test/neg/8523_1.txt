Spoiler with plot explanation: A poor family is thrown in the middle of the war between the evil guy (who jumps from nothing and no questions are asked) who went wacko, and Casper's friendly ghost is trying to avenge his death. With each frame, the movie becomes more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending the seam is quite stupid, it has nothing to do with the movie itself, I think someone runs out of ideas or just comes to the point that the movie is this way or the other, so it might as well be one stupid end. Waste of time, resources and money. The actor plays is very bad. If you think of the dialogues, you can find out that family conflict is artificially enforced by poor communication between characters. Some scenes stitch randomly. In summary: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Waste of time and money.
