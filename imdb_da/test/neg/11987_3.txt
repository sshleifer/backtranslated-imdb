Uwe Boll slides back into his film-making skills once again to offer a scifi horror story of mercenaries and journalists taking super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast with the excellent Udo Keir is thrown in the bust of Boll, who makes the worst script that should have worked. The mad scientist investigated by a reporter has been killed, but this script is entertaining enough that the plot should have worked. In addition, the effects and super soldier designs with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of fragility, but Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off-handed way. It's as if he couldn't be bothered to actually find out what would work and instead stepped out of warehouse locations and walked away. In addition, the collection of scenes has no spark or life, I guess that Boll only shot one or two take and just used what he had. It really stinks. It is clear that Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films, where something he has ever been told about movies is being washed. The last movie he made was so bad, Seed was a serial killer movie, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is not so bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. Then Udo Keir is good enough that he does see his scenes worth the effort and make this an almost as bad his good movie. I would take a passport unless it is late at night and you catch it on cable.
