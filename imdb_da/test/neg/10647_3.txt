When the Hellraiser franchise reached its film, the premise was a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist of the future who, while the prisoner regales his prisoners of the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle box that hurts the world and how his bloodline subsequently had to handle the said box. The film is a flood with a lack of continuity in relation to the other films and a lack of coherence in it. Yes, it may be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the movie, or whatever. But I review the movie as it is and not what it was or could have been. And as it is now, it's mess. Sure, the franchise will continue indefinitely with direct to DVD sequels, but one was pretty much a dead end because it's the chances of getting a new one released for theater ever again.
