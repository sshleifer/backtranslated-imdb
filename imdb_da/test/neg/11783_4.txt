Jim Varney's first real movie is a great joy, but didn't come in to see Ernest P. Worrel anytime soon. I felt the large number of characters Varney depicted was fantastic, but without being told, the rest of the film should be put in a mulcher or something. A little strange beginning for a movie icon.
