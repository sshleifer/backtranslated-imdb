This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who is the only survivor in an Allied reconnaissance plan in Belgium in January 1944, is largely a mess. The title will make you think it's mainly a story of the Belgian armed resistance groups, but it just seems to be a backdrop to building a silly love story between Ted and Claire, the woman who takes Ted in. Claire's husband Henri is a committed resistance member, but Claire decides, in Henri's absence and against his wishes, to give Ted refuge. <br /> <br /> Important plot information doesn't make sense. Central to the story is the retrieval of the recorder on the downward level, which includes the navigation codes and the positions of the targets. But in the opening scene we see the Belgians plundering the plane, resistance members among them. Why didn't they pick up the valued stuff at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to come and guard the plane? And the whole case of transferring Ted out of the area was done using secret instructions and passwords as the transaction could have been a simple exchange. The strange music tries, but fails to put emphasis on this lukewarm business. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the movie is how love relationships develop between Ted and Claire. Initially, Claire is dedicated to caring Ted back from near death, and when Ted begins to recover, they are physically involved (while Henri is conveniently off-line). Julie Ormond does an acceptable job as Claire, but she affects a French accent, which I often found impossible to understand. Her response seemed a little weak at times - when she was informed of the deaths of several city members, she responded as if she had just been told that the local grocery store was out of peaches. As Ted, Bill Paxton just seems to recite his lines; His performance is so uninspired that it is embarrassing. A true American pilot can prove such a flat personality, but it does not provide convincing cinema. I didn't understand any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic thing is the way Ted and Claire work as holiday lovers. Perhaps sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable, but being completely unaware of the gravity of the situation is difficult to understand. Initially, Ted is sent to an attic and Claire cares that he himself enters the house. But as it evolves, he not only enters the house, he dances with Claire for loud music, enters the adjacent barn, where he can play baseball with a local boy and ultimately take a car ride with Claire to a nearby town. br /> <br /> The young boy seems to be most involved in his role, but he is undermined by the manuscript. He has a ghastly ability to be at crucial events without being noticed. And when he delivers lines like: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen someone hang. They look like they are dancing, but they can't find the floor." <br /> <br /> You feel it is the scriptwriter who speaks and not a thirteen year old boy. And for the purpose there are scenes to show that the Nazis are pretty bad guys. Comparing this movie with the brilliant "Asker and Diamonds" about the Polish resistance, or the straight stellar "Lacombe, Lucien" about the French resistance, one realizes what is a really bleak affair.
