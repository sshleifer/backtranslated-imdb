Breaking Dawn starts in a California college as Professor Simon (Associate Producer Jon Morton) tells his students to conduct an intensive six-week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a vital part of their education, failing and they will never Become qualified doctors. A bright, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) gets a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and is a doomed killer, he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) & her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first, Don will not even look at Eva much less talk to her, but like the troop she is Eva, trying to find him out. Finally, Don starts talking, but what he says frightens Eva, he says, someone looks at her and mentions the name Malachay. Eva then begins to see a dark shadowy figure on her every turn, as Don churns out the conspiracy theories and bizarre statements. Eva slowly begins to lose weight, as the line between imagination and reality becomes increasingly blurred. Is there anything more to the supposed nonsense that Don tells than to be the crazy ravings of a psychiatric patient ...? Posted and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have only negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now we all like a good twist ending, the kind of end that catches us unharmed, surprises us, works well with the rest of the movie and stays in our memory as the cool twist-endings of The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples and, to a lesser extent, the endings to films such as Scream (1996), where the murderer's identity comes a wonderful surprise and is not so obvious. Then, of course, there are movies whose conclusions destroy everything that has gone before. As an example let's take what I don't know, let's say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a horrible ending to a movie, never. Breaking Dawn starts as a decent psychological horror thriller with creepy things starting to happen with Eva, it's not the most action-packed movie ever on any part of the imagination, but it keeps their interest, it's not the most absorbent movie ever, but it is more than visible, and it is not so bad a movie until the twist ends, I have to continue to mention it because everything until that time (which was OK to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I'm sure there are people out there who think they have this muddy mess of an end that is considered to the smallest detail. All I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing satisfactorily to me and as far as I am concerned it does not make sense and will never. Breaking Dawn is crap, and it's a waste of time to see it being rewarded with the slimmest end in movie history, it's as simple and straightforward as that. <br /> <br /> Director Robinson doesn't make half a mess in what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought what he had shot would play OK or maybe it was destroyed in the editing room, but I could imagine that it was more likely to be a bad script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within a few muddled minutes and gives us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the excitement quite well during the first 80 odd minutes, but it is far too nothing at the end of the day. Technical Breaking Dawn is fine and it is generally well made throughout. The action is pretty good, Overton is nice and easy on the eyes and makes a decent performance. Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like the John Morghen star in such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980 ), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... Breaking Dawn is bad, I hated it all because of the last few minutes. Don't make me wrong, it wasn't exactly getting me tense up to that point, but it was OK. Absolutely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned, although it seems to have the fair share of positive comments on IMDb ...
