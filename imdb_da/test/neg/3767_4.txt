Rocketship X-M should be viewed by any serious movie buffer for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) It is one of the first - and few - movies that do not have a good ending. Without a doubt, the effect was deeper in post-war American America than it would be today, but the sad end adds the film's message. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first films to deal with space travel in a serious way that uses space as a valid framework for drama. Despite the lack of scientific background, the film stands alone as a dramatic fare. It is not so much a space drama as it is a drama in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The Anti-War Warning Announcement is delivered in a serious way that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animals. The impact of martial society from the atomic disorder is strong and honestly presented. The fact that the survivors of the expedition are colliding land and as such are unable to proclaim the doctrine taught on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic end. <br /> <br /> Sterno says take a ride on the Rocketship X-M.
