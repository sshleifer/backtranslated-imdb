I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times and it gets really fun every time. Perhaps what I enjoy most is the tired character paradigms that the film offers us: the gloomy all-American male protagonist, his blonde boyfriend, the theatrical dragon with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonistic jock and the brunette girl # 2. Two magicians with martial arts experts with mullets running a convertible. If anyone can explain it, please contact me. Among other highlights are Bobby Johnston's portrayal of the jock character, Dell, and his trademark line, "That's why I keep her around." When you see Johnston's performance, it comes as no surprise that his career quickly fell into the core pornography area. (SPOILER) Even after several impressions, I still have no idea what the big demon at the end says at any time; It's just electronically muted sounds. Oh yes that's enough for the better. And finally, why are all the demons so smooth? Is Wet Skin Scaring? It certainly didn't help in this movie.
