"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is always pronounced as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it quite disappointing. The main players are good - Terence Stamp ages beautifully, Guy Pearce has to do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses, and I've been a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him playing Oberon eons ago. The cinematography is amazing, but if you've ever been to the Australian outback, you would know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie similar to a Box Brownie and it would still have looked spectacular . <br /> <br /> So what's my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no sympathetic female character throughout the film. A woman who is to serve her life shoots penguin balls out of her private individuals on a roadside, deserves our sympathy. Tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment. <br /> <br /> Second, the stage when singing "I want to survive" to a group of aborigines is offensive. To try to draw any kind of parallel between the dragon drones and the trannies struggles and the almost total destruction of the Aboriginal culture, which I suppose the scene should do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. /> <br /> Last, and the biggest mistake in the movie is that it's just not fun enough. Did Stephan Elliott actually talk to anyone drinking queens when he wrote the movie? Anyone who knows a dragon queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have rapier-like wits and they are not afraid to use them. Now, I can understand that a lot of drunkards would probably have got the film denied classification, but Elliott should have been able to gather enough "fit for the Kiddies" material to complete his film. <br /> <br /> All in all, a waste of a good idea and a good throw.
