Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just to get a movie starring their two stars. Apart from that, I can't think of a reason to justify the movie's existence. Not that it is not fun in spots, it is certain, but the concept is so completely ridiculous that laughter is somewhat subdued. What really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to awaken my mind about the concept that someone is a police officer who is strictly a day job. When I was working at the New York State Crime Victims Board, I had to deal with all kinds of police and they ran the track between the really dedicated and some real snails, but I can't think of one who thought this was just something I do until I get my career in an area far away. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else go through the right Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a daily job? <br /> <br /> Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard-time detective who is on the track of a large arms dealer. He is undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does showboating Murphy call him a reality-based television series like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> Then, DeNiro's bust is blown high sky, but the show manufacturer gets some good pictures of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality-based television series. So these unwilling partners are enrolled and are trying to continue working with DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a fun guy, I loved him in the Beverly Hills Cop and the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /> <br /> I think Murphy would have a chance to work with DeNiro, and DeNiro should have a big pay slip to make this movie.
