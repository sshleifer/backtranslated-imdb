Make budget horror movies. If you do not raise your expectations too high, you will probably enjoy this little flick. The beginning and the end are pretty good, occasional draws and seem to go nowhere for long periods as we look at the insane who adds the atmosphere, but does not move on in the plot. Quite a few things to do. I enjoyed Bill McGhee's performance, which he made absolutely credible for such a low budget, he managed to carry the movie at times, as there didn't seem to be much to do. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well, so be prepared to let her go to the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes, but then that's what makes these low budget movies so good! I would have been out of the place and five states long before she even thought it might be a good idea to leave! If you enjoy this movie, try Committed from 1988, which is basically a rip off of this movie.
