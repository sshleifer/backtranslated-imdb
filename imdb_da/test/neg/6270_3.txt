Why do C Thomas Howell make these movies? Cruise (Howell's one-sided co-star) follows a huge block of WOTW and Howell with this lame effort. Where do I start here? Production Values ​​- I start with the good things. The appearance of some of the scenes in this movie is not so bad to be honest. The settings are okay in the spots and the direction is not that bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of bulky scenes that could have been put in any order you like to pervade the entire movie. How many times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was undeniable. Very bad story (but it was also Cruise WOTW) takes some guilt, but a scary manuscript kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Okay, I won't be too hard here when I imagine the budget was less than Cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the movie, the effects are poorly done. Some shots are quite impressive - mostly far away from the sources of destruction of bridges, Washington, liner. But in the main, the "foreign" machines and tentacles themselves are terrible. Also the camera's quality is unclear on some shots and cuts completely away from others. <br /> <br /> Works - I'm a fan of Howell, but he has reduced himself to appear in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the "over-acting" bug long ago. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He overdoses his facial expression, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get the running style ???) and to a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses his family picture. Hysterical. But after all that, he's still the best actor on show here. Busey is embarrassing to look at and Peter Green (Zed is really dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his only scene. I honestly couldn't understand a word he said - I even went so far as to try to activate the subtitles on that scene - but the DVD didn't have subtitles. This seems to be a true keep-it-in-the-family affair as well as Howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it to the movie. None of them are good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> Score - Dismal. Overall, a lame duck bet will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how to make it back to the A list, but if he continues to do things like this, he won't have a career soon enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
