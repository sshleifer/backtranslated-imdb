First World War gets a shiny, sepia-toned makeover in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's relentless moody "A very long engagement". Jeunet's trademark style consists of a mechanical, almost clockwork-like narrative design garnished with lavish, chocolate box production values ​​and seasoned with faux-naive humor. It's an approach that worked quite well with its previous image, the romantic fantasy "Amelie", in no way thanks to Audrey Tatou's impenetrable contribution in the title role. Used to much more gloomy material, Jeunets method goes pretty hard. Tatou reappears here in a variation of the same kind of sweet off-beat character as Amelie. She is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic landscape setting, determined to track what became of her child's boyfriend Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) several years after he left the war. Manech was one of five soldiers who became the right of self-destruction in 1917 at 'Bingo Crepuscule', and sent as a punishment over the top to no-man's land. He is supposed to be dead for everyone, but Mathilde, who cherishes the hope of finding him. The film follows Mathilde's dog-like quest to find out what really happened, and as she dives deeper, she discovers a sad and even shocking story of high grain corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde will filter the facts from the fictions derived from various conflicting, overlapping or incomplete accounts of what appears to be Manech's last hours. All this must be exciting and gripping, but it is more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal root that Jeunet pummels with his audience. There is simply too much going on at any time, including an intrusive narrative that just doesn't add our perception of history and characters. Without a moment's respite from informative congestion, I felt denied room to reflect on Mathilde's quest or space to engage with it on my own terms. Jeunet's incessantly recorded camera spirals and swoops and circles stretch every superficial contour of its exquisitely designed production, but it fails to penetrate the soul under the skin of history. The result is deeply involved, and worse, grotesque. The First World War was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine being recreated as one of the picturesque advertisements of a well-known Belgian store and you have the measure of this movie.
