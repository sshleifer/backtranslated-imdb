Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and is thought of by local folk to be a witch. Kate seems too hard and tries to convince us she's a backwoods hick (called Trigger Hicks!), But you can see that she doesn't even believe in this unintentional comic scenario. Constant smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam, which becomes Trigger's first crush ... but unfortunately he is married! No amount of white magic can revive this formula based on a game and brought to the screen of R.K.O. with too wide a hillbilly blossom. It is wicked and just about uatches. * 1/2 from ****
