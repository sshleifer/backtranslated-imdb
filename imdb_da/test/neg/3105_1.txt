I am actually in the mood to write this review - bad movies always do it for me - but I feel obliged as if it were my civil duty to warn anyone who might be considering buying or seeing this godly messy image . Please, just take my word: This is one you want to stay away from. It's so boring and boring, so incomplete and uninspired, such a bad excuse to gather some familiar talent. Burt Reynolds? The waste (despite his best efforts). The Ice-T is barely in the movie, and when he appears on the screen, his performance is so maintained and subdued that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps frightened by the intense stirring of the ice, did not know what to do with him. Rob Lowe, as a title character, has never shown so little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles was ashamed of himself; His performance is, in the extreme, possible a joke. Satan certainly signed Mario's check for this movie. The reason is so weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music involved (the completely boring club song seems to continue, literally for the first third of the movie). The film's appearance will cause you to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced to smoke crack from a tube channel that taped to the mouth, as one of the film's forgettable female characters. And if you at least look for stylized, shoot-up-type violence, you get no one here. This movie, I assure you, I promise you, has absolutely no redeeming qualities! Please, I beg you, avoid this girl! Don't put it in and get suckered into believing its pace will pick up, it gets better and progresses to a decent degradation. It won't. It doesn't. It can not! It stinks! Now you have been warned and I can now go to bed (it is 3:00 am - please forgive any errors that this admonition might contain) - knowing that my conscience is clear because I have done my civil duty to my fellow man!
