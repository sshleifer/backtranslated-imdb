Very forgettable story, where mercenary Kerman and employer Agren enter the jungle in search of Agren's sister. <br /> <br /> Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this movie is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's "Guyana - Century Crime". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the current Jonestown massacre by portraying a villain, self-righteous zeal with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (the game with the ruthless intensity of Ivan Rassimov) leading his modley crew member to self-forgotten . With a sister in toe, Kerman & Agren tries to stop the rat, but after several failed cups, they stop fleeing into "Green Inferno", only to fight for the locals and their infamous desires. <br /> <br /> One in a series of great gore feasts emerged in the late 70s / early 80s, with each new addition appearing to engage in a one-up competition with its predecessor by trying to reach the most gory and graphic screen ever brought to film. This subordinate installment utilizes all the other motives and gimmicks, but with much less success. Was it the so-called "Indians" who looked as if they were Bollywood rejects (this film was made on the spot in Sri Lanka) or the creepy "decapitation" and "castration" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was evident in "Cannibal Holocaust"? You can decide. Without destroying the conclusion, it seemed as if Lenzi put more emphasis on his shock and awe-climax than in the basic requirement of a coherent ending where all loose ends are solved. Most unsatisfactory. As with the others, where the scale of the graphic depictions of violence against humans is limited (fortunately), the filmmakers have not spared any extreme to cause the worst possible cruelty to unhappy animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only thing that shocks this movie is that it mentions, among other things, ilk who deals with the subject more convincingly. <br /> <br /> If there are any redeemable features at all, Kerman is a gracious, if one-dimensional, leading man, and his gaze of sharply stuck fellows (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provides visual respite from the relentless slayings.
