Like another user, I got it cheap - I thought. DKK 85 (Â£ 8). Although it's not worth so much money, it's a unified classic that I - just like the other users - first saw when I was a kid and looked forward to seeing again about 20 years later. The story is incredibly thin (that's why it could have worked for kids), but all radio language and trucker stuff do it well. It looks good on my DVD shelf in the coming years. First Vision (1980): 10/10. Second view (2002): 4/10
