I can't believe anyone gives this movie a good rating. In addition to the terrible action, thin (non-existent) Plot line and slooooooooow pace, it would be the movie to see if you really tried to fall asleep. The minds of the writer and director must have been fried eggs that have ever chalked something as horrible as this. Based on the summary of the DVD case, the premise was promising. But within the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see a REAL creep and take on the Area 51 idea, check out the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland will soon fade away as all pathetic films in his ilk do. NEXT!!!
