This movie is not even good enough for the $ 1 bin in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> I just bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. Guess he couldn't be too emperor about his roles during this time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was hard to sit through. It seemed that they grabbed a litter with a story. "The night out of the boys" had to be the most boring I've ever seen. One minute do they talk and the next reciting poetry? Even the arguments were difficult to follow. Most of the play lacked any depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what to do with this one, but they certainly missed the mark.
