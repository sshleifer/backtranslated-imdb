I'm a big time horror fan and I bought this movie from all the hype it was on the message cards. Well, let me tell you, I don't know who gave it all hype, but let me talk about a few things. First of all, this movie is "not" a lot of things. It's not scary, not exciting, not too gory, not too sick (except in a season can) not beautifully scored .... All in all. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the movie is that a couple fly to a small island in Greece because they have done a little infinity in London. We don't even know what they did, but they are supposed to kill someone. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler alert ** <br /> <br /> The male leader kills a few people out of his perversion of "cleaning island perverts" strangely enough. The killings are cheap, the signs are cheaper and the effect sucks. <br /> <br /> There is a lot when he rapes a goat because his wife won't give him anything in the morning, but even that happens without care about how it's shot. <br /> <br /> End of spoilers <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is about the only thing that is not entirely predictable. I especially enjoyed when "shepherd" farts on man. Anyway, if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead. It's nothing better than a greased cheese sandwich on moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
