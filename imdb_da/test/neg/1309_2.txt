Miscast, poorly directed and terribly written, this can be seen if you have an hour or two to kill or suffer from insomnia, but only. Robert Carlyle fully realizes his potential as an actor of highest mediocrity with only one expression of his repertoire (that of a chronically constipated football hooligan fighting a crippling inferiority complex), which he sometimes needs to change a little by flaring his nostrils and Carrying a series of crooked yellow teeth (this to indicate anger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.) In his role as "the best marine engineer in Britain" and the son of a university professor, he is equally convincing like my neighbor's cat. Tom Courtenay, just miscast, slurping and distrusting each line, appears permanently soused into eyeballs, and seems to be unable to tell a flood from a sausage of his own urine if he was in it. All in all, another silly attempt on the British side to imitate Hollywood pulp at its most rubbishy. The dialogue is a series of poorly delivered clich√©s; the plot is uneven the plot is pointless and amputated; And the characters, if you can call them that, don't even do it in the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
