I can tell with the other comments that NOBODY could ever enjoy this little piece of shit, it's the same way I felt. All the time I looked at it, I was appalled that everyone could make a movie this stupid! What is the world coming to? I think it's my fault to sit through the whole movie (ugh!), But it was like a bad car wreck I couldn't see away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under 8, you like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from it at all costs. It's the stupidest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid - the story, the script, and especially the play, everything! While watching the movie, you can either turn off the TV and think "how can a movie be so sad stupid" or continue to look from curiosity to see if things can be more stupid than this (they can't). <These filmmakers (if you can call them that) need to seriously go back to their daily jobs, not one of them has an ounce of talent, and I doubt you can survive terribly useless garbage bin. that no one in their real mind will ever see! <br /> <br /> Just pulled out BS Don't waste your time.
