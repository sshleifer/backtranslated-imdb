The gate to Hell has opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to town to find a friend who has disappeared in the tunnels below the city to find the gate. Walking around the earth, he and his colleagues must deal with tunnels residents both human and demonic. Good idea with a good deal of other tier actors does not go as much as the tunnels that are its setting. I've seen this twice now, and I still have no idea why this is supposed to be scary when there isn't a lot of other things when people talk about evil and we see shadows. Nothing is clear and honest, I did not see anything but giving a paycheck to the people involved (another image Val Kilmer is in a few fleeting scenes that do nothing but allow him to be billed as in the movie.) The idea is really good, the performance is good, the script goes nowhere. Take advice from several of the characters in the movie and not cross the river to see this.
