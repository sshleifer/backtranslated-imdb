This movie was a waste of my money. it was disgusting and disturbing. Honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog? seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I continued watching the movie, hoping it would get better and a plot would show up, but it never happened. I would rate the movie an F-. This film should have been classified R for its disturbing nature. I would never let children of all ages watch this movie. this movie sucks. This movie is horrible. this movie was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night doing something worth my time instead of renting this movie. This movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and certainly wasted two dollars to see it. Virtually no one should watch this movie. this film must be banned and burned.
