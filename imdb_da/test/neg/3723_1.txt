WARNING! SPOILER! This movie is absolutely crap. It's not entertainment. I do not have the words to describe the disgust I felt at the end. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly made film about the soccer frenzy. Throughout the movie I kept waiting for it to improve. It didn't. Instead, it just got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie as bad as this, I always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. In this case, it proved impossible. I don't have a good thing to say about it. How bad did it get? Well, here's an example: Dan Akroyd forges and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! This is not entertainment!
