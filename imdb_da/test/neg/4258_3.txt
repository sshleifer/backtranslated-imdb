Nishabd means wordless. This must be the condition of the script before the recording of this movie started, and therefore this whole movie shouts about content. What you are looking for is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl, and what you get is very common, very common events that neither surprise nor surprise. So what we're back to is with quaint places in Kerala shot brilliantly by cinematographer Amit Roy and camera friendly histrionics of newfound Jiah Khan. This does not cover the lack of a concrete script. Producer director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good track record on film, must pull up his socks. As far as Mr. Bachchan goes, I will not discuss him in the context of this film. <br /> <br /> As I go through, I feel the loss of words. I'm left speechless, rather wordless! Personal Opinion: This movie is comparable to an equally bad movie that released something called BLACK. I can't see the difference between hegnionics of lead grades in both films. What did you say right now - It was a world-class movie blah blah and I have no taste. Well, take a walk. No, I don't mean literally, but actually to the theaters that show this movie. Because you might find this movie an Oscar-level material.
