This movie has to go down into the fictional annals as one of the worst of all times. I will stop saying it is the worst movie ever, just because I have not seen any movies ever made. I can't make such high demands on that then. The story is outdated, the play is terrible, at best, the "special" effects are no more than a few lbs. of dry ice and a fan. Someone should have been related to someone to get this movie made. Sir. Busey sent this to! The dog is well-educated and sweet, making it the only redeeming quality in this film that should never be made. Two hours and $ 3 in my life I will never come back.
