This is a horrible movie and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible. It is ugly for one with the trendy 1970s visual style that might seem to be a good idea at the time, but which now allows you to instantly recognize a movie from that period as being a 70s product. The film preserves the story and the songs that made the scene version of musical such a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But for the most part, because of Lucille Ball's poor performance, which you think might make some of this bigger than the sign of life, if anyone could. She sleeps through the movie as a frightened actress who stifles her opening night, and the movie sinks with her. Even though Bea Arthur, whom I turn to, was fun in the best friend role on stage, can not breathe in this stink. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Degree: D
