Some folk friends recommended this, but as a film, it really lacks originality. I found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning. But if you like traditional English / appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. I also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie, where professional musicians fill in for the actors.
