This was a scary show. In short, it was about this child named Doug, which was due a lot. Seriously, he could feel guilty of killing a fly and then feeling guilty of guilty of killing flies and so on. The animation was lattice and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. <br /> <br /> It aired here in Sweden as part of the "Disney time" show, and I remember that it liked some what, but then I became 13. <br /> <br /> I never got why some of the characters were also green and purple. What was it about? <br /> <br /> Really a terrible show. It actually happened to be a movie that I have never seen, but I have no great expectations either.
