*** SPOILERS *** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in England may be the worst movie ever made and brilliant just for that. A sexy rich girl stands up with a robust action man to search for her sister in New Guinea jungle. What follows is an indescribable crap mix of cannibalism, crazy cultures and religious maniacs to be seen as being believed. The cannibalism scenes are quite awful, but are so badly staged and acted that they are quite entertaining. Cast is awful except for Janet Agren as the female manager who is excellent. Watch the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint! My rating - 1 in 10.
