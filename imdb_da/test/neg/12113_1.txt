I want to preface my review by saying that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the 60s ghost movies. I do not own anything, I have never rented anyone, so I may have to miss the understanding of these heavy-in-kind, low-budget stinkers that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on Cinemax late on a Saturday night with a lady friend. Don't ask me why I saw Cinemax late on a Saturday night with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some terribly bad plays by Misty Mundae (and I wish she wouldn't own up to being from Illinois as we actually show some very bright thespians here) caught our attention. Now normally, the purpose of a good softcore porn will be to get you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex, heavy in cheek humor, and who knows what could happen? After approx. 15 minutes, and a scene where the title character seduces a violent victim, said my friend: "If you want to see the rest of this fine, I go to bed so I don't have to. Turn off the sound." Here's what I collect from The plot: Misty's character is a sexless geek who is bitten by a spider and turns into a super-pretty kitten with super web slinging forces that do not come from her wrist. There is a kind of vicious evil that is not particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, MJ (who is man in this movie) is constantly exposed to stereotypically bad homosexual motorcycles, and somehow the evil scourge is pushed out of a building for her death. <br /> <br /> What was good about this movie? It ended. <br /> <br /> What was bad about it As a play to make a third-class movie screen look like Oscar winners, a script appeared out of people , as I picture to be drunk, colleges aged sex, s if would not know what sex is if they took a class taught by Dr. Ruth, special effects that were about as special as someone who jumped out of a trampoline, humor about as much fun as ?? Well, I haven't yet come across anything that is lame. Gender scenes? If we saw a video, the only thing that the scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. <br /> <br /> Now, I know that this type of movie is supposed to be enjoyed for the inherent evil. Companies like EI do not seem to make good movies: they have a niche and they are aimed at it. My experience as a marketer tells me that they are entitled to the money in servicing their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe' I can once say that I will not soon enter that world again. Perhaps the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they pay so much attention to making the movies bad, that if they made an effort to focus on the things they do very well, they would show some very funny 'le bath' cinema, a la Troma movie in the 80s. Sorry guys; The spirit is there, but the effort is not. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me ??
