What a sucky movie. This is undoubtedly a low class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers attack Russian bunkers and resemble an old WW1 battle. The action is mediocre, the plot is thin and threadlike. It is sometimes difficult to follow where it goes. The action sequences are rather worthless (when it shows something), except that they use authentic World War II equipment / vehicles. This is by no means the same level as "Saving Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". Lots of worthless attempts at character development that lead nowhere. Old theme good officer / poor officer who is very predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12 year old child set them up. I could have done better. Too bad it's the same guy who did "Das Boot (The Boat)" because it was a dang good movie. He must have participated too much for that success because he has probably lost touch when it comes to this movie. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it instead.
