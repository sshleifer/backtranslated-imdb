This movie lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor in a major city, and New York is certainly as big as it gets. Would allow a village in his village to degenerate into such a fierce place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. All the victims in the film were mostly older, Jewish or defenseless. At the age of 62, I have never seen a film depicting such a lack of respect for authority that this film did. Even "Escape from New York", which was fictitious, front, ie. they told you that this was science fiction, did not take into account such deep-seated violence. In this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized but had weapons but were not willing to use them. Also in this movie and I have not seen the two previous ones are more lawless than the "Escape" movie. Second, as far as my studies are concerned, gangs have never been as cooperative as this film makes them. On the one hand, they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he is killed. But when heroes start shooting at the local gangsters, next time they are welcomed with open arms. Outside group members are always seen as outsiders and stopped. We must believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs will be in it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I think more than one gang from the outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question why was the gang leader in prison and why do prisoners ask his permission to attack Bronson's character? This wasn't a good movie and I could go on, but I don't.
