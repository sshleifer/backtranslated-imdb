What a ridiculous waste of time and money !!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. Hype was a warning. I am disappointed by Julia Roberts, by far she is the most talented cast member. I think her ability to really act has borne the film. Buddy buddy boys club was a little too fake and to add disgrace to injury why bother throwing Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to destroy a movie. She lacks the ability to have on-screen chemistry with anyone, not to mention she lacks the ability to act. She lacks chemistry with the other characters: kind of reminiscent of "America's Sweetheart's". She made the "Terminal" terminal. This movie is headed nowhere, what a shame, please do not tell me "13" is coming!
