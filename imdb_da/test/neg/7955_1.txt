Pathetic NRI Crap ..... Appeal to anyone who is not Indian .... This is the WORST of Indian film made of the worst piece of NRI waste ..... The story is boring and clich√©d (the way NRIs and Westerners see India) ..... Go to it if you want to get bored. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the widow's fault in India before independence. Much of it is true even now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent depicted (perhaps because it is a period movie) ..... <br /> <br /> There are lots of other Indian movies directed by extremely talented Directors who are worth enjoying. .. One is a particular miss ... See a documentary instead or look up information on the web if you are really interested in the situation of the weary in India. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time.
