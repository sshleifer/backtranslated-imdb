I really wanted to watch this movie - I thought the plot was unique and exciting. A police officer (Andy Garcia) has a son who dies and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. The only match is a doomed serial killer who escapes from prison. To save his son, he must trace the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the prisoner in one of many disappointing aspects of the movie. Keaton is a great actor at times, but here he is pretty boring. It's over-the-top to the point where you just stop breaking. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better but trying too hard for a movie that is not up to each other. Barbet Schroeder (at one point, such a promising director with films like "Barfly" who is hardly anything on the American market) is good enough - I honestly thought the manuscript was guilty of this ... it's just a big mess. br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is spilling very good material, good actors and a good instructor - all because of an erroneous script. What should have been a tense and thought-provoking movie is just a Hollywood action dud.
