I know most other reviews say this movie was great, but I disagree. It's probably a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was very small. But it's just not meant for theaters. Maybe for half an hour card, but I can't see how they can make a short kiddie book for a whole feature film. It's a cute movie, but I'd only recommend it to really young children. Older children have no interest in it. Adults can have a little more interest if they see it with their young. But any age 7-adult will have a sneakiest. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you disagree with me, but that's my opinion. :)
