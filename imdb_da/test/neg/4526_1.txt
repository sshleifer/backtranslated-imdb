Don't believe the hype. If you have high hopes or have expected this movie to some extent, you may be disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can't save this badly-written, outspoken, stupid spy girl. For the purists (fans of the original TV series), this film has a little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) are simply not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is more than a bad shadow of the TV version. For those who are not familiar with the original TV shows, you may not be disappointed, but chances are that you will be bored. There are also a few cheap Hollywood political shots (really pathetic and oh so typical of an election year). We left after the first hour and were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
