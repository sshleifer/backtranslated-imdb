Other reviewers seem to have kept this film in high regard. For something made of an eighteen-year-old movie studio I would say bravo, but that is not the case. If you want to see a good movie about graffitti stick to documentaries. It's filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are gloomy actors, and it would be okay if it was a student movie. The plot follows a lone artist, like skateboards around Portland, writes graffitti. He is connected to another, and they skate around together creating art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the dispute between those who are never actually discussed because this movie has as much dialogue as a Charlie Chaplin image. This movie shows the gravity the street performers give their shape well, and the music is great, but generally I wouldn't really call it a movie.
