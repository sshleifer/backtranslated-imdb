Though it's better than most TV movies, "Buried Alive" is no more than a huge revenge story. There are so many plot holes in this one that makes you wonder why the scriptwriters didn't go through a series of rewrites. The end has a good twist to it, but it is hardly credible. The actor of Jennifer Jason Leigh is amazing as always, but Tim Matheson hammered it up with cheesy one-liners reminiscent of one of Jack Nicholson's "The Shining". Don't bother with this one.
