Really? Is it necessary? How can anyone make such a movie? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with fun hair and fat as an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars pursuing with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention Ending. Absolutely nonsense with the presence of the little girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal will be Robin Hood !!! Now, a fortune begins to matter, no one has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must fool. Steven Segal goes after a car prosecution and I know he can't act. It was awful. Nothing can save that movie. <br /> <br /> I lost 90 minutes in my life! See you
