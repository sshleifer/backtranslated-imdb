Inane, horrible farce basically about a young man who refuses to observe or better uses non-conformity to achieve his goals - fool his parents into believing he is attending college. The truth is, this shake has been rejected by any school he has applied for. After seeing this junk, you'll see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name-South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out the initials of this schoollessness. The problem with this type of film is that eventually it becomes non-conforming to the accepted state. Let's go back to reality and call this movie what it really is - excessive manipulative junk!
