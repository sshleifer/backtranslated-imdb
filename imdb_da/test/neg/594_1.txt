Don't waste your money or time. Horrible movie. Bad play, plot everywhere. Really, really bad acting. Man, this movie is simply bad. I shut it down after 7 minutes. The script is bad, the management is bad, it seems to me that a high school group came together to make a project for their drama class. Yes, it's so bad. The action is convincing at all, remember that I only saw 7 minutes of it. How this movie made it to DVD is beyond me. <br /> <br /> It should have been left in the editing room. I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, I will definitely not do it next time: _)
