Am I the only one who thought this movie was the graphic violence? I didn't know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented it and wouldn't have done it if I knew most of his previous films were horror movies. I'm not at all, I just expect an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing about it for me was that it made me want to read the report to find out what the gentleman this movie was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because I'm shocked that we have become so immune to violence in film and on television that it wasn't even worth commenting on by the blogs if the reviews I read.
