Simply, this mini-series was horrible. Let me count the way. 1. Absurd plotting. 2. Overriding. 3. Scattershot access to characters. 4. Annoying narrative 5. Inability to create viewer interest. <br /> <br /> This movie can't even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. I'm sorry I didn't read this award-winning novel, so I judge it only as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the large selection and will taste them, but suddenly they are pulled back and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, with too many characters introduced and never pulled out. There are enough stories and characters in this movie to create a 20 episode series, but we get less than four hours to digest everything. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reaction images of Ed Harris than you I find at 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extraordinarily slow. <br /> <br /> So far, Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so over-the-top that their characters are not credible. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The persistent river metaphor becomes thin. <br /> <br /> And the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. This evil and avid cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers - Well, come on now - it's not even good Stephen King! Probably the most interesting character in the movie, and the one that is not well-drawn is John Voss, the disturbed boy whose final desperate company accounts for the only plot unit that works in this movie. Just about everyone in this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> In summary, there is a little here to inspire. The drama is bad melodrama. It's just a horrible effort.
