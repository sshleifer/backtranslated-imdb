Now any Blaxploiation fan will recognize the ingredients: big aphrodisiac, topless babes, surreal bad fashion and some jive speeches. In this case, a management that cannot act adds a low meaning plot, editing a person without hands that has been folded and the most fearful fighting scenes, and you have 'TNT Jackson'. Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, this is a wonderful root from start to finish. I especially loved the endless errors of continuity and the white stunt double of the lead. <br /> <br /> This is so the '70s bad Far Eastern martial arts encounter black power that it hurts, but boy it hurts so well! I am ashamed to admit that I almost enjoyed it.
