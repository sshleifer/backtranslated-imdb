'You're in Navy Now' is painfully bad: probably the worst movie Gary Cooper ever made. It is apparently based on a true story, but the event that inspired this movie does not seem to have enough plot to maintain a function-length script. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on local television while I was a house-sit for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. There was a raging snowstorm outside, and I was literally twisted. If I had been able to get out of the door, I would definitely have stopped watching this movie. There are some interesting names in the supporting cast, especially Charles Bronson (under his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the normally reliable Millard Mitchell is horrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are on the screen so short, there is no point in looking at them. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays a fuzzy marine officer who is required to control a ship driven by a new experimental steam turbine: largely the entire ship is a huge teakettle. Cooper realizes that the task is not a prestigious one, if it were, it would have gone to a better officer. Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply had no ability to comedy. He made several bad comedies, and this one is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me, and she bored me more than usual here. This ship went down with all hands and sank without trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I rate 'You are in Navy Now' a point out of 10. Toot! Toot!
