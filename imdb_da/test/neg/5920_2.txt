I thought this movie was horrible. I understand it was shot on a small budget, but the play was terrible and the movie itself was just stupid. The reason was predictable, and the central character was an unsympathetic moron. In fact, all characters were unsympathetic and no one was fully developed at all. The audience does not concern anyone in the film. It should be exciting, but if you don't care about the characters, it's hard to get into the movie at all. I felt like an outsider who is forced to listen to someone, tell me a stupid story. All the plot turning at the end was just a little too much - I was actually laughing when I assumed I should be "shocked". All in all, I thought it was really just a bad movie.
