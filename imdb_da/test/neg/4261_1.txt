And the worst part is that it could have been good. But something terribly wrong. First thing first, they shouldn't have thrown Amitabh Bachchan into this movie at all. He is too much of an icon to tackle such a delicate and controversial issue, let alone the role itself. <br /> <br /> Second, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed of herself for taking the classic story of Lolita and turning it into a pathetically predictable veil. His Lolita is called Jia (played by beginner Jiah Khan), and when we meet her, she is devoid of any incarnation of stolen innocence or the delicate naivety that would normally relate to the complicated narrative of the original Lolita, as in the Initial history, gradually becomes nymphet. Varma's Jia is already a whore with her eye on the prize even before the camera meets her. And he carries no chastity in the way his film is his leading nail. From constant panning of her steps to fixations on her vulgar movements and manner, Mr Varma ensures that he has not left a person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic pedophile camera angles. <br /> <br /> Let's not talk about the non-existent chemistry between Jia and her so-called friend Ritu (Bachchan's character daughter). These girls should be best friends, yet look like worst enemies before anything goes wrong between them. Nothing they do together is trustworthy until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr Varma should have been working on this aspect of his script, rather than focusing on destroying any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan may have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is perhaps the entertaining portrayal of the character of Bachchan's character wife. Her role was so undervalued and ridiculous that it is impossible to actually feel any shame or concern for her. In fact, I felt like entering the screen and relaxing her not to react like any normal woman would. Instead, she just stood there looking annoyed and helpless when I imagined that much of the viewers of this movie might feel after watching this train wreck of a movie. Look at your own risk.
