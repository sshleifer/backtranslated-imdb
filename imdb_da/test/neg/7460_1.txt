No, I'm not a radical feminist bashing the hentai and the yaoi genre, I just find it really boring and meaningless. My God, I was made to see this to start from some stupid punk and my mine, even a MST3K movie has a story, not to mention that this HENTAI crap is what gives Anime a bad name all over the world (beware of Sailor Moon!). Unfortunately, people are not aware that not all Anime (or other Asian styles) are twisted porn.Death to the stereotype! <br /> <br /> * begins to throw Ultima *
