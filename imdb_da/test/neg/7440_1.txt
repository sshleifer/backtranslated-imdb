It is a pity that they do not trust the original enough to build on it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" takes the original amazing ideas, imagination and characters and replaces them with all the stereotypes that successors have to offer. <br /> <br /> The beginning commercial was sweet and it was also the scene that follows (reminiscent of the start in "Guys and Dolls"!) but apart from a mindset here and there it is a movie that is slow and dirty struck down in the middle of nothing. br /> <br /> Ideas are introduced, so dropped, interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they wouldn't stop whatever movie, and then there is the tone. <br /> <br /> In the blessed original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to lead with that kind of attitude, where if you distorted the attitude and feel of a good pulp cartoon, even the most repulsive violence would be entertaining. Kershner (although he directed a "Star Wars" sequel) does not. And the scene after the stage also makes you ring, look away or just tune it all out. <br /> <br /> And what's with RoboCop ?? He should be the most important thing here, right? But there are whole scenes where he doesn't even come up, and which scenes he is in are so half-thought and shaken, that you do not know or care if he is a partial or partial citizen - since he is boring. <br /> <br /> Never have I seen such a rapid fall from grace. Why does Hollywood make such bad followers? Intentionally? Why; did the filmmakers make a bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; The FX is good, but the story doesn't even try to match them.
