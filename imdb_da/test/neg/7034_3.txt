I actually saw this movie at a movie theater. At that time I worked shifts and went there under a matinee on a hot summer day when I couldn't sleep. The cinema was air-conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was an early multi-screen complex and I somehow got into the wrong venue. I was going to double through something else. But when things happened, there was no sleeping. Shortly after, the wrong movie started, I was also alarmed by a group of female cleaning assistants who came in and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and it is a goal of the film's appeal that they usually expected the place to be empty and asked me if I voted for their presence. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Within half an hour, the detergent conversation turned out to be more interesting than the entertainment I paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie was out of the screen with cheesiness of very outdated mayonnaise. The kind that has a little dark, hair, tufts grows on the surface. In particular, I remember that my senses are being attacked by strict wires of music that would blow out with very little warning and even less importance. The cleaning staff gave an expectant cow by putting their fingers in their ears. It was a matter of some city birds living in the founders of a burden, a backstage who put them straight, but at the same time learned a moral lesson or two themselves. Like you do. A kind of "journey of discovery". There was a centered smugness about the whole production. In particular, the leading actress had an annoying habit of staring at each hick with a kind of intense blessed compassion, as if she were herself patron saint of thickies. <br /> <br /> At some point I believe she wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Far in the end, I was fascinated by one of the cleaners' wives and breathable tails of sexual inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> A suspicion that there are some who sit still for a few hours and do not have to think constitutes a meditation. The best thing I can say is that I don't want to share their salad. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this movie announced as shown on TV, which surprises me. It's just the kind of cardboard that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs. <br /> <br /> If you ever work shifts, be sure to enter the right theater. Or hope for some cleaning ladies.
