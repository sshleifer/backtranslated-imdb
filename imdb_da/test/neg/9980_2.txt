Probably not the same version as most other reviewers because there is no really hard core sex. What do people at hard core sex mean? That kind of explosive hard core sex is seen in movies with Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Anyway, it's really bad movie, I doubt if I've ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a movie. The script is really bad and plotty, director and film is horrible, and editing is non-existent. It's really a horrible movie. You could see this ten times and still don't understand what the hell it is about. The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks, and a giant lawnmower comes together and beheads them. Yes, you read it right, a movie set in Roman times has a scene with a gigantic giant lawnmower! <br /> <br /> Trivia points. Many years ago, a pirate copy of THE THING (1982 version) made the rental rounds on my island and was copied on a rental band by CALIGULA, which means that the pirate version of THING starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA from man and woman go through the forest starts the title sequence of THING. These led people who had seen the pirate band believe in the forest scene were the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 film and were very confused with what it meant. Well that's what you get to rent pirate videos. But after seeing the whole CALIGULA, I don't know what that meant
