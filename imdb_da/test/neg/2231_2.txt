I rented this movie and knew it would be bad (I only saw a good Disney sequel and it was toy story 2), but it went much lower than my expectations. I'm a die hard disney fan and I just don't think of followers of Disney movies. For anyone who didn't grow up with the classics (either to see them when they came out or hire them since you were born), it's a sweet story. I just feel that the plot was pulled out a little too much and was predicting. The only thing that annoyed me most was the voice of the girls' children of lady and tramp. They were too high. Although most reviews say it's not that bad, I think if you're a true disney fan, you shouldn't waste your time with this one. Hopefully Disney will do nothing more to any of the other classics any time soon.
