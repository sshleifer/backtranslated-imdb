This is an old-fashioned movie. A young couple crawling around a strange mansion, said to be driven by Satan, running from and into each other by an unhappy crew member: a lady in need, a monkey, a monkey man, a midget, various unequal people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero is obliged to play a "prize is right" kind of competition with a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. For my taste it is too much of the same. The crawling around in the cozy corridors is entertaining for a while and becomes so repetitive. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy doing the same in two wheels, it's not really fun. Nor is it scary, and apparently it was not supposed to be: the household is too absurd. Most movies in this genre balance the comedy with a real threat, and usually two - one that the characters are led to believe are genuine, and another, for which it is a cover. Here, the tire must not be taken seriously, nor is it covered. A few moments of fun come from the mix, but it's pretty much fun. The novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller, and I think could have been played just for better effect - and still could be.
