Frankly, I am amazed to see that this movie gets relatively good reviews. I want to be honest and say that the only reason I got through it myself is because of Ryan Phillippe, and not for reasons that are particularly related to his acting as an actor, though I believe in the last few years. that he has proven to be a better actor than his first lead in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As for action / excitement movies, this movie goes in almost every respect. The action is ok, but it is terrible and the script is very sensible, a fact that the filmmakers are trying to cover by adding absurd references to chaos theory, as if it would convince anyone that the movie is actually "smart" - but then again, judging from other reviews were some. Don't be fooled: the script is a boring, derivative root and no other element of the movie makes it possible. Wesley Snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a movie, and Statham is a thoroughly boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
