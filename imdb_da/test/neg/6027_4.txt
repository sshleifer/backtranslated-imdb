In fact, I had a lot of parts of it. It had some interesting phrases. But it left me right with one there, seen that feeling after all the SAW movies. Granted the end was different from a typical saw, but let's look it out ... a group of guys, unknown to each other (or they think) threw together in an abandoned chemical factory .... <br /> <br / > But then it loses something. There is no intensity, there is bad group dynamics, there is no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Some great twists at the end and definitely worth seeing if there is nothing else on your plate, but it just left me empty. .. it was time, but it did not.
