Barely came through the whole movie ... It's bad, dialogues are even worse. Felt a little st00pid 4 to watch it, but it was called the same as one of my favorite games so I struggled through. They screwed up the sound themselves. On certain parts of the movie, the background music is so high that I had to turn down the volume. It would be great if it was a competition for who can turn more. <br /> <br /> Oh and PS: I don't know what this guy "Uwe" is capable of creating ... I definitely don't think this movie is bad just because he's Manager. I checked the list of his work, and this is his first (and probably the last) creation I have seen. <br /> <br /> over and out.
