When I saw this in the cinema, I remember that it was bad to appear in a minute or two in the first scene, and then I tell myself no, it must get better. It didn't. The performances are rather uniform teakne pine and no, there is no sexual chemistry in this movie, just the awkward posture of a relatively comely, discreetly talented actress who seems born to reach the entrance to "Interviú" and not much else. If the screenwriter seemed to make Mérimée a sign was an amazing original creative trick, he might need to come out more. And Aranda, if he had been given the matter a little more thought, would have realized that Carmen's story just breaks for a thought-provoking, iconoclastic, parodic deconstruction, not this abandoned-brain-on-the-swing affair of ersatz passion and comic-book dialogue. This is the modern Spanish cinema at its worst. <br /> <br />
