Yes, I had the accident watching this movie when I was younger in a friend's house when his mother was a teacher, and she wanted to screen the movie and see if there were inappropriate scenes that a parent could object to. Well other than the creepy jokes, I think this was in the clear, well the creepy jokes and the strange scene where the look that Ernest hit on a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into prison thanks to a similar appearance and continues to try to escape, and there are other things as if being magnetized at some point, shooting electricity and in a very painful looking final flight. There are a few jokes, but nothing too much to mention except the gun carved from soap ... I think this is the only scene I or my friend's mother laughed at. This and the camp are the only two Ernest movies I've ever seen, and from what I've seen in them, I won't track the other movies. Ernest was good in small doses, but a movie is just too much, even when it is as short as this one. I reckon even if the movies made money, mainly because all you need is Varney and a location and a theme and you have your movie.
