This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think horror movies should try to come up with more imaginative titles, though the story is about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest and other related religious sects. The basic premise is very simple that a ghoul dressed in a Nun-garb that it can claim the title goes round and kills former monastic girls. There seemed to be some sort of conspiracy, as the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played with an eye skin Icelandic Anita Briem), continues to discover using some good friends as a rip off of I know what you did in last summer (also mentioned by the way). So as the body count rises, it's a race against the time of our emotionally savage (aren't they always?) Heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. Delving into the sins of the mothers made the film unthinkable, with a dream sequence as the introduction. I hate dream sequences as it is a pretty cheap technique if not done properly and there are a few of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> In part, the movie sometimes played as Ju-On went wrong with Lots of Dark Water references, and they could have retitled this Unholy Water, for the circumstances and plot points in the movie. However, there are plot holes in abundance so don't look into the story too deeply. You will expect the standard textbook to turn to the end of the sadistic nun and set as if they could compete with the recent Thai horror movie Dorm. <br /> <br /> The play is beautifully forgettable perfectly strongly accented English. And since most are pleasing to the eye, history must weave in a love scene in the midst of a witch hunt. What gives? Hey, have you heard, you still have mood ah? Then again, ghoul is a pretty cheap animated / SFX that has a built-in AI to pop up every now and then, in different ways, just to evoke screams from modest audiences. The characters also break every unwritten rule in Do-Nots into horror lore so you know and expect their only desserts. <br /> <br /> Can you possibly enjoy this movie? Of course you can. Just make sure you see it in a full house (should be easy, as local people are suckers for something far awful), and laugh at those who are so jumping, they scream at every "scary" scene. It is quite fun and adds to the atmosphere, beyond what is happening on the screen. Surround sound does not even come close. <br /> <br /> Think of it as seeing an episode of Scooby Doo without wisecracks, and it's a shame that the good moments in the movie had to be censored for a PG rating. These might have been the best bits, now left rattan on the censor floorboard.
