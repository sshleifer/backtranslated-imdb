I just watched Icon on DVD and despite being a big book, the movie is a weak substrate from it. Those responsible for the writing must be banned to Siberia. Why they save the big story with all sorts of C-movie subplots that are completely irrelevant to the story is completely out of my mind. <br /> <br /> But the filmmakers and the casters make it best to do something about it, but at the end the film was not at all satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Can anyone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it's done. I'm sure the crowds will rally for such a masterpiece turned into a book, not for a cheap C movie.
