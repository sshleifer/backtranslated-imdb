Christian Propaganda ... Lots of fear mongering ... This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction). The movie started OK but took a sharp Christian return. From then on, it was only about God, Jc, the Holy Bible and the devil. The UFOs are really just demonic deception to fool people into believing there is another intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you into believing that there could be more to life than what is in the Bible. The abductions could be used to explain the growth. The people behind would think it was a lot of alien abduction, instead of God taking all Christians to heaven. No need to repent if its foreigners. The deeper message in the movie is if you do not believe in God and have JC in your life than you believe in nothing, and your life has no meaning.
