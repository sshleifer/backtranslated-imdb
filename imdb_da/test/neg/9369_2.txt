I usually don't write reviews for shows unless I've seen them fully. But there were so many positive views on this show here, I felt it needed to balance it with a bit of realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I don't think it was supposed to be, but it is. I see that there is a lot of praise being burned on the show and I honestly can't understand why --- this show is so poorly behaved, the dialogue is so awful and the plot is thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it's a clear litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and perhaps these elements are just more important to some people than those who do not work, making the show almost unmatched to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy making fun of a show as you look at it, anticipating clichés and so on, this can be a pleasant show to ridicule if you have that kind of time on your hands. The pilot is a pretty good example of the whole show. If the nonsense saccharin cliché does not leave you in a stupid shock, then it may be a show for you.
