My mother brought me this movie on a DVD. A guy in a rental recommended it. But it can actually be the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I don't expect much from this movie, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even fun and it was meaningless. I was looking forward to seeing Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved step by step. Even she was a huge disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the parties is dead (he wasn't actually dead, he woke up later), the house looks like a bomb has exploded, and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. But then there comes a gay policeman ... There is a total mess to the end and the guys managed to tide and all in like 15 minutes ??? Come on, just be realistic. Waste of money. Really...
