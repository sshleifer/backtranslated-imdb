Aside from the look of talented Austin Power's imitator Richard Halpern, this image was your run of the mill's movie spoof. Dated movie references do not help audiences who can cross this effort in the future. Look for "Groovy" Austin Powers in the hot tub. It's a half and a half. <br /> <br /> The bad special effects are overcome by the appearance of many starlets in skimpy outfits, so it must at least keep one entertained (if that is what spans you). <br /> <br /> For my money I would rent the DVD of classic spoofs like "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
