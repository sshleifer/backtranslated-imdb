The real surprise of this effortless lightweight movie is how such a top cast was assembled for what is no more than a hammy uninspiring affair. Probably it was a magic snowball that rolled down a hill that totaled pace and size and shape. One can imagine that when Miranda Richardson was contacted by his agent, the conversation went in line with: "Do you want to shoot a movie in Dublin written by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already in!" a boring 'comedy' that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran trying to pull a well-planned hustle and bustle, where Moran must imitate a London gangland manager (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a large sum of money from local kingpin Michael Gambon. Simply an unforgettable body that is fortunately over quite fast, Moran is mildly fun in places, but on this evidence is better suited to the life of the small screen in hit comedies like Black Books.Caine is undisputed in his role and gives a stable performance Without being overstretched, you can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it hasn't even been a summer in Dublin, as many of the scenes look positive in the background. Actually the show, and anyone who has got some of his performances as if I have news for you, will know he is a wonderful fun man. But overall, the result is disappointing, and it seems that Neil Jordan made quality films of the same as Mona Lisa.
