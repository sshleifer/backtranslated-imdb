I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy mocking them in my friends' company. We are all pretty good at it. That said, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe is attacking some people they catch him, but he escapes in this great olympic shoot out. There is this song that we believe died, only she did not, unless perhaps there are several of them who all act and look the same. Cue Burt Reynolds comes in and asks the singer. He looks like he just walked into this movie out of Walker's Texas Ranger set and is darn confused. So Rob Lowe dies, only he does not ... And the worst is that there is not enough dialogue or action that does not mean killing people or trying to make fun of this movie !! And don't even get me started on the random chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it was about the old power structure in Eastern Europe falling apart. We didn't know where we were, all accents were apparently "Eastern European" and what was Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe there in the first place? <br /> <br /> I wanted desperately to tell the people at Blockbuster what I was thinking about this movie and to get my money back, but when I got it as a special (only $ .99) I decided against it . What I want to know, however, is how the director got GREENLIGHT to make this darn movie and what "the stars" thought when they signed in ???
