There were two things I hated about WASTED: The Executive and the script. I know I open myself to ridicule, but Stephen T Kay's direction is too much like one .... as one .... good as an MTV pop video. It's shot (I think) on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack, often out of focus and often with quick cross-cutting. If you're not a teenager, you'll find many segments of the WASTE unpacked because of the stylistic approach. As bad as the management, it was the script that gave me the chain. The story is told through Samantha, a poor little rich girl who uses a large part of the movie that speaks through voice over. (Nice how the voice over never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character) tells us about the pressures of her exams, home security, her social loneliness and that's all that led her to take drugs. It is for similar reasons that parents break up that her two male friends (I thought she should be lonely?) To start taking drugs. Oh poor little Sammi in her beautiful house and her problems, how my heart blew for you and your chums - NOT. What the waste does not mention that no matter what a person is dependent on whether it is drink, drug, nicotine or chocolate, the person must work to become an abuser, they are not victims of external forces, they commit to the act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING made this point very good, people become addicted because they want to. Describing them as victims in any way is wrong patronizing and very dangerous. <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTVs are anti-drugs, will they stop playing videos from stars freely admitting drugs?
