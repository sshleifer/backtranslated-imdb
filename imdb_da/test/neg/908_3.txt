The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized by "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better movie by Terence Young, starred with Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There's nothing new here - the hidden object in the doll, the bad men who want it, the bad guy makes a good guy. However, the handicap has changed: Audrey Hepburn couldn't see, the child in the DS can't speak. But both stories are related to the disability. Where "Wait for the Dark" built up excruciating excitement, "Dead Silent" lets you guess the outcome, the story is such a stereotype.
