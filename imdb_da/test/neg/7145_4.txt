There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing you haven't thought of before, nothing you haven't heard before. The story of a gay man brutally murdered in a small town and the people's reaction can in many ways be pampered, and this film has chosen the most demagogic and slushy. One of the biggest mistakes in this movie is that it is neither a movie nor a documentary. The director used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it were a movie. The result is weird. And finally, I read in previous comments that people who don't like this movie are anti-gay. I'm pretty sure these comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant, but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie. This is a fun world.
