In a year when "Singin 'in the rain" and "High Noon" was released, this overcrowded turkey somehow won the Oscar for Best Picture. Half of the movie is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both take over although they are models of restraint over the annoying Hutton. Hutton acts as a self-centered trapezoid artist as an excessive high school student in a poorly-crafted school game. Grahame is the only cast member to do a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, only by creating a long-acting play, no matter how boring.
