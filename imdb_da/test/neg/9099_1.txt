When you see the first moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it's a parody, but I'm not sure what (an adventure? An opera? A Hollywood C movie? - if there was such) and I can assure you that it is not worth seeing. It is simply a meaningless movie (cf. A good parody is anything but meaningless), with pretentious, superficial speeches about extremely outlined characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sung in a deliberately incompetent way (something Greenaway will use much more effectively), it is * painful to listen to (unless you wear some sate-of-the-art ear plugs, haha). Go to quality movies (for example, A. Mitta's How Czar Peter the Great married his marsh, 1976) and evade this mistake.
