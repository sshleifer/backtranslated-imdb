A horrible, horrible, horrible movie. I saw the original when I was a kid, and it gave me nightmares in my teens. When I found out a remake was on the way, I moaned. WHY OH WHY REPEAT A GOOD MOVIE? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for bugging yet another classic horror movie. This time they have replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pacing and gab-inspired characters. Someone previously said he was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Uh, did you watch the movie? She's playing a little pricey tramp. Sounds like typecasting to me. In fact, half of the people in the audience fought when she died! It tells you why people watch this movie. If that's your only reason, find a better one, because as a black hole this thing will suck more of your life than you want. Had I been alone, I would have left 10 minutes in the boring exhibition. This thing is like a moron guide to crap film production: In wide southern git, stupid but attractive driver, knives a lot, do a lot, make threatening truck, I could continue. After watching this movie, I really started to appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and I thought the movie sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crap party at all costs.
