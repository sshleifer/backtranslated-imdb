Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 stunk, but the first one was better. Special effects in this film were not at all special. Although the killings were better at this rate, they were nothing to brag about. One thing that was worse in part 2 was the signs. They suddenly changed feelings and some of their lines were just stupid. For example, a character quoted, "You have better some R.E.S.P.E.C., or you will find out what matters to me." When I heard the line I was expecting, it was the worst I ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was that it was too short. A successful movie should last more than an hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2. If Full Moon does part 3 of Killjoy, it would bow to the lowest level they may be able to go. Overall 1 out of 10. <br /> <br />
