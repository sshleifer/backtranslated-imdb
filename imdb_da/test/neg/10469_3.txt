Yes, it was that I felt after I had finished watching this movie. The play is below average, and the special effects are terrible. In fact, the worst I've ever seen. It's a very low budget movie. There is no way that this movie can scare you, it has no scary or scary moments. Mr. The bone eater was more of a fun creature for me. It could have been much better, but well, they didn't have a big budget. The movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol. I will mention this movie The Time Eater (waster). I'm sure you would have a lot of better movies / etc to watch. Still look at it if: 1. You have nothing else to see. 2. You get to see it for free. Not worth renting at all.
