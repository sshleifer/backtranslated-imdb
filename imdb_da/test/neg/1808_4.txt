After reading the book, Heart of Darkness, the film did not do it justice. The film puts the book to shame, and anyone who has not experienced the book would fear the story and the plot because it was pronounced so badly by the film. In the film, characters and sets were only some of the disappointments that arose in the movie. The director released so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever done. <br /> <br /> Of course, every book is better than the movie, but these were not even comparable. Joseph Conrad as author was brilliant in vocabulary and intelligence of the written word. The movie doesn't even begin to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely omitted, just as Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Even when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intention, she reacted differently to the film, rather than the book. Another big difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady who was folded at the end of the film, not at the beginning, as the book. This was influential on how the audience perceived Marlow and the movie was completely shaken. <br /> <br /> The book was so fine-tuned on what each location looked like, but the scene in the movie was a disappointment. There were a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment, a bunch of bad actors to follow. There was an exception to the horrible actors, and it would be Isaach De Bankol√© who played Mfumu. His character was best depicted. Although the movie was not that great, I would still recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way, you can see what the differences are in film and book and consider them. If you haven't read the book, I don't recommend the movie because it's a boring, lifeless mess. I loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
