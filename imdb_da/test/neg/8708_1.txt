This film rejected from the Bible and then fell under the line of the 1956 film. I hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally 10 bids. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the friendly looking Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I will not waste my time again watching this movie. They tried so hard to modernize this movie to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one). I am quite sure that the younger ones out there who have never been aware of the original 10 bids may disagree with me but on their own. It also took them 10 years to make the first 10 bids, it probably took them 2 months to make this. Special effects were not as amazing as the first and after all those years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
