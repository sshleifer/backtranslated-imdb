Film Noire is a genre that requires some degree of tact, wisdom, intellect and imagery. This movie has none of it, even though they really tried hard with the picture. It's the kind of movie that your cousin Marky dump truck driver who always talks about how to make it big in the movies would one day do. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is wood and lifeless. The visuals, although of course expensive to make, are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably because of a serious lack of cerebral abilities. The play ranged from sub-par to simply poor. The story could have been rescued by a real writer and director, but I suppose such people would not have touched it with a barge. About 1/4 of the way through I noticed striking similarities with the scene in Sim0ne, where Viktor, desperate to get rid of her actress, makes the world's worst movie. I figured I would check the IMDb to see if a similar effect has taken place in this movie, and to my surprise it has. I would almost be tempted to give 2 out of 10 just because it's exposed to the pretentious groupings, but I won't. It's so bad.
