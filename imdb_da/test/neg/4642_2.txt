Okay, well, I'm a fan of the low-budget horror that, along with it, comes the occasional piece of waste that even the most daring fan of campy flicks can't bear to witness ... TRANCERS 6, directed by DEMONICUS's Jay Woelfel. First of all, the TRANCERS series, started back in the mid-80s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise it is due to Tim Thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trance hunter jack deth Well, low and see , due to the sinking budgets of the Full Moon features (which, in spite of what people have said, have actually included very high quality features like HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson did not return to the Sixth Full Moon author Courtney Joyner returns and delivers another below average manuscript containing Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks, which is extremely poorly inserted ... he has another hair style every time he is shown, and some "shemp" is on a table) goes down the line into his daughter's body. Well, from here you have "Yes Deth" like Jack, but it's a shame that she really doesn't give the same screen presence as Jack Deth did. <br /> <br /> The movie, shot at 16mm, is simply a shame for the TRANCERS name ... no offense to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you that I actually want to jump out and make a TRANCERS movie without Tim, but with a little more time (even though it was filmed since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br /> Watch out, however, the Full Moons DVD of the dual function with the original TRANCERS and features trailers for the last 10 plus Full Moon features. All in all, I would have liked to have wanted more if it didn't have TRANCERS name, but as something, you can judge it by a person's opinion and you should check it yourself!
