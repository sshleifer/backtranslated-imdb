Even though I've seen Sal√≤, I don't know if excrement tastes tart. If it does, this "movie" is the title title. So much of roughage, so little substance, it's the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it doesn't clean the palate. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if I could discard this movie and come back that expansion / expense, I would. Retention was more exciting. The director must be forced to wear a dunce cap, and Ed Wood Jr.'s spirit could not save this semi-professional projection from certain errors. Waste of time, waste of mind. ** Don't be fooled by the dental Dominique Swain: competent eye-candy, she was in Lolita remake, less tragic and savvy than Sue Lyon, but by no means better. However, a formerly competent propeller does not make her a skilled craftsman. You need craft for it, not shit, which is what this movie is. The wheels belong in the girls' bathroom, rinsed to the pipes burst, while director / direct-less Christina Wayne was to make 5-10 study halls. See something else and pass this class off (goodbye) forever!
