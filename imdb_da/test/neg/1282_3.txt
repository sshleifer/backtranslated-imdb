Everyone grew up had a lot to live up to and there was a lot of hype when this show was proclaimed. Now it's easy to explain why it didn't live up to expectations: First, this show failed to create a realistic world of pre-teens in the way Rugrats captured the world and the infant's imagination. Second, the show's character is stereotypes (Angelica: White spoiled blonde as opposed to Suzie: colored girl from the modest family ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and annoying (Dil). Finally, there is no ounce of innovation or an original plot line. In summary, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel to a show like Rugrats. It is boring, lacking in imagination, and it seems that manufacturers do not even know how 10-13 year olds behave. To be precise, shouldn't Angelica and Suzie compare bra size instead of struggling over who is better at making duties?
