*** CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was super excited to see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, okay, so both parents are dead ... maybe it'll be okay. But then the rest of the movie came. When it was over, I was furious. Nothing was correct, but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite all the time ... and then the movie goes and makes him a complete heartless idiot?! The film also showed the shifts or werewolves, as these false, evil creatures were, as the book shows them, who just want to fit in and keep their package safe. They would never kill people for fun. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie like they did, they should have given it another title and name the different characters. Because then I would go out and see it again and buy it, but when I think about it, I can see that it is bad. You couldn't pay me to see it again or buy it.
