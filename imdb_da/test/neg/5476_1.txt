This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell - and did it. Really awful unclear / inexplicable coincidence and unidentifiable plot line, all without signs or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get clich√© snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the small and beautiful criminal chief who prepares an excessive "hard guy" persona and casts a depicting shadow of intimidation over the actual hard guys who have been brought in to work for her. Nothing very sensational to look at in the movie except for a shot when the boys hit the road, and one of them carries a small suitcase (as the smallest from a complete American tourist) in a light, sky-blue without explanation or apology. Otherwise it is standard visually - another exception is a convincing shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.
