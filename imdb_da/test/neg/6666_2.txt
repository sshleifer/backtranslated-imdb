I bought the DVD of this movie because I am a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the movie is so boring and slow in development that you just want to turn off your TV or DVD player after about half of it. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera, but not in a television movie. William Devane was okay in his part and he performed quite well, but he did so much better in other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm heart mother to the viewers. Instead, she played very cool and was no better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely cannot recommend this movie. Save your time and money for this.
