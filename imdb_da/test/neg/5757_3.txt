Director and FX man John Carl Buechler doesn't have to do much to scare me; The sight of his name in credits alone is enough to hit fear in my heart. his regrettable straight-to-video exit in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section of my local rental store; Twenty years later, his DVDs record the same room. It seems that the more things change, the more they become the same. You can rely on old JCB to earn, regardless of format and regardless of film production progress. <br /> <br /> In this tender offer, a bunch of friends travel to a remote city where they discover secret treasure jackets by Jeremiah Stone, AKA the fourteen year old ?? a vicious, hopeful, cannibalistic miner who caused chaos in the mid-1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah pursued anyone who was to find his gold, and it is not long before the chopped killer returns and encounters the rude tax candidates. With its horrible script, unimpressive make-up effects and Scooby-Doo style villain, 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is par for the Buechler course. Only genre stalwarts Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever, with the rest of the cast giving performances from bad to terrible (though I forgive Alexandra Ford, which is a complete hottie). Even fans of bad horror horror will be disappointed as most women wear their clothes and many deaths appear off-screen (which is probably not as bad as the doors on the screen are pathetic). 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is another in a long list of duds for John Carl.
