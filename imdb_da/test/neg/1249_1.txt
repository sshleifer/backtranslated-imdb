This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Which weakly wasted Michael Imperioli's obvious talent. Real movies from start to finish. All I can say is that this director is not 'author'. You never once enter the game, the character's head, the amazing talent with the real Stuey figures. Coke's scene is bad enough to throw your shoes on the set, it could have been a great scene if it had been shot at movies and not the scene, with the camera halfway across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it, while drama is going far in the background. The scene where he wins the big championship is just laughing ridiculously. This must be screened in Film Production 101 - What not to do by making pictures.
