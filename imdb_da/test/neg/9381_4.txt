Although allegedly autobiographical, this film shows little insight into both the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as in larger scale historical processes, and my hope of learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found my feelings a little bad when a series of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other, frightened, tortured or killed the malicious prototypical middle-class Iranian whose western cultural sympathy was patent (and whose freedom the film is quite obviously seeking.) The deeper to understand the film that appears to be demonstrating is for the mass media market, as it serves to approach predominant western folk ideologies (ie, a "crowd pleaser"). <br /> <br /> What made the movie from being totally boring was its creative animation - true minimalist imagery, which nevertheless always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no tiny fat that I give it some stars.
