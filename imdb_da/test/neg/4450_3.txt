I just watched that movie and was pretty disappointed. I did not expect much to start with, since the film's premise does not yet indicate greatness. Unfortunately, it doesn't even deliver just as stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably the actor. While I've seen far worse actors in far worse movies, history would require some people to act as violent maniacs, some others like people caught a really stressful situation, and they fail to deliver it. Although I saw the German release, I saw the original sound, so it's certainly not just bad voice-overs or something like that. In addition, the German DVD release seems to be cut, the murders are largely omitted, which means that apart from a few semi-smooth scenes closer to the end, the German release does not deliver as a movie to "gore dogs" , either. Cannot comment on it for other releases of course. The reason has some stupid moments thrown here and there and the beginning is just fun (ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). Too much, the film takes it all too seriously if it was filmed as a horror comedy and changed a little here and there it could have worked better. The end is just a big disappointment. If you really have nothing better to do and just can't stand boring anymore, you can (and really a weak "maybe") consider this movie. If there is anything else available to see or do: Select the alternative.
