... But not this one! I would always know "what happened" next. We never know what happened because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I'm a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind, and I couldn't have been more offended by the movie. I compared "Scarlett" to the original GWTW because any movie that was worth following GWTW should be at the same quality level as the first one. Rhett was beautifully beautiful, though no one will ever compare to Mr. Gable. I'm also a strict Vivien Leigh fan !! She was Scarlett. She fits the bill. Not another actress in this life or another will ever fit the same shoes, but with "Scarlett" the job could have been better. It was not enough to think about finding the right Scarlett, it was clear. <br /> <br /> All in all, to look at, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest writing it yourself or finding a fan fiction. This movie is not worth the time.
