Granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of the cinema. The script was profound, so bad that I almost cried with laughter on some of the things they came up with. The play was almost as bad, they would rather have beaten traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). The murders were ridiculous, the excitement was non existent, the camera's work was ineffective, and the "big" plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it just got worse and worse. "The Granny" may be one of the most unpleasant "crooks" caught on film, she looks like she has a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair causes endless amounts of laughter) and a cool nightgown. Would you be afraid of that ?? I was definitely not. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay movie ÔÅä) then this is a must see. Those who do not like bad movies and do not enjoy laughing at a shockingly poor dialogue, like the plague.
