This horror story takes place in the Namib desert in Africa. A Canadian system analyst, Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow), is sent on a mission for a diamond mining company. Although he hates fieldwork, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert-fighting sand flies and whips, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found ... well what's left of their scattered bones is discovered. During a long cold night, a changing monster gives its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are horrific when their truck is stranded, and members of the unit die terribly one by one. There is no sign development; let alone dialogue to talk about. The desert in its own way is beautiful and without giving away ... the creation is as old as desert sand. Also in the cast are: Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai.
