Not much is actually happening in this movie. There are a few pivotal moments and everything else speaks of a crucial moment that takes place before the movie began. The primary mechanism used in history is the feedback. Flashbacks can be used very well, but they are not here. There is no indication when you blink back or forward, and there are only weeks that separate events, so context as a scene unfolds is the only way to know when something happens. Maybe it was supposed to add a sense of mystery to places, but it was pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing a 100 minute screen discussion of why are things and a lame questioning good against evil, enjoy. If you see close-ups of a mostly free stirring on Ryan Gosling's face, as much of the movie appeals to you, you have good luck. Unfortunately, I can't find any reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as another review indicates, Spacey is only in a cameo role here and plays with an uninterested detachment that you've probably seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest contains spoilers even though a few major points are held back *** <br/> <br /> First, the so-called retarded boy kills before the movie opens and we never learn what exactly what happened. The implication is that he was killed to stop the deep grief conveyed through the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions, as the characters beyond the boy and the management are very one-dimensional. As for what is with the protagonist ... Another review suggested he is crazy. I agree that he is not 'real' but does not know that I would call it crazy. It looks as if the film was trying hard to convey that he was either autistic or retarded somehow, for he seemed to be slowly and unable to understand the obvious. Either that or they were on their way to a neglected youth with some detox disorders and / or who were heavily medical. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at conveying something to the audience, but it seems exactly what was deliberately put in the air in this case. This movie gives no answer, just questions, but it was a sufficiently bad movie that I really don't care about.
