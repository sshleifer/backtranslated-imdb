Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A movie produced and like and a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback cannot be expected to be high in artistic profit - and in this case it is certainly not. In fact, the audio track, as expected, is a much better investment than the movie itself, as the rock and roll lifestyle of the 70s, it tries to portray, is characterized by profits, drugs and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately it is not nearly equal so funny. By using a writer by Carl Dupre terribly enough to make an actress and wasting Edward Furlong's talents, the only highlight of this rock and roll period has gone wrong is the music, especially the elaborate rebuilding of a 1978 KISS -concert.
