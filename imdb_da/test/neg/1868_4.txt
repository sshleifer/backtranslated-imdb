Some things just won't die. They just have to hold back for more, whether we like it or not. I think some people like to beat a dead horse. The first 'Ghoulies' were a surprising hit, and it was the first sequel to be an even better movie. The third film took a more comical approach, and at that time the little bugs began to exceed their welcome. I think someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a good idea to revive the franchise, but the result is likely to disappoint fans from the previous entrances. Benefits: The action is actually pretty good for a movie like this. A stupid but fun score. Moves at a good pace. Some cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good action-packed sequences. Has a bit more plot than the others and, unlike the II & III, at least tries to connect with the original. Cons: Not as much fun as it's predecessors. Although it has more plot than before, it is quite ridiculous. Poor effect. The original Ghoulies appear only in flashbacks, and here they are replaced by two trolls that do not serve any purpose other than being comic reliefs. Talking about comedy, every attempt at humor is lame. Is a direct sequel to the first movie, but there are so many loose ends. For example, I thought Jonathan was finished with black magic for what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular in the others, but this movie is really gentle. Final Thoughts: The first three 'Ghoulies' films are a bad movie lover's dream. This fourth and so far final successor (Let's hope) is a bit of a letdown. Sure there is something fun to get, but it's just not the same. The others are also low budget, but those involved involved much more in them. See if you are a complete or you want to see beautiful women in skimpy clothes. Otherwise just stick with the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
