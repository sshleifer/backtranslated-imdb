The seven collaborations between director Joseph "von" Sternberg and the star Marlene Dietrich were so different in appearance and tone, and so different from everything else that happened, they almost seem to constitute a separate subgenre. Like any genre, they have their direct masterpieces as well as their absolute turkeys. Time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm. After the naughty seductive hits The Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, where Miss Dietrich established her screen as a cabaret singer-cum prostitute, someone at Paramount decided it was time for Marlene to play a mother. There is nothing wrong with that in itself; As an actress, she was up to that part. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. It's like The Blue Angel plus a child. True, the story of a woman pulling her baby together on her sleazy escapades is a prerequisite for a tragic drama, but that's not how it is played. Dietrich's journey is played as a kind of adventure that uses her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. This is not a bold example of pre-code libertarianism ?? It's just bizarre unpleasant. Although we may accept Marlene, is a doting mommy, there is absolutely no way to buy Sternberg as director of heat and poignancy. Despite the fact that this was one of the handful of pictures he also took on a writing credit, Sternberg simply does not fail to get the story. The film's emotional payout must be the final reunification of the family, but even at first it is not established as something worth coming back to. Sternberg's interiors are as always dressed and shot to resemble either brothels or insane asylum. Faradays' home is actually a creepy, cruel environment, and it's a wonder that little Johnny didn't bet the bed and asked to sleep with the light. <br /> <br /> But as anyone who knows them will know the point of a Dietrich / Sternberg image is to make Dietrich look fabulous, and in that respect at least Blonde Venus is a success. Marlene is introduced from a forest basin into a bright, shiny close-up, and even when she is reduced to cloths, the camera still loves her. The same cannot be said for the rest of the casting, as Sternberg used to see as mobile pieces of landscape. The usually sympathetic Herbert Marshall is here reduced to a moody lurking in the shadows. Even the sovereign and lively Cary Grant just becomes a boring, background blob and does not seem so interesting enough that Dietrich runs away. <br /> <br /> The only standout moments in Blonde Venus are Marlene's song and dance vans, especially the famous Hot Voodoo number, where she parodies her own surreal scene persona by getting out of a gorilla outfit. But even these feel as if they have been cut and inserted from another movie. Sternberg's fans can greet it as another masterpiece they usually do, but for the average punter it is a huge disappointment. The audience of the time did not clap when they had her previous hits, and it heralded the beginning of the end of Marlen's heyday. A year later there would be a new queen at Paramount ?? Mae West.
