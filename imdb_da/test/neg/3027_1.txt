Beginning is undoubtedly a person's attempt at originality, but this is art in its most morbidly grotesque form, therefore Begotten has my respect, but to be realistic it is no difference what this abomination is about, but for the post ... <br /> <br /> In the ultimate in incoherent horror, we begin at an unknown time in an unknown place. Just outside the bat, we are thrown into the psychotic nightmare that is begotten, a god is apparently depressed, mutilated with a razor, I think, really trying as hell to finish everything it takes a while (why would it Not that?) After this ultra-morbid introduction something happens, something rising from the body, saying hello to Mother Earth. What is she doing? Well, she gives birth to a thing. The case would probably have preferred to stay in the womb, but it is life. The gifted psychotic nightmare kingdom greets the case the only way it knows how. The case with Mother Earth is mutilated by unknown, hooded, attackers, with evil intentions the only clarity available. From this point on, things pull as they have never pulled before. Interesting, gloomy pictures with a completely decent soundtrack are the highest points in the rest. Not to give the impression that I do not recommend this evil because I do it but only once, and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side. From my description it may seem that I "don't get" begotten. Believe me, I get it, and yes, Begotten is art if I've ever seen it. Everything in this movie is insignificant, no matter how independent it may seem. It is perhaps the only thing that makes Begotten art. That said, most of us require some kind of entertainment value and it comes from someone who enjoys Chooper. Probably the most exciting first five minutes I've seen in a movie, but let's be realistic for the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it is meant for some kind of psychedelic purpose in that case. , never remember. But how would one judge such a dull masterpiece? Depending on how much your level of attention can take, it should be either 1 or 10, any other number will just not comment. It hurts to do this, but as far as the entertainment value goes, Begotten just isn't. 1.1
