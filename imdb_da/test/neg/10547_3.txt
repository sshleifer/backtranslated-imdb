This is the worst of the toxic series by far. The action in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them in half the time. The biggest problem with this movie is all the sudden changes from the original. Like there is another girl friend of toxie in this one or it may be the same character just with another name and the game of another chick. Why is this movie made like a Disney movie. After approx. fifteen minutes it starts to be good with gore and everything. There are 2 fantastic kills, so the film goes directly to poop. After the movies are 20 minutes up, the movie is entertaining entertainment. H * L IT'S IMPORTANT IMPORTANT. Well, unless you are drunk, don't watch this movie. YOU ARE WARNING.
