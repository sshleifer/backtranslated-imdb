Frankie Muniz plays Jason, who is a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is built on small or large lies that often put him in trouble. But he can't escape his teacher and he finishes his creative writing lessons just before the deadline. While cycling fast to deliver his homework to the teacher, he is crushed into a car. As he explains the situation to the grumpy man (Giamatti) in the car, he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car, otherwise Marty Wolf (Giamatti) says it. After a couple of months, Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that scares him. Because the story of the film is based on his homework. He tells it to his parents, but of course they don't believe him. Especially his father uses words that offend him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf denies it, Jason takes action and destroys his life. <br /> <br /> This is the short story of Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's movie it can be a light heart, but there are some mistakes that could even ask if it is possible. Such as having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to figure out the problem, accessing this cinema producer's highly-protected house and office, set up a telecommunications system overnight. Is it so credible? It does not. Well it's a kids movie, but the kids aren't that trustworthy. Big Fat Liar offers a little pleasure to his audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fat liar to say this is a good movie. ** out of *****
