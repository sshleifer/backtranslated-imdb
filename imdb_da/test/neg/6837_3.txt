It may well be the worst remake Hollywood has ever produced, and that says something. I take it beyond that and say that this movie is so amazing, badly bad that it should be seen. I do not know if I am even able to handle all the things that are wrong with it - like the fact that the casting director seems to have pulled names out of a hat, or the thinking of Richard Geres's character is allowed to go away scot-free at the end (i'm sure the folks say, "it's just fiction that cares" would have no problem if it was a former al-qaida operative who just wants to return to his homeland ) so I just want to devote my review to the complete hilarity that is essentially the scene where Bruce Willis tests his gun. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember that Jackal practices his killing on a pumpkin. Pumpkins explode on impact, an effect known as "understatement". In this version, Willis prepares a pumpkin goal, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a giant remote-controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored behind a huge eye-catching minivan (this man likes a challenge). He reveals the gun by pulling away a tepee, after which Jack Black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says "It ROCKS! This thing ROCKS!" About 18 times (I think Willis didn't have to separate it first, he just lifted it, tarp and everything out of the hill of the van, despite it probably weighing several tons). The scene then turns into an Austin Powers movie, when Willis misses pumpkin and takes a tree out, then Black runs through the mud with the pants falling down and eventually blowing Black's entire arm. The pump falls to the ground, unlucky. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this movie for a non-ironic reason, it's for the Diane Venora character as a hard Russian major who gets romantic with Gere despite having a facial disfigurement - a bold feature for a Hollywood feature. At the middle film, I really liked this character, so it was a shame when she was to be killed. I would have liked to see a movie about her. Apart from that, this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 10.3.
