In another of the horrific horror movies, I seem to be so masochistically attracted that we have a lot of friends stuck in a haunted house, slowly killing one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that sprinkled yellow blood and have very bad problems with the tooth. However, the first 45 minutes are spoken, and considering the young thespians cannot get out of a paper bag and get the most banal dialogue that has ever been insignificantly recited. This is especially painful to sit through. If you manage to stay awake through that nonsense, it will not be better .. with poor makeup galore and cheesy, cold cellar (not so special) effects. As for the conclusion .. Well, what is the bet that the old-fashioned who warned them not to go to the creepy mansion in the first place will emerge and save the day for the last two survivors (a boy and a girl of course) with its mysterious powers? Please .. life is too short for these kind of movies. Donate the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tour that helps the community, make a few shifts in a soup kitchen or something. You will feel that you have actually done something productive with your life and you will not have put money into pockets in studios that churn out irredeemable rubbish like this. Unfortunately it's already too late for me .. now where have I put that copy of 'Pumpkinhead'? 1.10
