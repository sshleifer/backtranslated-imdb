I've rated this movie a 1/10 and have done it in good nature. this movie is not as it seems and i don; Don't get points from it. Take the first joke for example. Theirs is the sign at the beginning to start. Well, that was OK, but then they start having a guy talking about the cap, and then he dies, so their other guys talking, he dies after the other guy says people aren't coming to birthday without dying. And he gets a cake now. then he dies. The jokes are just stupid, they are not so clever and I would have thought they would have been better off some like the directors of scary movies: Shawn Wayans (written by) & Marlon Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by ) <br /> <br /> But it sucked and I jump the next time they want to make another comedy, they make some good jokes, don't lame them.
