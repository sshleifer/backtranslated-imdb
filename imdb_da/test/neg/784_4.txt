Primarily. Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? Calling it a poor performance would be an insult to bad performances. It was a historically terrible achievement. Any little chance that Diaz had been a serious actress is now complete after that. Laughably horrible. <br /> <br /> Two, the movie was extremely boring, and not very thoughtful at all. I can sit and consider human nature without having to see horrible actors, playing a horrible story. Third, there was not a single sympathetic sign, and even worse, it seemed that it was made by design. You should not suffer or feel sympathy for any sign. It was quite effective. I wanted everyone to just die to be honest. Foreigners included. Kid included. Everyone was just a big mop in this movie. Everyone literally just moped around and they called it a movie. You could hardly distinguish zombie "employees" with ordinary people because they all seemed like zombies. Finally, nothing really makes sense. From the characters reactions and emotions, to the literary history line, it all just seems random. This is just a really bad movie, spoiled and pronounced as a "thinking man's movie" that is supposed to be confusing. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
