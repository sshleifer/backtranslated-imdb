I was totally saddened by this movie, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Every thing just gets so serious and people swear with really stupid expressions. Then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill a person to get the title of serial killer. The serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films; <br /> <br /> Why, why? I have no idea. It really really will be scary, but I think in this universe frightening is just like talking a whole lot and adding dark surrounding sounds. Just for the record, this is by no means a horror movie, it is definitely a thriller (barely). Real filmmakers today have to do their homework before they make "horror" movies or at least call a movie a "horror" movie. it makes me say (i can also say ironically) "Acolytes you take forever to say nothing."
