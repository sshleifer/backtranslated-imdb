(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important, you couldn't have figured out yourself) Yes, it's really weird. I rented it from a Blockbuster for the reason that it had absolutely no description of the film at the back of the box, just a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that I had a dick's time to find it, even here at IMDB. I kept confusing it with "Demon's Night", but you know they're pretty much the same. <br /> <br /> The parts I loved most about this movie were all in the garage. The black gym guy was funny as he screamed all the time. Even when screams were not really necessary, he would leave a "LIST NOW !! BLOCK THE DOOR WITH CARS !!!!" And then they would drive cars head into other cars. But then he got balls and shot by a zombie with a diet stick, I think it was. The other part that has gotten my attention a bit was the part of the crash outside the building with the boys that the girls didn't want to come over ... To what significant aspect of the movie did it give us? What was it? Why was it there? Why did the movie end with a guy who broke the TV in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was a little far away. I mean, he could just have turned off the TV. Yes, this movie was shot at a whim and yes, I hated it. Good day...
