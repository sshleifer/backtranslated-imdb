This movie is about the worst I have seen for a long time. Terence Stamp's talent is totally wasted, and almost all I enjoyed was hearing a favorite song from mine, "If I had a million dollars" of BNL in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the protagonist, a lovely guy who is roped into the house sitting for his boss. Misadventures follow. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and have nothing better to do then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, see something else. <br /> <br /> There are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. They are always pleasures to see, although this film managed to dampen even those bright spots.
