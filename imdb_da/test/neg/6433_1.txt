"War is in your blood" Rambo says early in the film, "Don't fight it". What do you say? Is the scriptwriter Mickey writing out of Sly? It is impossible for any person with a primary education to miss the joke here. Still, Stallone elaborates without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an over-the-top, idiotic act that would have been fun without intent, if it wasn't morally violent. A redneck fantasy of the basic kind, where villains are so fatal, is not enough just to kill them ?? You have to separate them with pleasure. Stallone stops at no blue collar clich√© to make his point. It's not enough that the top villain must be the feed-them-to-pigs, throwing babies on fire as a sadist. He is also gay pedophile. <br /> <br /> What happens to IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this scary excuse for gross exploitation be so high? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but it's not entertainment ?? This is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately destroys the real tragedy in Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't take off her shirt. For this I will give it a star ...
