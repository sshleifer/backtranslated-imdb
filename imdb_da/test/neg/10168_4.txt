Two years after this film was made, "The Juror" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See "Jurgen" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial by Jury", with better acting, better control and a much more poignant aura about it. William Hurt was not credible as a policeman, and Armand Assante could not be more unequaled as a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown suit. You didn't get involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be so worried about what happened to her. The way she interacted with the jury was neither convincing nor interesting in any way. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a hooker / killer was not enough and quite frankly unnecessary for the plot.
