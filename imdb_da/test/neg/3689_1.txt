There are good movies and there are bad movies, and then there is Moscow Zero, a film that is so bad that it spends a month alone with an insurance salesman an attractive entertainment alternative. <br /> <br /> With an incomprehensible plot of hell gates opening into a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a mess of repetitive and inappropriate shots of a little girl running through tunnels, red lights floating and strange wall shadows , none of which serves to mount any fear or excitement, but instead causes the reaction "here they go again with the girl (or lights)" from the viewer. <br /> <br /> Directed by María Lidón, who for reasons I can only conclude as shame, was billed as Luna, movie star Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) , a friend and colleague who has missed out on the tunnels. He listens to the help of a number of locals, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, all portrayed by Spanish actors trying to curb Russian accents with limited success. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they cross paths with members of a kind of underground leather-plated religious mafia led by a portly Val Kilmer whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he wants to appear in this kind, and hands Sage Stallone (Sly's son), who seems to have been thrown just so that the Stallone name can be included in the film's tent. <br /> <br /> Apart from watching the squad, they try to navigate through the tunnels using a comic-drawn card, and repeated images of them are followed or eluded by a pale faced young girl, not much else going on throughout . Dialogue routinely changes between English and Russian, with actors often changing in each language, and whole conversations are spoken half-way and a-half in the other with the only apparent reason they felt like it, and add a frustrating dimension to the viewer , over and over trying to figure out the crooked cobbled together story. <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that Moscow Zero gets right is the title that could only have reproduced a more precise description of this movie if the word Moscow was omitted.
