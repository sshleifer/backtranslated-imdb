<br /> <br /> This movie is so incredibly unfunny that it makes anyone who wants to cry, the clich√© put on thicker than 5 year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humor out of your heart , every joke was poorly timed and would not have been fun if it was timed properly. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, there is a real chance that you will never be able to enjoy comedies again ... ever.
