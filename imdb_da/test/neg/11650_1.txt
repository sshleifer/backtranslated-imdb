I'm sorry, but it really feels like a modern Apollo 13 knock-off. Absolutely unlikely (at least Armageddon FIELD as a cartoon! It felt like a bad High School movie project). The action was about as a cliché, which one can get, and .... landing a space shuttle on an LA motorway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who comes in everyone's ways, stalwart manager with "Go Fever". And it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or anything to make an entertaining story, but at least do it well! Facts and science were completely slaughtered for this. The shuttle does not have fuel tanks in that wing, and although it did, it could not control by switching fuel between them (and it could not be a DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism and cheesy clichés, this can't be beat!
