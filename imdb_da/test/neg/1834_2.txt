There is an endless supply of unmatched horror movies. It seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and excitement. Alas, these attempts rarely succeed. This unfortunate film has almost no redeeming value. The story is very predictable, most of the actors are very uninspired, or just miscast, special effects of very low quality. It made a lot of effort not to turn off the DVD and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films issued in the United States, why in the world would anyone like to import this drift. First, there is apparently an "Anatomy 2" for those who have nothing better to do. I'd rather see the color dry.
