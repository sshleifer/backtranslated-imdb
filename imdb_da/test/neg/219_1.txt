This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast was amazing, but the movie itself was horrible. It was so terrible that I had to register to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and I would break it every minute I saw. It could have been good. Had a great premise. If you want to steal a hooded car and there is a homeless person who sees you, do what you need to do. For the protagonist to decide to have a policeman killed and kill his friends and colleagues after the homeless guy was already dead, it's just ridiculous. And yes, I am sure there will be answers to this about how his conscious came to him, but proceed. The protagonist searched the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him. He broke money and grabbed and beat the police just behind the other guards, and no one saw him. He could get back in the armored car and no one saw him. This movie had potential but blew it. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie ever again! Never see it! Aggravated ...
