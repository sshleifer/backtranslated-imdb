Fanglys is put in a small Texan city called Layton on Halloween, as the city's people treat it like Christ's second coming or something, I mean, Halloween is not that important is it? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called to another murder when the local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) has discovered a body in the local forests. Could it be Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The key character involved in a local legend of a witch killing teenagers, who knows? Being the fun kind of guy he is Mark (asisstant director and producer Robert Harvey) convinces his miss Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to ride out to a cemetery that his friend Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before for a Halloween party. Of course, the idea of ​​staying at a cemetery in the middle of the forest appeals to Kelly & she agrees with Steven & a girl he took up with the name Camille (Natalie Woods) & their nerd friend Jerry (Tim Boswell) for one night fun as fun as you can expect to have at an isolated cemetery. But they soon discover that the legend of Fang Lady is far from bedtime history, many educate ... Edited, executive produced, written and directed by Christopher Abram Fanglys is a beautiful attempt to horror movie. The script is very predictable, boring and does not provide any kind of entertainment value in the right hands and with a decent budget. Tail light could have been an effective horror movie, but as it is, it is not. It moves at a reasonable pace, but the screen 'action' is so bad that it doesn't matter, I don't quite know what else to say other than The Fanglys is a really bad movie and I can't see anyone getting any kind of pleasure out of it. The dialogue is basic, the character is cliché and lifeless, while the movie as a whole works much longer than 90 minutes of playing time. There are a few lama attempts at humor that are not so good with the horror elements, and what was the retarder that held that cage? I could imagine that the budget did not allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry at the end, then you also keep an eye on the final credit as the lingering truth is revealed, provided you can actually do it so far of course (believe me it requires something ). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does nothing special. Abram thinks that both scenes in neon lights are stylish, I can tell him it's not when your movie is set in the woods. There is no atmosphere, scare, tension, excitement or any of the elements that make a good horror movie good. Forget about decent doing, there is little when someone eats some skin of an arm and a pitchfork stuck in the throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently, The Fanglys had a $ 2,837 movie budget, making it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release and being brutally honest shows it. What about the retarded guy and his fake joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? The horrible special effects, the camcorder and the horrible action of all involved, making it even more painful to sit through. <br /> <br /> Fanglys is straight two video crap, it has no redeeming features at all, and it's low IMDb user rating score is fully justified, it's one of those movies that I watch within half an hour on the clock and wish it would just be finished.
