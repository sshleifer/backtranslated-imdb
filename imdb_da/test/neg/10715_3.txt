Fun with Dick and Jane failed to entertain at so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems that one of the biggest conflicts was the accusation of Jim Carry's character DIck Harper, but the authors never follow up the concrete conflict. The reason is the story weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves some scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey was not particularly fun in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she was not fun It is not fun either. This is just another example of Hollywood banking off franchise actors with a miserable unoriginal story.
