An excellent cast that does their best with a terrible script, inappropriate direction, and some of the worst scores I've ever heard. More television movies a week than serious drama. It is boring when you find that the source material is very serious and very real. The film producers decided that instead of building drama and character, it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope the audience would be shocked at the sympathy and care. In my opinion, one of the most obvious forms of cutting and inserting movies is adaptation.
