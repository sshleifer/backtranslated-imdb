* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> In this wild satire, Chaplin set his views on the evil of German fascism and played twin roles of the tomanic dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an unintentional World War I and Jewish hairdresser. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighboring states Osterlich, while finding time for numerous, strange flat sets. The dictator's very famous waltz with an inflatable pad is actually quite heavy-handed, underwhelming and unfunny. <br /> <br /> Chaplin should certainly be praised for looking at lampoon Hitler and for speaking heavily on celluloid - his very malignant final speech is actually the bold, memorable highlight of the play - but the movie is simply not sharp or fun enough to deserve the rose, often stuck over it, nor require repeated views. The best gags are away from Hynkel's tedious positioning and involve The Barber, who is trying to avoid a large spider bomb (a sequence that steals from the gold rush's gunpowder) and later with a pot upside down, accidentally walking on the plank. thanks in his shop. Compared to the director's silent classics, the great dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and, in general, somewhat unsatisfactory, while the harsh stakes between laughs are often long and difficult to endure. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing images, and The Great Dictator is determined as such.
