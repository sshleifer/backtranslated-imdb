WHOLE PURPLE TORQUE <br /> <br /> Picture format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> <Two effortless nightclubs (Laurel and Hardy) cannot pay their bill and induce violent retribution from a warm-fast servant (Tiny Sandford). Typical L&H scenario, less significant than some of their best work from this period, but worth looking at. Stan takes the center in this round, caught in a financial dilemma, after he has repaid part of his salary to fund a night on the town, to find out - too late! - That his fake wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his stash with worthless coupons. Some of Laurel's long-standing close-ups as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveals his genius for characterization and mime. The 1920's morality is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, who plays a hatchet-faced busy-body who takes great pleasure in warning L & H's respective spouses (Holderness and Lyle Taho) to their husbands' bad behavior. The end fizzles, but the movie still has a lot to recommend it. Directed by James Parrott.
