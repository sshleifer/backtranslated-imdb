Roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible boyfriend and an idea for a corn dog he plans to patent and sell. Immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and get work. Then his girlfriend becomes full and cheats on him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these details of the plot are explored in any detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the movie will be. When his uncle dies, there are some boobs on the screen, one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty much fun for about 40 seconds. The finish is literally the worst I have ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life back! <br /> <br /> I didn't think anyone could make a movie with so little profit: There are certainly rules against this kind of thing coming to the public? The script cannot be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been small because the whole movie has about 3 places and a car. The only conceivable use of Roomies is, in my opinion, that you hold any hostages and will frustrate them beyond human thought. If so, have it repeat and you will have a finished gibbering wreck within the day. <br /> <br /> one and a half out of 10
