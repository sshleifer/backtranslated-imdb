Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers fascinated me so much, I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it is frustrating to see it turn up. I really feel the problem with the movie was Director and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I'm not an MM hater, I thought he was great in both Fire of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in these movies without having to see him with his shirt from 3-4 times. Yes, we all get it that he is a nice guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew it 10 years ago when he came on stage in A Time To Kill. Showing him with his shirt from pumping iron as a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is completely unnecessary. I think once would have been sufficient. It wouldn't surprise me if they threw the unnecessary scenes so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to watch a movie about sports games unless ...... Enough about it , let's get into his role. I feel that his action was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. I know his character should be this charming southern, but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost like referring days and confused lines a couple of times! In short, I didn't like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent, his shirt out, corny pick up lines, weak sales positions. His character was just too much of a tool like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that was no surprise. Piven is fun to see as Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel that this movie was very commercial and put together badly. It's insulting that they could take a good story and throw in crap ingredients to try to make it a box office success. 1. Cold story that appeals to the male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actress for female women (make sure he has many scenes with shirt without lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 great one lines 3. Each character must be dressed in a thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven plays the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development and intelligent casting is unnecessary <br /> <br /> This will be good enough for most people but not me! Anyone who disagrees with me, ask yourself this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I would probably be part of the minority by thinking of this movie sucking. I realized when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous closing scene in Pacino, who shot a fake tear while embracing Russo. The economic success of this movie will ensure one thing. The film comes publicly what the film comes to the public's wishes, big budget crapola.
