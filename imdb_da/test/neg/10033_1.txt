Thank God, I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after seeing it, they feel like being refunded! This must be one of the worse movies I've ever seen! I realize they couldn't have had much of a budget, but I swear I could make a better movie than this staring at my pets! The action was horrible, so was editing, the dialogue, everything! It was so bad it was serious to make me angry when I saw it! I look forward to the REAL movie about this story coming out soon, so people curious about it doesn't have to bend to see this joke!
