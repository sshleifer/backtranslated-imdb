Before the last conversation with Carson Daly, my local NBC branch sent much more valuable programming for Late Night w / Conan as the second city TV, 3. Rock From the Sun & Carline in town, and some stand up comedy. These days there is nothing worth looking at, because all I see is Carson Daly and his horrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he is not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> At his June 21 show, he tried to use an internet meme called "Rickroll" on his show. He failed hard. This event confirms that Carson Daly is horrible.
