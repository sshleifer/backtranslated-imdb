This movie stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this by a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE ... Although I'm ashamed, I own a copy and the studio has changed the cover to play on Sandra Bullock's on the whole. They play it up to be "A Sandra Bullock Movie". She has only a small role in the whole movie, and she does her best with it, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Now everyone should start somewhere ...
