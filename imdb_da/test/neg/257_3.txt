In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relatively unknown - an unconscious actor starred in one of his first films. And because he was unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie - a fast movie with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would still take Bogart many years and another movie studio before becoming a household name. While the film is not horrible, it is certainly not good - it makes it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today. Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. But when a beautiful rider star gets his way, his dreams all look underway. As one of the characters in the movie said, the combination of the two is oil and water - they just don't mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart throws away his promising career, his sister goes full speed on the road to Skankville - has met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for lots of money! Bogey has no idea that his sister is not the actress she claims to be, and does not know later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is .... Bogart SISTER !!! All this leads to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. But what follows is one of the stupid scenes I've seen for a very long time! Currently, the rich lady will not marry the guy who sleeps with Bogey's sister (whew!), But because she is now poor and not good at Bogart, she is about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it takes off and creeps up on the hull to take control of the plane and rescue her !!! This is so completely silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing loudly. Until then I could have scored it a 4 or 5 - this sank the movie to a 3 (how a reviewer gave this a 8 is past me). The bottom line is that this was a speaker and silly movie. On top of that, everything is wrong for Bogart, as action hero at the end and the simmer lover are terrible fights for his persona who were so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid fit the man better - one of America's great actors, but clearly out of his element here. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love Pre-Code movies and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this. Almost everyone in the movie believes in and practices pre-sex sex and Bogey curses in the movie - things you would never have seen after the hardened and moral code of production were adopted in 1934.
