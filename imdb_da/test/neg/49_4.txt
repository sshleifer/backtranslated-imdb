Scare begins with a horror movie icon kills an instructor and then his waiter before he is laid to rest. This icon, which has some Christopher Lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt them around him when a group of horror movie students steal his body from the mausoleum he is in. The first ten minutes are well-filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous chaos. But the film draws in the middle (although fortunately not as much as "House of Death") and never really gets the first spurt of energy back. Many of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just fallen over frightened when they see a floating coffin or other odd thing. Twice we see that toxic gas is being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the performance of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is the false advertisement unless he spent his career playing boring old men taking a nap and watching "Matlock". <br /> <br /> The general principle of the movie is decent: horror society children steal a body of a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a good movie. Maybe a remake is okay if it wouldn't be too disrespectful. Sometimes the theory does not come across as well in the application, and this film offers this example. The only redeeming quality of this movie (beyond the start) is the short appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought "it's Jeffrey Combs" but felt I was wrong when the box never mentioned him. But probably Combs was present. (A note to the film's filmmakers: mentions Combs on the DVD's cover, you will sell more copies if you want to deceive customers.) If you are Jeffrey Combs die-hard, check out this early role. Otherwise, I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Let me suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn" as they are both pretty decent and will stand the time test.
