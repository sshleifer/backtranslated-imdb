John Candy was a very hit-or-miss comedian. His death was a tragedy, and we all miss him a lot, but WAGONS EAST, where he plays a bumbling wagonmaster who is in favor of taking a group of pioneers out of the wild west, is even more sad. I don't understand why it was even released. The story is pointless and weak, and the jokes aren't there. It makes me even more so that Candy's last movie would be his all-time worst movie. So let's forget about this one and remember him in his better movies like vacation rentals, plans, trains and automobiles and UNCLE BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
