On the recommendation of a friend and my admiration of Philip Baker Hall, I rented Loop's first season disc. It's a typical TV comedy with all the cliches that the genre employs with the "wacky" scheming brother (Sully), "ditzy" blonde (Lizzy), the token untouched love interest (Piper), sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, reminding me Arliss as if someone should be reminded of that show). The plot is about different accidents (usually by Sully), which move Sam to endanger his work on the plane, only to make him save the day with "hilarious hijinks" in the middle. I didn't reveal a particular episode. I described them EVERYTHING to a T. Here lies the problem, which may even be an acceptable entertainment in the beginning, just becomes useless when one sees episodes in a row and grows bored without faith in the endless repetition. Sully will do something 'wacky', Mimi Rogers will say something overtly sexual, Russ will tell about his gay son, Darcy will make her imitation of Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh. But don't let it fool you into thinking it's good. Go see a much better comedy. Arrested development, always sunny in Phillidelphia, two names two from the top of my head. Surprised that this is still in the air. OH, it is true that Fox only cancels the good shows I have forgotten. Needless to say, I don't trust my friend's taste in shows anymore. <br /> <br /> My character: D +
