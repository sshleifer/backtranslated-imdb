I went to see "Quitting" with great hopes because the director's "Shower" had impressed me so. Despite a few in mawkishness, "Shower" is high on my list of all-time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally amazing play and direction. And I've seen it at least three times now. <br /> <br /> But "Quitting" fell flat, in my opinion. It seemed a pointless exercise, and I was so tired of the character's unacceptable personality that I longed for the film to end. I admit to falling asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still OK to write this comment. <br /> <br /> I admired the parents and the sisters. The device to use all the real characters in the movie is a great thing I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Disappointment aside, I'll still make the effort to watch movie material bearing Yang Zhang's name simply on the basis of the beautiful "shower".
