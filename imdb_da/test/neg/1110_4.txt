First, I'm a horror fan. But this "Tobe Hooper" production (come again, the man from the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was below standards, even for a fan. The action was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the leading ladies were OK. The story was something we have already seen a hundred times without any surprising twist or anything. Never exciting or intense, and do not expect any special effects beyond blood-spraying. The scary zombie children are white paled faces with dark eyes, and that's it. It could have worked in the early 70's, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone did not do a good job of keeping the tension halfway through the risk of falling asleep. My voice is primarily based on the leading act, but it could easily have been called Children Of The Corn 8: From Corn Fields to the Mines ... Enough said ..
