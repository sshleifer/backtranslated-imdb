When I finally came around to watch this movie recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like at first glance ... yet another Hollywood CG / live action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable at all. Designed in every way to appeal to very young children and very immature adults who make much use of comic devices such as farts, poo-eaters and the size of Theodore's buttocks. This movie will bother me much less if it wasn't such an obvious step down to the chipmunks. Even their characters I found were changed to worse for this movie. While each of them previously had a very distinct personality, they all behaved like immature, smart children with ADD who constantly jump out of the walls irregularly. It has particularly disturbed me to see Simon portrayed this way ... He should be the wise, serious nerd who acts as the "equal man" to Alvin's crazy antics. But here he is basically a carbon copy of Alvin. A joke in the film even implies that Simon only * thinks * he's smart, but it's really not ... and honestly, if I had never heard of Chipmunks before I watched this movie, I would have agreed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just another obvious cash grab and I'm more than a little sorry it was even made. That it is a "kid" movie does not apologize for its mistakes ... To apologize for a silly movie that breaks down a classic franchise just because it is for children is insulting to children and any child deserves something more intelligent than this movie .
