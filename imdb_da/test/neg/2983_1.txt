It was without a doubt the WORST movie I've ever seen, but when I started, it was like the really bad car wreck on the roadside - you can't help yourself, just look. My eyes !!! The action was horrible, the production was horrible, the movie was horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. I was glad the pastor was chopped would have loved to have done it himself because of his bad action. I think sucking works for the tenth power. I would have cheered if Chris had just fought too much of them before he hit it on himself. And what was the freaking wig from hell on his head? I sincerely hope that no one was paid, I think if one is paid, one must be considered here, they should be paid never to try another movie project, everyone involved, never again. It was just a big piece of garbage that I am embarrassed to say that I just had to keep an eye on everything at last. You shouldn't see it, it's about an hour and a half, you never come back, and then you have to spend time registering on this site so you can write a comment like I do now that you have to do as a catharsis to survive the aftermath of seeing this movie (and I use the term "movie" resolved here).
