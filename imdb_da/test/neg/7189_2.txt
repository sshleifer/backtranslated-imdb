The actors of this movie must have sat down one day and said "let's make fun of the Russians while showing people how advanced we (the Americans) are". The film portrays the Russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas of the Americans. It is true that US campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in other countries. But this film goes a long way and it exaggerates the differences between East and West. For me, it looked like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
