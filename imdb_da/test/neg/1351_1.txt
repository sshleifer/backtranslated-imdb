I really wish I had read everyone's review before I came to watch the movie. It was one of the most tireless movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater for 5 minutes in the movie; I should have followed my instinct. The film offered nothing new or wise, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to find out that it was ruled by a woman! The characters did not represent any women I know they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, bad makeup and hair styling. It was recently compared to Sex and the City movie; It wasn't even half as good. My suggestion, don't watch this movie!
