This movie is trying to say something deep; I'm just not sure what it was. Too much is left unresolved in the end for me to find out the main point. A few scenes have really wondered what was left on the cutting room floor. I don't think the wall was very well developed. I never got what actually happened there. When the mother finally reveals it, I just couldn't make any connection with the boy's silence. What was the point of the boy not talking? Was he just misleading or did he get some kind of power. What was the scene with the burned girl about? Another power that the boy has or what? I do not understand how it developed any character or moved the plot. I got bully bit, but what happened to the dog? Did the dog return or let Fido's mother go too well in some way? <br /> <br /> There were several extra plate elements that were more rat than use. As a radio talk show in the background, Iraq discusses the war. I think it should create some sort of comparison with the grief and insecurity the mother and Addison experienced, but for me it was distracting and strained. I did not buy the link much. I also found the teacher to come to Addison not to say "here" to call a little. The mother, who saw the doctor, was meaningless, how did it make the plot? Was it to show how desperate the mother was to get, or was it something about the medicine I didn't get? Was it the father who came back in the last scene, or just a guy? So did the writing on the wall work? What happened to the dog?
