I couldn't relate to this movie. I'm surprised that people promise it to be so 'realistic'. How many people in your school were victims of incest? How many created gay jocks were there? How many calm people you have never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK, you wouldn't know if theirs was. But it is really these explosive problems that many never treat. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could have been explored. But hi, where is "entertainment" in it? <br /> <br /> With regard to the girl who committed suicide - I found it to be useful. In fact, I think many people in high school at some point feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what has a person to commit suicide on another day to be ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided this girl wanted suicide to make the movie more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide makes it even more provocative. I didn't buy it as a real scenario. <br /> <br /> And the other students' problems I didn't fully deal with. Bullying is explored, but it has been done to death, we all know it goes on, and it's really a matter of solving within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft, another cliché is rolled out. It's really too many clichés. I guessed the end at the start. There was a predictable unpredictability if it made sense. You all have these signs with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought what is the meaning of this character unless she is the unsuspecting suicide victim? And probably enough. <br /> <br /> One thing I want to say, and that's the film's saving grace, is that it doesn't glamorize suicide. The suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to see. It is a powerful scene (no matter how it is constructed) and one that rejects suicide as the easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes. Not bad but certainly not groundbreaking OR worthy of a 17 minute standing ovation in Cannes ???
