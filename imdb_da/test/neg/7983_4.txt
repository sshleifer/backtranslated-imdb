There is not much about "Ruthless" that feels right, starting with the deterrent title (thanks to the scriptwriter Craig Lucas who adapted his own game, brings the title with him) and continues with casting (Mia Farrow plays wife to Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be her son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that appears to be in a snow globe, but Farrow gets an exciting dose of reality after admitting he has hired a man to kill her. She flies into the night and takes refuge with a very strange couple who will help her rebuild her life. The production design and art direction of "Reckless" is fine, but they are services made for a completely inane, often alienating manuscript. It must be a dark holiday comedy, although the cast is lost with this unfunny, occasionally offensive material. * 1/2 from ****
