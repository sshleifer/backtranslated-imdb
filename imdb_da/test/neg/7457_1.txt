This Canadian "movie" is the worst ever! Fantastic amateurish. When the evil ones rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns, and one of them says with very low voice: "We rob your ship!" She flashes and is completely shy! Very scary. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two karate hookers are 40 years old, five foot twin brothers! They are really bad actors. In fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-player. <br /> <br /> There are so many continuity errors in this cheap production that it's great. On a scene, the boys have a kind of swimsuit. In the following shot they have completely different swimwear. <br /> <br /> Terrible! One must look for any fan of bad movies. I have it on VHS. It's very rare. I cherish it.
