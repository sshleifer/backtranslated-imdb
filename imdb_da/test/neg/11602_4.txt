This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it seems that he was not yet in a consistent pattern, turning from the faithful adaptation of the classic novel in Rebecca to spying thriller in foreign correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the form of "screw ball" "pictures of the 1930s. <br/> <br /> On the other hand, Hitchcock's formal method had become more consistent, so much so that he (or at least could not) deviate It was therefore unwise for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was extremely inappropriate, and in Rebecca, it was actually nice to see Hitchcock, limited by his producer and source text, forced to reverse his technique. to heavy gothic drama, but to Mr And Mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> Let us first look at the romantic angle. love scenes in Hitchco ck movies were wild, passionate and a little dangerous ?? the "ever in love with someone you shouldn't have?" situation and he was great at portraying it. This is something that makes a much earlier movie, Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not as good, but when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light and tender touch is required, and Hitch doesn't. <br /> <br /> Second, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies could be fun ?? Lady Vanishes is probably the best example ?? but only when the jokes were sprinkled through history. The master of excitement is simply not enough of a comedian to make a movie that has fun bones. He cuts up scenes as he wanted in a thriller ?? snappy opposite angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point of view shot ?? but does not allow comic timing or focus on gags. For example, the business of Carole Lombard's dress bursting with the parable is shown to us with a few close-ups, but these are timed more like revealing some crucial plot points and no comic effect. Occasionally, Hitchcock's style coincides with the comedy ?? for example, arrangement of characters on the stage at the club, where Robert Montgomery is trying to make it look like he is with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table ?? But such moments are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Even thrown by Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength, and he's boring here. This was of course exactly where "Queen of Screwball" Carole Lombard's strength lay, and yet while she is doing well, the scenes are simply not aimed at capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be funny when he was really allowed to let go of the camera, failed to whisper things at all. Of course, none of these fine comedy actors is helped by the manuscript, which does not burst with grin at first, even though the basic story is a pretty good premise. The only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after this was Trouble with Harry, and it kind of worked because it played on his well-known excitement. But it was only when history could exist independently of humor, as the basic framework was excitement ?? as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot ?? that Hitchcock was able to do comedy well.
