I watched this movie for the first time the second day and was sad tears. I guess I was just looking for some flashback for the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad TV show religiously back in the day and it was great. It was action packed and the relationship 3 with Greer was endearing. There was none of this here. When Greer was murdered, you got the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor, who portrayed Pete, is a really good actor, but they wrote their part as if he were mentally challenged. Pete in the TV series was quiet and serious, but also had a fun side. They had this guy appearing as though he were on drugs at the time, drunk or simply ignorant. I would not recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete letdown.
