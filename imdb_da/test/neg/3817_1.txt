is it just me or have all the "horror" movies no more than titties, slapstick and an over-top villain who can't be killed. this movie had no meaning. what happened to the days a person could escape from the killer as in the hostel. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. he reminded me of a demon skin between quasimodo and leather surface. It was over the top that while victory lay there on fire, no one seemed to finish the job. and the end was the biggest disappointment of all reminiscent of the soprano's final. I agreed with fella behind me when he blurted out ... WHAT F ***! If I could give the film a negative score, I would have taken care of it.
