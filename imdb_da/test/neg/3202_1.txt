Don't see the author of this movie the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this one. Who dare they kill the UG? It was certainly not Ug, who had been almost like a brother to Charlie in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said, "You wouldn't just leave me on Earth, would you". Ug replied, "Charlie, Bounty Hunter" and said he was now one of them now. How dare the authors ignore this special bond between them and make him a bad killer killed by Charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized the movie was boring. In fact, for the first 20 minutes we get a new cast and have to wait so long until we find out again what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were waiting to see. I waited to say, "Come on, when will Charlie come up?" Angela Basset will do her best to deny that she was ever in Turkey. Moving to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. I think the authors decided that their movie should be the last and they could do what they wanted. This movie is completely out of the bargain with the first two. And it was not even possible to be written by the same people who made 3. 3 at least humor and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and medieval (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated it. I hated the fact that somebody liked it and I hated it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. I give this a start, simply because IMDb.com won't let me give it a zero.
