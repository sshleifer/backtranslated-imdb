A boring blend of puerile bets on humor with romantic relationship melodrama fails to give this faintly made movie with every taste of reality. As action opens, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters her apartment, discovering her boyfriend in flagrant delicto with her roommate, who happily tells Reno "Well, anyway you know", resulting in Renos Deciding never to get another roommate, this decision told viewers using a soon-abandoned voice-over. The story then goes on for ten months, when we find out that Reno is truly true to his words about avoiding roommates, although this seems to be asking the question because of his incitement to a living boyfriend Holly (Holly Fields) with whom he has generated civil law plans. The plot changes cards to a sleazy Hollywood strip club, where Reno's Uncle Charley, enamored by a "dancer" whom he finds highly desirable, cries over dead on top of the club after seeing the unclear charms displayed by the subject of his feelings. . Clearly, Charley had been aware of his heart's failing state because he created a videotape where his comment brought his big (and pledged) residence in Hollywood to Reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to his promise, interview applicants to two roommates as tenants, with him and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. After an inane sequence involving bizarre tenants candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly surprisingly find unsuitable to live with them in their house, the unknown to each other, each choosing a tenant of the opposite sex, with the lovers openly cooled against the choice of their partner. The beginners (Chad and Nicole) seem to have little traceability on their existence apart from strong responsiveness to a wide range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy Mars the harmonious relationship between Reno and Holly. Reno is bent on patenting and merchandising a type of sporting bag, and as he has given an engagement ring to Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial spirit is of great economic importance if he intends to advance his civil law. Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, if every action is apparently twisted, is likely to disturb Reno's future wedding intentions. The direction is lax, clearly far from fulfilling the basic needs of the players, although an improperly composed script provides a poor material that players can work with, and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat. The result is that the performance is incomprehensible, not helped by spotty editing, while the camera's way changes as abruptly and often as a fireball's tail light. The low budget and on-site film only requires a modicum of design process skills, but a larger measure of value may have been placed on the tasteless D.J. background soundtracks, generally blaring and almost always invasive. Much of the discussion has been stimulated by the film's final sequences, which apparently are not expected by a viewer based on what has come before, but in reality, these probably include the only thought-provoking parts of a bad cobbled play, and it is reasonable to Make work almost reliable, despite the shabby quality of production as a whole.
