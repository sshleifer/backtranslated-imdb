OK, I've seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror / suspense movies recently, working through various 50 package collections, and I have to say the guy had a limited selection, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but the PRC was lucky to have him. <br /> <br /> But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror movies, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next point of interest .... not with the thread -just screens and direction and budgets he worked under. That is the case here. <br /> <br /> This movie is, well, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part. "Heroine" seems to be doomed to be a pure-a-center version of Judy Garland, "the deer" is bland as white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't get a good transformation scene out of it . His make-up effects are not scary at all - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand, is everything. <br /> <br /> It's not a total waste. Zucco looks good on the camera, he chews the landscape while he manages to deliver some terribly affected and constructed sets of speeches without having to cuddle or lose power. There are some moody B & W shots here and there that don't suck completely. <br /> <br /> All in all ... this movie helped some "C" through "Z" level players paying their rent for another month, and it never drops below a certain level. See it once, if you like George Zucco, or just feel you have to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.
