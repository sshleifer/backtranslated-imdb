Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I don't know if that's because the snooty Jamie Lynn Spears is the price star of it or what, but I just know the show sucks. It's about a girl and her brother going to a boarding school. The jokes in this show are extremely boring and unfunny, and I hate every single character except Chase and Lola. Hi, the jokes on this show are so unfunny that they make Jack Black the Monty Python. This show is undoubtedly one of the worst shows on Nickelodeon, it's down with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the shame's pit and if this show was a person with no honor, it would hang out in shame. <br /> <br /> 1/10
