I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Mrs Rice's novels was my first thought "how can they make the Queen's Queen without making the Vampire Lestat first?" <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I can see how they did it. If you've read these books, imagine taking out the good parts of Vampire Lestat and turning Marcus and Marius into a sign and removing everything to do with Lestat's beginnings (wolf hunting, his violin play, The Vampire Theater and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), and then in the last 15 minutes patting in Queen Of The Damned. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important piece of Lestat's character. His inner pain of having to kill to live, he gently tries to choose killers as his victims and his love affair with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> Also important to history is that we lose "The Twins Story", which is Genesis of Ms. Rice's vampires. And while I'm sure the cannibalism was too intense to show on the screen, they could have done something closer and showed us more of ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Even worse, we have this love interest cast between Jessie and Lestat. The vampire chronicles are basically an American Yoni story. For those who do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese pornographic comics). But in Yoni, it's about homosexual relationships, told by a woman. Although I am sure many men object to the "gayness" characters, in this movie they went to the extreme extreme in the opposite way. Instead of Lestat-persecuting murderers, he looks for young female groupings. <br /> <br /> And the other mistakes in logic and history are huge. In the beginning, Lestat begins from a century-long sleep, and later Marius asks how he did it through the 1950s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is and says he slept through that period. Make yourself wondering how Lestat knows about 50's fashion and music as he slept through the same time period himself. And nothing is ever said about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think it's a great shame. Is like watching "Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie, I thought, was really bad. About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the play was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all the in-depth parts of the book were removed and left us only with a hole shell, just like Ankle, after he was sucked dry. /> <br /> If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original interview with a vampire or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this rust with a rod through the heart, garlic garlic on the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouth. At the end, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was meant to go straight to video, no theatrical release was scheduled. It's clear now why it was. It is only sad that someone as talented as she is remembered for this dog by a movie, rather than something she really could have shined. I rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.
