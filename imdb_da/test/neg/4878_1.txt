After watching this movie I wouldn't have my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted an hour and a half back in my life - it was the most amazing, horrible torture to know that I had wasted precious minutes of my life on this boy. I'm scared of life, and ever since this "movie" entered my life I have had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to suppress the memories, I'm really. . . but they make me burn things. <br /> <br />
