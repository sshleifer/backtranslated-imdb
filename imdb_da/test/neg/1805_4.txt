In this way, this film did not even compare with the novel. However, it was good to get a picture of what Congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I almost don't even suggest watching this movie, let alone other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others did not meet this book. An important part missing in the film is the MArlow's sense of how lack of government in Africa forms an early genocide. Also in the film, MArlow and his companions did not stop and got the note and the tree. Also, Kurtz's African mistress Marlow knocks out at the end of history, which has great influence in history, but was not in the book. In the short story Kurtz died on the ship, but he died in his cabin in the movie. The fiance's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words was also different. This movie is only effective if you want to visualize the story more clearly.
