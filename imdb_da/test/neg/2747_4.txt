`AfterLife 'is about a somewhat arrogant, reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds herself on her sister who has Down's syndrome. He cannot be bothered by her and will in principle just get her off her hands; He has better things to do. At one point he finds that he has to take her by car (she doesn't like flying) across the country. <br /> <br /> If it's all familiar to you, it's probably because you've seen `Rainman, 'a movie far better than its imitator,' AfterLife. "That it replicates the basic assumptions (heck, it's a few characters and even scenes too) is not the basic problem with the movie. The basic problem is that I didn't care about those characters. Brother Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a little by a womanizer, he has a boyfriend who comes and goes in history, and who learns to like Down's Syndrome sister (again, taken from `Rainman '). He is a journalist and tries to get an interview with a doctor who Facing a scandal When he ends up seeing Roberta, the sister, he doesn't have much time for her, and sometimes she leaves herself a little too long, and when she walks out, he becomes even more angry with her. say he will be a nicer, loving person at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not determined to be "normal"; she is "normal" and wants people to stop treating She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Dow n's syndrome and her performance is easily the best of the movie; Why didn't the writer explore his character any more? Well, probably because it would mean the characters would get in the way of history. When we probably already know the story anyway, the filmmakers didn't see the problem they created? <br /> <br /> For a film about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (the father is absent, I think he is dead but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little influence the movie has on the consequences of the viewer . The scenes are performed in such a standard, boring way, with such a standard predictable dialogue that I myself rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in movies, but it only works right if you worry about the characters. Here, the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I didn't really think that there was much to take care of. "Rain Man" has an emotional climax, but it moved me because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Talking about climaxes, this movie has a stink. There is sequence at the end of the movie that starts out as an incredible situation and ends in even worse territory; An unforgettable cruel trick is played on the audience. The sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being terribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the trainers. Target groups are not stupid and they know when the film is cheating. What a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> There is no scene in this movie that has the influence it should. There are a few sequences that are fun, yes, but when the characters speak to each other, I can almost see the manuscript in front of me, move predictably and uninteresting, and never hit anything that touches the mind or heart. There are the false arguments reserved specifically for the movies, where the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Why don't 'realistic' movies not understand that in reality anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can't express their feelings and they can say things that don't make sense or can't say anything at all? All the actors in this movie deserve better material. This movie is not based on facts, but I think a documentary about a family with a Down Syndrome member would be much more interesting. That way we can have had truth and emotion. For some reason, the characters in this movie believe that a feeling only means saying something loud and making an appropriate facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (out of 5)
