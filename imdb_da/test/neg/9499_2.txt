I don't know where to start. Maybe the whole idea of ​​this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing a little humorous about a kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive - the subject or David Arquette's "performance". It was like seeing a bull, having that penis cut off, even though I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers must find something about Sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (which I don't know, his TALENT AS A SINGER !!!!). His family doesn't have to revive that horror. Thank God, it was just shown on HBO and not released in theaters. Please do not see this if you have independent respect.
