Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural characters in his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) allows the strongest voice to be Helmut Berger's! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We come out of this trial by knowing less about what made the master great and more about the things you should not worry at all. The beautiful images belong to Visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews with Berger and Zeffirelli to Adam Low's little world. A must to avoid!
