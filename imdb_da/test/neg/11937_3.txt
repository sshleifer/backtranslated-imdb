I had great hopes for this movie when I saw the list and decided to watch it on TV, continuously for commercial breaks. I've seen Lee Van Cleef in many movies, but I'm afraid to have the other characters calling him Chris repeatedly, not making him a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music soundtrack tried to portray the grandeur in the original, but also failed to bring the movie up to the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this movie. I think if you haven't seen the original, it would be okay. Too many clich√©s and too little depth for the characters. I missed humanity and compassion and the three-dimensional characters in the original.
