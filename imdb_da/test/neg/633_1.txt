We all know that special effects cost money, but it seems they could have used the money they saved to write the script to get some better shots. The train is, of course, a model in most moving shots, the helicopter is, of course, computer-generated, the alien is similar to the end of Spaceballs, except that it is a decade later and Spaceball's had an excuse. <br /> <br /> Only smart things they did were blurring all the special effects, making them harder to see. <br /> <br /> Not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script, and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Please.
