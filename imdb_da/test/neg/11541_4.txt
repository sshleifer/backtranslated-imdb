I appeared as an extra and was in place as a journalist covering "The Dain Curse". My involvement was under the segments of this movie shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the 1969 film "The Molly Maguires"). I reported 'The Action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper, where I was editor in 1978-80 (the paper ended with the publication in the 1990s). I remember the excellent attention to detail in period costumes, cars, etc. The modern paved streets of Jim Thorpe were covered in gravel to imitate a 1920s rural rural town in the south. At that time, I interviewed the manufacturer and spoke briefly with the director during a set of breaches; I couldn't interview James Coburn, who was always a big disappointment to me. As a page I am shown briefly in one of the street scene in a snap-edge hat and a tweed jacket. The manufacturer asked me to "jump in" and it was a real excitement. I still have a collection of black and white stills I took of the production work for the newspaper. Today they can be interesting for film / TV historians .-- Lou Varricchio
