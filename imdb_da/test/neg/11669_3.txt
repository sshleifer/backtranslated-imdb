Even to allow my immaculate love for the first two films in the franchise and swept any kind of pre-stressed leanings that I might have for Max's character, I just can't make myself judge this cartoon waste of space on average, so close on earth, what had gone before it. <br /> <br /> Gone is the rugged, unpleasant stripe that gave the feel to the character Mad Max Rockatansky, gone is the sensational feeling of desert in an apocalyptic world and, more importantly, is the director George Miller's passion for the franchise. The dreadful score matches the movie's heart of film, it seems that decision makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make that third {and fortunately last} installment. Sure the stunts are spot on (now expected), and of course Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting what he has done before. Nevertheless, he clearly fought for fresh ideas with the action, as the Road Warrior's crowning glory of gasoline thoughts the persecution is repeated here, only he uses a train instead!. <br /> <br /> It's just a very bad show that may have seemed like an ambitious event back in the mid-1980s; But when you watch the three movies together now, Thunderdome is just like a director who loses his courageous approach, unfortunately being caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is, none of these genre snakes would have worked unequivocally with this series, anyway. I give the movie 3/10 for a really good Thunderdome battle sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at least. But this is the third time I have tried to like this movie, and as a glutton of punishment, which I am undoubtedly, I will not try again ever.
