This must be the worst Steven Segal movie I've ever seen (even worse than eco-piffs like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down Below). I start with the good points ... It has a stylish direction for a DTV movie and has wonderful scenes ... That's it! The story doesn't really go anywhere, it's just a range of well-staged pieces just as seagal, go shooting villains (body counting can easily match Tarantino at his bloodiest!). The reason is unnecessarily complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are. The actor (I use the phrase loosely) is at best mediocre, seagal is usually a constipated expression and wood plays I can take, but the other especially the British were down right awful. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why are bad after that? Is Seagal Created? <br /> <br /> WHERE DOES ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie with my local Blockbuster (once I paid), the assistant shot me and said it was the worst movie in the store I could have picked! (I wanted to beat him to my arm became numb) <br /> Anyway, I haven't seen Half Past Dead or Out for a Kill yet, and I'm not going back for more humility in my store, but they cannot be anything like this turkey <br /> <br /> The soundtrack should be young and hip - it just gave me a suede for half a dozen asprins. <br /> <br /> All in all this is Seagal on his WORST! The guy who has reached about 100 pounds and looks well past it, he's a guy who just doesn't when, when should he stop, he should retire now! and take one behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)
