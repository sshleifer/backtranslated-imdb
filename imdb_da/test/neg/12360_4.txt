The limited outlook was the only hidden grace to an otherwise opaque and boring film. The play was the limit absurd, which I blame on the manuscript and the manuscript. Nicole Eggert did not look at that part, did not trade part, and was completely convincing as a mountain guide. After seeing this, I was back with the feeling that some friends had some spare time and decided to make a movie. It must have been produced on a budget of pocket changes. The plot was at best thin and with the low caliber that worked at times, it asked the question of being asked, "Why are we doing this?". I managed to sit through the whole movie, but also asked myself, "Why?"
