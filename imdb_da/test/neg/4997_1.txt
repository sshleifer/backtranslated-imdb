Hi, I'm a fan of such bad-so-good movies, but there's nothing so bad-so good about Rise Of The Undead. It's just so bad, and that's it. No redeeming cheese, no accidental humor, nothing! - boring apocalyptic zombie ("Undead": a few people with almost no makeup) nonsense with lame-special effects (if you can call these effects), stupid plot and annoying actors. They also have the nerve to tear off and quote from other (better) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead & Night Of Comet) and managed to put me to sleep on the side. But it was Rise Of My Eyelids when the final credits rolled though. My advice: Save your money. It is not even worth renting unless you want to switch off and / or put some people in bed, then go ahead and give it a spin. You have been warned;)
