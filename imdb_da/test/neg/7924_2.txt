This movie is ... horrible and wonderful at the same time. I saw it only when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great nostalgic value to me. In this movie, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (playing Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing the pastor), who have big movie pictures, and these are the only performances that are okay. The rest of the play and the movie itself have all the B movie features that some of us appreciate. <br /> <br /> I recently spent 2 years trying to get a copy of this movie and it's almost non-existent. I suppose it was interrupted very shortly after the release. But I finally found a copy and paid a nice ear to acquire it. If you happen to come over the doomsday in a video store (unmistakably with a cheesy green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still have a working copy. One must look for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.
