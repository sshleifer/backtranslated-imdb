Posted by, directed by and starring champ of camp Bruce Campbell. It's easy to tell this a budget on a shoestring affair; Filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can say for sure is that the silly is not always fun. Campbell plays a wealthy American businessman with a cheating wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a business transaction before being murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is 'further' with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; Cabbie is killed in the same place. A crazy scientist (Stacy Keach) continues with an experiment that puts cabbies brain inside the American's head. With massive seams on the forehead, Campbell breaks free and strikes on the streets looking for his wife; He always argues with a strange voice inside his over-painted head. Campbell fights his rubber-covered face and makes silly expressions as he argues with himself. Bruce does what he does best, and no doubt his many fans will be happy. I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. Rounding the cast is Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Beware of the Sci-Fi channel.
