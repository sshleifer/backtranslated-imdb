The original airport (1970) was a classic of its kind and the first two B-movie follow-ups (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were at best fun, at best entertaining camp; But this crass and endless end-note lacks any entertainment value and shows a shocking contempt for its audience. It is unbearable and not even good for laughs. <br /> <br /> All three "Airports" followers were theatrical releases made by Universal's TV wing, but this is below even the modest standards of a television movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting. , visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "comedy". The project was clearly judged by the "creative" effort of Universal Executive Jennings Lang, who personally produced and received a "story" credit. <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) may have provided an element of self-burlesque as it was the previous films (especially the infamous airport 1975), but nothing is worth falsifying in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even comedy! left this raw untouched. What makes Concorde: Airport '79 special offensive is its abusive abuse of professionals. The worst victim is the highly gifted Cicily Tyson (Sounder, Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), relentlessly reduced to a swelling subplot, involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. <br /> <br /> A special kick for the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true leader, even though he is buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actor to be seen in all four films had Kennedy more than earned the main role, and his turn in the captain's seat would have been the only possible cause for this entry except for squeezing a last buck. Kennedy provides the only warm and genuine humor in this mechanical muckup that briefly puts bravura machismo and reveals a true sweet and tender side to itself and his lovable and heroic character "Joe Patroni". Unfortunately, we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and over-hiked Kennedy is, and overcoming pretty-boy Alain Delon mercilessly calls him "Porky Pig" as part of a buddy bonding that falls completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only human part of this airshow, just proves to be a set-up for a hate joke at Patronis, Kennedy's and viewers' expense.
