"I haven't laughed hard since granny got caught in wringer," says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all the Val Lewton and George A. Romero, who have gone dead movies we've come to love, depending on your personal taste, over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young actor couple plays a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after a gruesome night they visit a cemetery island. Their artistic director, Alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by performing a highly stylized ritual. Too much screen time is wrong; The Amateur Dialogue contains lame witticisms, melodramas and other forms of unnecessary filler comments (And Alan can't stop that annoying laugh ... too much!). Once the action has come in (which comes close to the end of this movie), it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I watched this on a local television program that was late at night, running a lot of movies like this ... only one scared me at age 13 ... but then again, You can laugh through it until the bitter end ... ... which is probably the reason today, why very few people still carry striped hip-huggers.
