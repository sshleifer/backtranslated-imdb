Jefferey Dahmer was a sick guy. There is not much to say about him who has not already been said, except that the many documentaries and films made about him are probably better than this one. It's Ridiculously Cheesy. It's so cheesy, a guy who wrote the whole movie on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Carl Crew (who is he?) Stars like serial killer Jeffrey dahmer, who kills spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends, a final in 1991 with a man he wanted to have sex with and eat. <br /> <br /> I didn't disturb seeing the whole movie. It is basically a documentary showing all the attacks that Dahmer took before he was caught. And since this film was made in 1993, a year before dahmer was bludgeoned to the death of a conqueror, the death of the dahmer is not shown. but it was just as cheesy as this cheese party. <br /> <br /> 1/10
