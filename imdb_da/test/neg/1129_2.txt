Of course with this movie going straight to the DVD, I didn't expect much, but this movie is so unfunny it's incredible. The only part of the movie that you can actually find extremely funny is before they even reach the island where Eddie's son is blown out of the bathroom with a jet of water, and that's it! Why do they bother at all? The first Christmas holiday with Chevy Chase was brilliant and fun. This is not. They rely on jokes about a dog with flatulence and a character called Uncle Nick, who is about 80, and is still trying to recover with beautiful women. As they approach the island on the boat, the island looks just as fake in the background and Randy Quaid, although fun in the previous movie, just exaggerates and seems to be trying too hard to be fun. You've been warned!
