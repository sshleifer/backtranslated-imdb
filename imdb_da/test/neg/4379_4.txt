For a Norris movie, it's pretty pretty. For an action movie, it is a bit boring, and in terms of predictability, my friend and I go almost every turn in this movie negles. It was nice that the killer every movement was not telegraphed by the clich√©'s 80 action movie, but came back, the only unpredictable movement tolerated the plot and the setting of the editing. Essentially, it is said quite early that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little-known actors) only kills women. No, he suddenly stops his M.O. and killing men, huh? I think it can be interpreted and rationalized in a way, but why is the movie edited to show that he will kill women ?? <br /> <br /> Once again I am sure there is a reason (ie to create excitement), but why spend time watching it when many other tension films are far better. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Renegade" can enjoy Branscombe Richmond's little como as Victor, but his short appearance can't save the movie and even a voice of 4 seems generous. <br /> <br />
