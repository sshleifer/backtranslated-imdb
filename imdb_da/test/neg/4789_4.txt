I agree with the comments on downward spin. The last views have been a little better, but of course the authors need a little more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, although they sometimes spin in "white waste" things a little too much. Subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like "Office". I think the target audience is a bit alike, as they are both the same night and lineup. One would think that Karma and the whole Eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows, but they only scratch the surface of the subject. In my opinion, it shows contempt many people have in Hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more intoxicating content. It has been proven before in many other shows.
