Oh Gawd. I would like to travel back to Monogram Studios and gasp someone in their 2 bedroom front office for this sloppy musical. It is a watt over the flat liner in 60 of its 61 minutes and actually shows (for one minute of minute spread in the second-second blower per hour) that there is a real life-rate that is poorly photographed. I just don't see the point of going into some trouble actually making this movie that could easily be energetic and actually fun and allow dullness to be the most important thing about viewing. The strange story shows beautiful vaudeville trouper Grace Hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat bag son is rich college clown. She has to make her playboy ways no matter what. Real life son (weird) Peter Hays plays his acting son. His real wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suppose this speech package was almost raison d'etre for monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire Sam Katzman. As with other monogram musicals, it just seems a reason to film the latest new furniture purchases and light fixtures to showcase to other studies that Monogram Pictures are "lavish" in their B ways. Have a horrible look at SWING PARADE OF 1946 for true proof of this: they just built this gigantic nightclub set, then found an excuse for movie actors and musicians running over it. History? None. Anyway ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? Probably standing at the PRC gateway Pictures wondering if it was safe to come in there. Junior jive hepster Roland Dupree jumps to life to rappety hitting his teen legs around two wobbly dance tracks, especially in the "big show" final set in the new and expanded malt shop / club set. The usual curly curtains hang loosely on the back wall, and the scene's set of mis-matched drapery even has a dark headgear that is pushed back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. The maids and their very common partners in this finale just look like Monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) to morning movies. They have absolutely no dance talent and are so common on the screen ... ALL the girls look like they're all called Joyce. There is even a costume accident where they have frilly hot pants ... on only one leg. It's all so terrible and crummy ... and actually annoying when one more tweak up of all concerned would result in the ZIS is actually fun. The one curiously interesting thing is the dialogue between Grace and her son / daughter-in-law: it is so randomly delivered that it actually works despite script and logic. She has a lot of life as a presence, which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be a bit convincing. The Dupree child is the right star. He can actually do something ... despite the fact that it looks like a tubby Liberace tap dance teen ... You read it right.
