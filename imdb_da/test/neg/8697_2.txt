This movie could have had a lot of potential. Determined by today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects alone, of course, action is needed. This movie was missing both! <br /> <br /> Let me first say to those who are disturbed by this, do not follow the Bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? If you want to know about the history of Moses, read the Bible. I've seen very few movies that follow a true story facts. Watch movies from their artistic quailities. <br /> <br /> In view of this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. It fails. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You can't see this here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare, stand alone, this movie hurriedly rushed. Parts where a scene needs to be developed do not. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: jump this and see the other. As a campy like the other, it is by far the best movie.
