KK should stick to singing - this whole movie was a great drill. I can't understand the boys' evil and the romance between Miles and KK. The sex scenes were also uninspired. The ending was horrible - unsolved - there must be reason to murder. And the whole boy's voyeurism was strange ..... the mother always fought with the boy - don't you think he would get any more freudian with her? And why didn't someone teach KK how to talk to bend instead of monotone? <br /> <br /> Glad I paid only $ 1.00 to rent this. <br /> <br />
