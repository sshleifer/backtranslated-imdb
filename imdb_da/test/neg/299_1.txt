"Hoods" do not deliver the goods. This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a star play, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, and Seymour Cassel, along with a number of faces known to those watching crime, but it is really a misfire if who ever was one. Writer & director Mark Malone, who is known for writing "Dead of Winter" for "Bonnie & Clyde" director Arthur Penn, has written a pedestrian potters who have a scary but asserted mob boss, Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) who sent his son Angelo Joe Mantegna of the "House of Games" to slam Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob that is fire-bombed, one of the pop's stores (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants repayment. The problem is, nobody has a clue who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comedy, such a complication can be entertaining, but here is just plain flat. Angelo and a carload of wiseguys, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence") spend half the time trying to figure out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to perform here, so they track a crazy mob hitman Charlie (Joe Pantoliano of "Bad Boys") to do the dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to get the frame, they must find him, and Charlie's relative wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly of "Bound") reveals that he is unlocked in a mental hospital. Our misfit heroes cross out to mental hospital and break Charlie out. Ca. Half of the film is over before they discover that Carmine is a child in short pants (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless. In fact, Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our brainless flock heals wheels away from his house with him in the back seat to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to ice the urchin, but he can't. Instead, he connects with his emotions and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the baby gets his paws on the gun and arrives at several speechless rounds. Angelo and he are fighting over the automatic. The gun slides out of their collective hands and hits the ground, goes out and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Now keep in mind that Rudy would never shoot the baby in the first place and Angelo and he argued about the wrong shot. So Rudy wins the ground with a fatal wound while Angelo is struggling to stop the bleeding. Talk about a boring scene of death. Angelo is in conflict with himself because his father ordered the battle, and Angelo fears that his father will make him do so if he does not execute orders. There is a flashback part plot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that gives an insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun. There is nothing far-reaching about this depressing comedy with a downer of an end. Things get worse, and if you keep through this 90 minute fog, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is pretty much laugh-less. Good actors flew in outlined roles that aren't even fun. Perhaps director Malone tried to make another comedy like "The Gang That Could Not Shoot Right." If he was, he missed a mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and spin through a few scenes with Mantegna, but she doesn't do much of anything else. She is the stereotypical blunt that doesn't even get naked. A pay slip is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this image is pathetic from start to finish. I had originally hoped that this could be a "Ransom of Red Chief" knockoff, where the child is driving wiseguys nuts, but not as lucky here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but it's not the kind of surprise that makes you look it up to its decision. <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie on a Canadian DVD sticker ?? Seville ?? And it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give away the plot, don't see the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped produce this fork. It is neither fun nor dramatic. There are no noticeable lines and none of the signs stand out as either interesting or sympathetic. The Sevilla DVD presents the movie in full frame without subtitles or closed captions.
