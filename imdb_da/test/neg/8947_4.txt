Great plays, great production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the script starts with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the other half. We are clear about character and motivation for the first half, but then the second half goes on many questions unanswered. <br /> <br /> Conflicts are convincing, but follow-up is weak. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is a war war, but we do not know whether the philosophical attitude changes through the course of the film. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of picture that makes me want to look up facts in history books. I don't feel that I can trust the movie to get a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The depiction of the war itself is heartbreaking exactly, though the woman's lack of enthusiasm does not reflect the war hysteria that celebrated Britain at that time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; Like so much in this movie, I simply don't know.
