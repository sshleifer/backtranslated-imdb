Never before has such a great casting of ugly people gathered to make an equally nasty movie. Something big and horrific is loose in the waters off the Florida coast, something that leaves half chewed up the bodies behind in its wake. Pristine island-hung Bob thinks he has caught Thingens "evil voice" on tape. Bob's assistant, the incredibly unpleasant and painfully thin Stella, decides to get help from slimy ladies man Peter, an electrician whose equipment might help them find the mysterious creature. But anyone who sticks their nose too far into the mystery is killed, killed by a baboon who is facing a hit man with a bad perm. What is the horrible secret of Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Ugly researchers have confused issues, inappropriate policemen and doctors puzzles over the increasing number of corpses, Stella and Peter do on the beach, and signs we don't care about are killed or met. Sea killer, a weird combination of an octopus, a shark and a few large dentures, never seems as threatening as it should. The association behind the creation of the monster makes no sense whatsoever. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic, and those who may be killed immediately. This is a bad shot, badly called, plot less mess. The whole thing is so scuzzy and smelly it made me yearn for a hot bath. I've had sushi plates scarier than this movie. Avoid it unless it's the MST3K version.
