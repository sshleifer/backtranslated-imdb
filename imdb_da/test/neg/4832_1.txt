This is a cellular rip-off. <br /> <br /> Bad cast ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... Bad Music ... <br /> <br /> And the list goes on ... <br /> < Well, there was no direction since history, scenes and setting were lifted straight out of other movies. <br /> <br /> Even the fighting sequence is copied. One with mace was from Kill Bill and another with fire hose was either from a Jet Li or Jackie Chans movie (I can't remember the name of this movie) ... Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the right thing ... <br /> <br /> Can't expect something original from any of the Bhatts more !!!
