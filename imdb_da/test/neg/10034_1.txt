I watched this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Poor scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by various authors and also listened to a version on audiobook. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the missing elements it should have contained. The experience of seeing this was like The Blair Witch visiting Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bedside pan and they actually show the contents of it. The witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was ugly and very strange. I really can't understand why anyone would think it would be entertaining. It shows another scene where Dr. Mize arrives, and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress on the stairs in their house in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of the mother leading her out, it's the brother. How sick? The little boy in the first scene in the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of waste, speaks for toilet paper and goes out into the house and makes these disease-like faces happy with sound effects. I think they should have left everything out. The makeup of the court James Johnston as an elderly man didn't make you really good that he was older. It made you think he was dipped in butter. The blood of Joshua Gardner as he falls from the ladder is even worse. The John Bell death scene looks as if they came out of the flour and tried to do something about it to make him look like a seriously ill man. For me, to a very pathogenic comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people was the fall of this image. These people would do better if they film advertising for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good topic and could not produce it properly. I rate this movie Capital F minus.
