Let's sum up how stupid this movie is with two details: Arnold to the Antichrist: "Let's see who's best," said with a straight face. And you can tell they didn't try to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight the evil of all evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed water, a crucified, a priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even satan expected them to be so clever. After an engaging beginning (which reminds you of the devil's lawyer) it goes nowhere. Someone gets me back the two hours of my life. You should never see it, rent it, not to buy it. <br /> <br />
