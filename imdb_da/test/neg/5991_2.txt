Sometimes Full Moon does entertaining movies. This is not one of them. Full Moon is like a low-lying Troma. Their movies are not as violent or out of the wall, but they are usually without talent. The action in this movie is not horrible, but the manuscript is pretty bad, and generally it is rather boring, and it does not even contain any nudity (like many Full Moon movies) to redeem it. Skip this one and hire the "Family Manager".
