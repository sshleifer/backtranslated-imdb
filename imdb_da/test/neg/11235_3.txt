So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy at a hotel, Marion thinks it's her far lost brother Brian, but when she approaches him, he seems to be another one with the same face. Marion manages to get her fingerprints and takes it to the police, and when the identity is confirmed, it was actually her brother Brian, she and Bob, leaving New York after tracking his whereabouts. They address Brian, but still he does not know what they are talking about, but all the couple will really know where Brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son Joey ... and even when they see Joey do not know them either. The reason thickens, and they find themselves one day and think that they are others too. Experimenting exclusively on people to make the perfect snipers even the question of why they would bother Bob and Marion in the same building as each other, behind me. Personally Gregory Harrison played his 2 parts well, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other actors they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, little excitement yes, but that's it.
