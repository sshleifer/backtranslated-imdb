Your time and brain will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's war. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the most pleasant character in the movie, Gust, the Greek, and he plays him as eunuch. Gust, in the book is hard core and completely free to speak his mind. In the film he is not even shown as important to Charlie. And poor Charlie has never been shown to donate blood (as he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the movie is too boring, and the story is too old for our modern times. We are really not worried about the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which occurred despite Reagan, not as a result) of a well-funded group of people who were extremely willing to fight. Not quite the lesson we need to hear and see how well the war in Iraq and Afghanistan goes. (As I read the book, I kept getting it, deja vu feeling, unless it was contemporary).
