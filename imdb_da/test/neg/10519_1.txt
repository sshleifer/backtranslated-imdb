What can you say about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not so much. With the average indie-style film production, this movie has the timing wrong. Editing is just awful. As for the gangster story, it could have been pulled if the gangsters were not missing character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some kind of battle line. None of them were fun. The usual suspects in this movie are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father who wants his son to make his business legit, the best friend with "zany" one-liners. But the main character, the gangster who likes to dress up as a girl. Only his motivation to dress up as a girl is that he was hit by a woman? Strange. The end of the film had to be nail in the coffin. It was mildest to antique climatic. I think I understand how indie filmmakers haven't got a real shot out, but they might as well have used pistols. Overall, I would say the hype leading up to it (red carpet premiere in Vancouver), it was a disappointment.
