I've seen most of John Waters' movies. In fact, with the exception of several of his very early ones that are not available, I have actually seen almost all of them so it's obvious I'm a big fan, and I'm sure I have a high tolerance for the brutal and irreverent in his movie. While I was over the supreme and obnoxious, I offered FEMAL FAILURE and POLYESTER - two monumental tribute to bad taste and surplus that is seriously funny movies. So I'm definitely not naughty and can take most of what Waters has to offer. But in PINK FLAMINGOS he has made a film that is so offensive, so unfunny and so offensive that I couldn't even keep it. In his other films he made before he became more mainstream, they were funny. But here is humor just not there, as it seems the intention is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way. I am glad that after making this movie, Waters sense of humor improved as divine consuming dog act (as in this movie) is shocking but not least entertaining. My advice is to skip this movie and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better movies from the 70s and 80s.
