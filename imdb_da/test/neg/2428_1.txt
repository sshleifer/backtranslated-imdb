Terrible, horrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was fun, charming and had a heart ... this piece of junk doesn't have any of those things. <br /> <br /> Recycled jokes from the original movie, stupid plots, bad animation, different voices (except for Kronk and Yzma) that don't sound like those in the original (especially Pacha ... * shudder *). <br /> <br /> The characters are off, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around. <br /> <br /> And why is Kuzco a jerk again? I thought he had reformed ... but since when are these TV spin offs loyal to the original * scrolling eyes *. I'm sorry, but nothing is redeemed about this ... at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
