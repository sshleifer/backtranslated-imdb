This film is broadly admonished as a copy of the Will Smith feature Hitch. That movie was boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as boring as unbearable. Govinda looks far past his prime. He does not have at best roles in this way. It is also convincing as his performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is by his present "best". And it's in the few scenes where he remembers putting on clothes. It could only have been through nepotism that this eye's tenderness could be stored from the rubbish bin of the film's cutting floor. Another case of Bollywood that scares itself with the shameless cloning. Another case of Bollywood audience majority embarrassment by making this a hit.
