Based on the excellent novel, Watchers by Dean Koontz, this is extremely horrible movie that probably should not be seen by anyone. Not since "The Running Man" I have seen a book slaughtered so far outside recognition. The difference, however, is that the "The Running Man" movie was still fun as an entertaining action movie laid down a million catch phrases. This movie ?? No, no distant entertainment. In fact, if you love the book as I do, you will hate this masturbation even more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINING SPOILERS ** Right, I basically have to tell you the story here, almost everything. Why? Because you, dear reader, do not have to suffer through this abomination? It's okay for me because I enjoy watching the crap. Because I like to complain about sh * tty stuff. Now on the unpleasant: This movie is about a boy and his mother runs away from the government and a mutant monkey creature who fled from a devastated government genetics laboratory with a super-smart golden retriever as the "hero" calls "Furface" . Groan?? Trust me, in history this story rocked. I'll come to that later. Still, the hero is no one else the dreamy boy-child Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not talking. Our hero runs around, sparkling voice and everyone, trying to convince his mother to help save this dog from the "evil government" who gave birth to him and made him genetically ultra-smart. The monkey creature, who is lost as an "oxcom" (God helps us), is also a genetic stew of a being built to be the ultimate struggle on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers, always playing a badass) is also in this movie, and no, I couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him, that would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting dog and creature. Oh yes here are some spoilers: He is also a creation from the government and the same laboratory, laughing and watching, spending most of the movie being a dot and killing people, and all that has to be killed must be done by the monkey - Soldier. Instead of a rockin 'kick-ass, scary horror movie, we have a rectal bleeding of a teenybopper horror flick. The dog's intelligence is discovered too conveniently and thought easier than we think we can see clouds by looking outside. Distribution !! <br /> <br /> Switch from book to movie: <br /> <br /> - Read character (Travis) turned from man to boy. <br /> <br /> - Human love interest in book (Nora) is now his mother ?? And all her depth and character growth is completely gone. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson, black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This means that the character's strength is based on his legacy in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between two authority figures is completely ignored, Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend. <br /> <br> A principle character in the book is now completely absent, the "immortal" who chased the heroes - perhaps it should be Ironside, but why is he another? <br /> <br /> - Never receive a deserved name for "Einstein" in the movie. No part of the book took place in a high school, at least not something that was of great importance to the plot. br /> <br /> - takes place over a few days, rather months as the book istisk istisk unrealistic pacing. <br /> <br /> - Korea haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - The character of Lem Johnson is no longer cool; Instead, he is a total asshole who bullies his way through people. - Hero Travis was part of the Delta Force (military segment specialized in hunting terrorists), instead his father, never seen in movies, was part of this group. <br /> <br /> - Experienced intelligence in the monster is now completely absent. <br /> <br /> - Subplotters involving Soviets and The Mob completely out of the story. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most unpleasant changes and I can remember out of hand (and one day later). <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - After 90 mute minutes of pain and mental anxiety, the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt it, it didn't help: <br /> <br /> - Michael Ironside? Usually I like him. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still quite sympathetic. <br /> <br /> - Wacky "hero 80's" title screen. <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Okay, writing for one is extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so half-assured that anyone who sees the movie will feel superior to everyo ne's involved in it. <br /> <br /> - The action is crazy and weak, especially from Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - Loose, weak, water history. <br /> - The monster just looks pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody stuff. The head is gigantic too big, the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the case in the book are seen no more than two seconds. Instead of a lean, powerful, fast, intelligent killer we have some jackass in a puke-grim monkey package that is forced on us. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no sign development. <br /> <br /> - Even the violence and the gore are done badly, for f * ck cases this must be a HORROR movie !! Usually, the violence has at least been good! <br /> <br /> The ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz exclaimed his brilliant novel to become this filthy f * cking piece sh * I am dangerously close to vomiting over me myself and everyone near me. There are movies worse than this (headache causing the idea may seem), but so far only "Alien vs. Predator", at least for me, is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: Look at the final credits starting. <br /> <br /> Works: 3/10 History: 4/10 (the story was really good, it's just awful) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 Special effects / Makeup: 4 / 10 Emergency / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> I would recommend no one sees this movie ever, except for a few extreme die-hard horror fans ?? and only if you haven't read the novel. Instead, I recommend that everyone interested in this avoid it completely and buy / check / loan the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
