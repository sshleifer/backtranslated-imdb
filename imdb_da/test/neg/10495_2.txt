I give this movie Vampire Assassins a "2" rating primarily because it did not have sex or nudity. Apart from that, I'm not sure why it was ever done. It was more like a training exercise in how to make a movie with a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovakia were the best actors. They were closely followed by "biker-dude" with the Pleather pants and the silver belt. He was also okay. Most of the film was filmed in some sort of distribution store. If you're tired of watching boxing kung-fu kicks, check out the Scott tissue, Windex and other cleaning packages. You want a lot of time to do this, trust me. I almost started making a list. The dialogue and kung-fu stunts were extremely slow. They talked slowly, struggled slowly, etc. I don't know why. At least with the slow delivery of the actors' lines, you could hear everything very clearly. I try hard to find good things to say about this movie. We saw it in the end to see if it was better, but it didn't. We could never decide if the actors really knew martial arts or were just appearances they knew martial arts. You can see yourself and decide. My favorite line was something like (vampire speaking :) "What are you watching?" Second man responds: "Your bad dental care."
