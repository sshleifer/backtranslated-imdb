What is it about drug abuse that draws first-time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject? This topic has been made to death. Drug abuse is bad. We'll get it. Drug abuse is painful to see. We also get that. But the grim issue does not allow the filmmaker to make a sloppy film. Every movie doesn't have to be the Hitchcockian masterpiece with movie quality, or use the Orson Wellesian deep focus, but it's still a narrative movie. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white and black blacks, and this movie maker is just lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting: the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy filmography. And even documentaries have a good mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but of course the director overall her and sucked her whole life out of her performance. Abusers can live in fog, but they still have feelings, but none of these signs seem to exist outside the screen. The supporting players only provided their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so hard, Debra, but some things are true if they want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie will get better - but please, not another drug film. :)
