Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the 1970s, seen in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA can be the worst Pam Grier movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; They are two female prisoners who fled the prison after Kar's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy car. The chain to each other becomes the movie THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three separate plots: A fat criminal (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) looking for the two girls; and Kar's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The movie eventually becomes so incomplete and effortless with the two women that the title should have been People. Grier, an action star, has no chance of participating in any of the many (overreacted) action scenes. Markov is excellent as Karen and Grier are OK as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. An interesting scene has bounty hunts forcing a police officer and his boss to drop their pants so he can shoot it with the smallest penis (convicted by his whore) but is easily forgotten in the midst of all the chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts well as a women-in-prison movie complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, so changes to a chase movie. If director Eddie Romero (famous for managing Filipino horror movies) was just stuck with the WIP theme, he would have been fine. Instead, BMWM gets really old really fast, and the surprise just ends that the audience is wondering why they got through a 90-minute movie so that it would end this way! Another problem: where should the movie be specified? While some of the accents are Latin American and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles etc.), all native people are of course Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for die-hard Grier fans, who are even disappointed.
