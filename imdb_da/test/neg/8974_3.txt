Having a little idle time before going to work, I watched my "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" DVD collection and chose the most unclear title in the package: Zis Boom Bah starring in a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is, of course, the operative word here, since most titles I have never heard of and I suppose they are all public. Yet stars this movie also his son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (which I just found out is a New Orleans native to the state I live in Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as the malt shop proprietor and Huntz Hall, taking a break from East Side Kids, like Peter's mate. The reason for a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible with him unaware of who she is is for the birds and does not have many fun scenes, although I liked Peter's celebrity celebrations and his dance with the Hall in a row . And the songs and dancers are entertaining in themselves. Ruby, however, is everywhere with his confusion of the American language of the times and almost everything about him makes no sense at all (though I liked his fun dance). As this was only 61 minutes, which I definitely play on the lower half of the dual feature, I will be charitable and give this one 3 for the few entertaining bits that I mentioned to enjoy.
