The beginning voice over sounds like 'The Wind' could be quite a thrilling movie, but when the story unfolded I knew it was downhill from there. The big things about this movie that blew were the terribly bad plays that all the protagonists did (except for a few scenes involving Mic's inner turmoil), there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no meaning of the plot - What were the authors thinking? Michael Mongillo won 2 'horror / sci fi' awards for 'The Wind'. HUH? What was so scary about this movie? NOTHING! Apart from the resident evil 2 video shots, the rest were more of 'made for tv thriller' - it wouldn't even have to be edited. If you want a much better movie about "murder among friends" rent "Shallow Grave" instead. <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
