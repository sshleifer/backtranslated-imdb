The female cast of this movie is amazing: you have Linda Blair (maturing nicely), Julie Strain (who doesn't get too many talking lines - that's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as a evil possessed girl), Toni Napoli and the most beautiful of them all IMO, the simply amazing Kristina Ducati (how the godly male leader, Larry Poindexter, deserved to be sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery). But besides the opportunity to see these beautiful and in some cases talented women, the film has a little to offer. The reason is uneven and does not go through the last 15 minutes or so; And when Wynorski finally manages to create excitement, a ridiculous "twist" end comes and destroys everything. (* 1/2)
