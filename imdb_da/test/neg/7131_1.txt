It was a waste of $ 9. The movie was horrible. All the "scary" parts were pointless and unfortunately repetitive. Apparently, all the tense parts could be completely predicted and did not seem to hold any of the audience's attention. The plot line did not always highlight the whole movie, and it was just a big setup for grudge 3. As it seemed that the movie was making a big plot progress, it just turned out to be a pointless scene. these instructors must follow Hitchcock's example: each scene has a point. Porbably 90% of the scenes in this movie could have been left out without any change to the plot. Final Opinion: Don't waste your time, energy or money !!!
