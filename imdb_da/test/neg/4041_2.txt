It is tempting to see this movie as a bold avant-garde experiment. I think the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely, completely, completely unfunny. The answer, judging by "From Venus", is a resounding 'yes'. This may not be the worst movie I have ever seen, but my brain seems to have suppressed all the others. This awful flip floats right on the border: badly enough, the thought still gives pain, but not so bad that my internal censors have wiped it out of my consciousness. It is hard for me to imagine what the director and cast thought they did when they did, or why they went ahead and released it when they had done it. I doubt that everyone involved in it earned a lot, but surely between them they could have accumulated enough money to buy all those prints and make them burn. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has nothing to recommend it. It's not even very bad. It's just a non-film where nothing interesting happens. I seriously thought about taking it back and claiming my money back, which is not something I have ever done before. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about renting (much less to buy!) this horrible non-movie!
