"The Apartment Complex" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created instead of a real story that tells a young psychic student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and gets involved in a murder mystery ... about If you can call it that. This low cal clock contains no excitement, no excitement, no drama, no action, precious few fun moments, a touch of nudity and almost no romance. The "condominium" is adaptable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy sofa potatoes.
