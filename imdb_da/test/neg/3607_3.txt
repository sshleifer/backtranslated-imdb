... but of course I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Now I never expected to like the first movie. I'm not sure what happens to Disney's marketing group, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated movie ends up turning me off as childish, or stupid or stupid, and yet the movies are in themselves even anything but. And no movie looked worse for me in trailers than The Emperor's New Groove, why I was quite surprised that I actually found myself totally enjoying that movie when I finally knocked it down and saw it. I came up with zero expectations and came out during pleasant entertainment. <br /> <br /> Despite Disney's track record with direct-to-video sequels, I nevertheless hoped for a better experience with Kronk here ... but ultimately I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that I felt that way). There is almost no humor aimed at adults. The original songs are uninspired and sickly sweet. The animation, though not bad, still doesn't come close to the emperor (there was no Lion King at first). <br /> <br /> The main plot, as such, is astonishingly "smaller" and consists mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact, it was the same as a series of pilot episodes for a Saturday morning cartoon series than a well-thought-out single entity . <br /> <br /> David Spade gets about four lines across the entire movie and there's not so much John Goodman, so we're back everywhere with too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - entertaining as a secondary character in the first film, but is completely inappropriate as the main lead here. Although the kids might find it a bit funny, the only thing that Kronk's New Groove did for me is to make me go back and see the much better original.
