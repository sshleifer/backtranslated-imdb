Do you hear that sound? That is the sound of H.G. Wells, who rolls over in his grave, between this version and Spielberg's film abortion, has been a hard year for the classic novel. But at least Steven got a few things right in relation to this crapperella. Hey, the ships weren't big insects they had names. They were tripods and foreigners worked for three years. The ships and foreigners were wrong, you really didn't see foreigners to the end. The effects and the casting work fine. But these actors are much better as this "movie" deserves. The mass, if not the whole movie, is the Howell figure, wondering about the destruction, encountering a person they adhere to, and he loses them for some reason. There are no more than two people on camera at any time, but most of the movie. It's as if they filmed three at once, it would put the movie over budget or something. So the only and significant only clear adaptation of the WAR OF THE WORLD's story is the GEORGE PAL version right back in the 1950s. The black hole
