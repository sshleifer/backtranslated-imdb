man was hard to see! It was not fun at all, not well made, and it had no point or plot for it at all. the action was horrible. it was not well done at all. It looked like a bunch of kids, my age just slipping around and making a meaningless movie. It is by far the worst broken lizard movie. If you are a broken four-legged movie like myself, you will be disappointed and bored to your death. Please skip this meaningless movie about the ugly guy looking for chickens. You will not regret m advice. By the way, don't say you didn't find this review helpful just because you didn't agree. It's stupid, like this movie. The only OK scene was when the lead star played rugby and knocked out crap. I liked the reason I found his character pretty amazing.
