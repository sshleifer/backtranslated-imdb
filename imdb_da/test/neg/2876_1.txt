For me, Bollywood movies are generally not too much, even though they are still much wanted, and Bollywood is a big movie case as they have their own fans. The only motive that made me see the movie was to see to what extent an American actress could change or influence the logic on which the Indian film was based. Not only did it not change the film history, but this mixture also resulted in some ridiculous events. I think it's pretty common to see lots of illogical things through Indian movies, as they have their own world in their movies. But when you see such events happening to an American, it makes you laugh. For God's sake, you might think that a famous American actress is stuck in a desperate situation and feels relentless. Can you imagine an American actor in love with a dance instructor whose fianc√© was already in love with the American boys and they met at the same time. There were many similar things to mention. The less said the better. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was wrong as I had expected too much from Indian movies.
