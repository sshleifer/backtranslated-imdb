This is a silly movie. When I saw it in a movie theater more than half of the audience left before it was half over. I stayed at the bitter end. To show resistance? I caught it again on TV and it was much more fun. Yet in no way a classic, or even consistently fun, but the family kindly grew on me. I still love Jessica Lundy. If you have nothing better to do and it is free at t.v. You could do worse.
