42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with clothes on", but it is not at all in the same league as his far superior Tarzan series. Basically, The Jungle Jim series became a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller after he began to fall too low for a lingerie. In Jungle Jim, he is fully clothed. It cannot be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screenshots or production quality. It's pretty hokey stuff. This is the first one in the series, and it doesn't say much. Too much stock footage is used and it is so obvious. The score is exaggerated and the plot is paralyzed and the production is so bad it makes it hard to see at times.
