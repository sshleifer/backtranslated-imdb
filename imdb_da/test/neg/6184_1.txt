So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born the fourth of July among others call them "leftist propaganda films." Now it's my turn to take a political shot on a movie. For me, this film is very impressive on certain religious beliefs and on its political views. The action and writing were a bit cliché to my taste. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and prove it again by working with his partner Randall Wallace for another. Throughout this movie, there was this prototypical garbage bin "Just tell my family, I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before going to bed" lines. It was so overloaded with these garbage retread lines that I felt I had vomited. What about the scene where Gibson's wife goes to make the laundry, and these "no colors" apply to what should be put in the washing machine. In the mid-60s, she was someone stuck under a rock that didn't feel racism around her. Another scene is where Gibson's daughter asks him which war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. The management showed it all perfectly. The countless scenes from Gibson and his family or soldiers pray. I'm fine with showing it once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to push something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag in its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also made it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What was just won. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slow scenes, watching the US flag in distance scenes scattered through. I love America, but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do. <br /> <br /> It may seem like a rant and maybe it is, but I can't hold it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious not so patriotic that they will agree with something their country looks bad. This movie for me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me, if you are not your Christian, it is wrong. Would God or Jesus have people to kill, I do not believe. For me, this movie was offensive. First, this movie was fun with the countless clichés and exaggerated scenes, but when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or didn't say, it was really frustrating to see. I guess even though it's my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope nobody takes this comment offensively because I do not criticize religion or patriotism, but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discounting everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you want a real portrayal of the Vietnam War from Plato, born the 4th of July, Apocalypse now, the deer hunter or the killers. Even the Full Metal Jacket, which I absolutely hated, was a better portrayal. I've read a quote that says a true patriot doesn't go with everything the government or country does, but asks when it's wrong. A true patriot loves their country too much to see it does bad things.
