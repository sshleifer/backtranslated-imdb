The "plot" in this movie contains a few holes that you could drive through a massive truck, but I do not always expect that it is not always high priority in horror. Two older rural sisters in England are holding their brother in the basement since more than 30 years. Now, he fled and started a killing, focusing on military-based military personnel. "We only thought it was best for him," they continue to repeat and? strange ?? All chief officers love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of their men died. I do not know if I should find the revelation near exciting? or boring! Somehow, this movie reminded me of "Arsenic and Old Lace". In the black comedy classic, two half-insane siblings also meet their stupid younger brother, but they also kill. However, the old ladies in 'The Beast in the Cellar' are no less crazy. "Horror" in this early 70's movie is very amateurish and inexpensive, but there are a few nice attempts to build the excitement. Too many "old ladies" talk about the good oil days, but it is seldom something you are looking for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by classic movie buffs, plays one of the sisters. She pictured the Queen of England is the legendary Errol Flynn swashbuckler movie, Sea Hawk.
