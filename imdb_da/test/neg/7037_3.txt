Although I have rarely flown myself, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film has added the precious laughing layer in the flying cinema. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does Captain make Earth control? Why does he even measure the oil levels in the engine? With turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY DOES THE SKILL SKILL FOR AIRCRAFT? Strange kind of pressure check. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All large, western, two-motorized jets built since the 1980s have a crew of 2 people. Now try guessing how old the movie script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter manages to fly along with the curly airfield. Must be quick ... and the captain's words to explain "maneuver" to the passengers are really fun! <br /> <br /> 5. With arrested elevator rods, it is always possible to lower the aircraft's nose. This happens, for example. When an aircraft moves slower than the stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. The lift tubes have hydraulic actuators. After the collision with the business aircraft, it would probably have separated the hydraulic lines, making them unusable for steering, but would NOT fix them in a particular position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the evening town was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight for the fire, no matter who actually trained to do it ?? controller. <br /> <br /> 8. At the time of the collision, the aircraft's elevators would have been in a neutral position. The movie could be completed here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three pillars on his uniform. In fact, aircraft engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain scrubbing the cabinet with an ax to examine the damage behind? I thought it would have been the flight engineer's duty to carry out technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. In any plane there is no unused space. At least commercial aircraft cannot afford the luxury of a room that can be filled with plenty of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on again ... but eventually I laughed hysterically about how the authors imagine air disasters! Woooohooo! Most flight disasters happen in such a short time that you simply can't make 90 minute flicks out of them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with scary and insane crap, regardless of the genre.
