Found an old VHS version of this movie in my parent's house so I thought I'd give it a ride. Right from the start, I don't expect much from this movie, and I'm happy about it because it wasn't generally good that the movie was. <br /> <br /> The working overall was very poor, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. A scene with a radio controller stands out as being so pitiful that I found it fun that this scene was not cut. The first 30 minutes of the film had hardly developed a plot, and I didn't know what was going on. <br /> <br /> The story itself had the ability to be decent, but either the director was just bad or tried too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the movie. I managed to see it all, but I will probably never see this movie again.
