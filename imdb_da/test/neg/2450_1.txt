I crossed the box "contains spoiler" if I say something that is a spoiler and do not realize that I have said it before I read it again after I submit. So that's just the case. <br /> <br /> Anyway back to reviewing this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on skymovies earlier this afternoon, and with the description sky giving you (these people must be sad) it sounded pretty good, but when I actually got about 30 minutes into it, I was horrified. This movie, in my opinion, has the worst scriptwriting and actors / actresses - ever. The young girl who falls in love with the boy from L.A after approx. 3 hours, is a really stupid, lame character that has an annoying whiney voice and boff hair. -.-. Then there is her lover who is an idiot and it is also very whiney. In fact, they may suit each other. Then there is the boy's mother who is with him on vacation, and surprisingly surprised - she is a doctor, and - Oh my God, wait, there are even more unnoticed surprises! A virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows everything about viruses! = O. SHOCK HORROR! Yeah right. Laugh out loud. Then there is this crazy religious boys who continue to be "offered" or something and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love him, but he is actually a stubborn, arrogant, steroid pump (you really need to see this movie just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim, his head is like little and his body is massive, it's fun) buffoon who has too much to drink. <br /> <br /> circumstances, after all these usirdo characters, including a rocky-looking taxi driver, finally give the religious boy to the doctor and she is taking a blood test and they go directly to work to find the cure for it, for some reason he is dramatic been saved right down to "is and God." AND OH ME GOD Yes, there is another surprise !! You will never guess what !! Just in time, with 11 minutes to go before everyone on the island fall dead in fact, including her son and his girl, she finds the cure and injects al laugh and that's all resolved !!! What a pathetic movie. I think I knew it sounded an obvious end when I first started to see it, but I actually did, although it would be good and get some sub-plot phrases somewhere, but no, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You will end up like me - stunned for 3 hours and then demanding an hour and a half you spent your life and looking back.
