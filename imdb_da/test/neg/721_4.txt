I was loaned this DVD by the director of a movie I work with where I play an actor playing Prospero. Knowing her own style, I didn't expect anything like a "classic" interpretation of the text. What I have found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and boring. As in most experimental music, I find that in films like this, the building blocks for powerful film production are designed, although they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> Thus we have a Caliban, which is more of a clown than a threat, and not even Miranda seems terribly afraid (which is odd as we know he has tried to rape her at least one walk). A Stefano and Trinculo that are more annoying than fun. A strange young Prospero, similar to Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized positioning. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I have no problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her little freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this is a bad movie but an experimental one. One who takes big risks, but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in Tempest for their own sake.
