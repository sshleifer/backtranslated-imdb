In fact, I was quite surprised to find out that a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something I would consider a strong point in the game universe. No worries, but as in typical Ball mode, the story in the movie has little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain freedoms need to be taken to transfer from one kind of media to another, but it seems like he's not really even trying to connect. It's not just that, but the action and action sequences are so black, it almost makes you feel that the whole project was a big joke. It has been said a million times before, but why couldn't any more talented pick up video game rights to make a movie ????
