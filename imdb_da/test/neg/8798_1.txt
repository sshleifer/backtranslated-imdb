OK, before I get into this, let's go ahead and get the warning out of the way: This movie is the hallmark "cinematic" definition of SLEAZE! There are movies out there that can surely be shocked or disgusted in this movie, which has WAY more artistic validity than one can say to this turd of a movie. So what makes it so much fun? Let's take a closer look at "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ...... <br /> <br /> Made in 1974 for almost nothing, this "roughie" has no real genuine "plot" to talk about other than to describe what would happen if a family went into the desert to relax and spend a day while being accosted by a fat guy in a ski mask with a machete looking for kick ..... the kind that end up being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked crib. So those who are sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere. Then, to really either add a level of surrealism or simply show a complete imperfection to the art of making movies, the group's "daughter" runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black guy (!) Bound to a tree branch ("... that fat sum bitch left me here for 3 days ...") with almost no explanation !! He's saved ..... or is he? Of course not!! They are trapped before they can escape, where our murderer forces them to also have sex while forcing the mother to join, ending with a dead black guy (courtesy of a hatch through the chest) when all is said and done. Then our murderer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women gets to grips with the machete ........ and the film finally breaks !!! Just like that! No warning, no bound loose ends ..... it's simply over. Now it can be a real ending to this movie (I honestly don't know), but I've only seen the extremely raw Alpha Blue Archives version. Their version seems to have the finish either cut out, or it ends. If this was intentional, then in Film-making 101, I'm sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on HOW to finish a movie, but it shouldn't be done like this! Fans of the movie "Psycho" should be delighted to hear the soundtrack music as it is all through the movie! I would be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything. Even though this is a "violent" movie, there is nothing hell of it, so gorehounds find nothing of real use here. None of the violence is shown graphically. Only the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a machete just above the vagina area). Also sexy are some of the UGLIEST sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is too ugly a movie to work as an effective erotic porn or turn someone on, but those who tend to like things that are fun, uncomfortable and ugly, but not violent enough to Get some real infidelity with those who look for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other flicks like that. The only "infamous" thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult movie, a fairly new concept at that time, especially when considering than pornochic was all the rage and gates that filled 42nd Street, played things like this to a most combed group of porn mavens. This was not and is not "mainstream" porn at all. <br /> <br /> If you were in film school and there was a list of movie-made "don'ts", this movie would be a shining example of that lesson! This movie shows what happens when cerebrent challenged filmmakers get a "budget" (in this case probably about $ 142 ..... cuz it looks!) And ignores all "don'ts" and makes them " do's "..... yes, this movie is so bad !! Yet another thing: Those who are offended by race episodes are also encouraged to see something else. The black man in the film is constantly mistreated about his color and the killer is of course racist, but there was no political correctness in the early 70s. I'm not sure a movie like this could be made today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this will not "shock" anyone or title anyone, but those who are embarrassed. In fact, I was bored. Gender is so ugly and everyday, it's hard to see with any sense of eroticism, so if you do, you'll thank God for the fast-forward button! "Acting" if you want to call it is at best amateur (I mean, it's even bad for PORN!) With no reason to worry about anyone or anything in this !! If you just want to see this anyway, download it as you will really feel like a heel if you buy this. Some things are simply worthless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" are. The only thing that was more unpleasant than watching this movie would look at this movie sitting in a theater and looking around at the others who are participating in seeing it too, and suddenly feeling insecure. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you are up for some stupid, yet SLEAZY porn waste, give it a crack. It is 54 minutes and yet it feels much longer !! Crackheads would love this! So again, maybe there is something wrong with me to search it here in the first place ...... LOL! Caveat emptor, sleaze lovers !!
