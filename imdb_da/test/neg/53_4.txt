I do not understand it! Teenage leaders in "Horror Star" are apparently all devoted horror fans, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away, they dig their bodies and do all sorts of disrespectful things like disco-dancing it around the house and throwing food leftovers the. It doesn't sound like any real horror fans would do now? I am a big horror fan and I immensely idolize rejected icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never come to mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead ?? Admittedly, after a s√©ance ?? to wipe them all out of the earth's surface! Sir. Radzoff was not already known for his kindness in life when he occasionally killed the directors who did not agree with his visions, and even after his death, he suffered from a huge ego. Even within his grave, there are video messages to decay potential visitors, and the group of teenagers will find that he also enjoys the murder business outside his movie set. "Horror Star" (a.c. "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a beautiful lame 80's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy. The movie suffers mainly from its own stupid plot, since no one? not even a film school student ?? is stupid enough to steal a newly buried corpse and actually believe he is getting away with it and there are too many boring moments to fight through. Conrad's video spies from beyond the grave are far too talkative and certainly undermine the excitement, but on the other hand, his killing methods are pleasantly inventive. A teenager has the experience of being cremated alive and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Loses his head in a nice foreclosure sequence. In the most absolute order, a poor girl's head is crushed by a coffin. Author / Instructor Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay tribute to vintage horror cinema and of course he how to make movies look sinister. The locations and scenery are good, but Vane lacked the means to give his film a proper continuity and editing job. The imagined performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs, who deliver the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good movie, but it is worth tracking if you are a fan of enthusiastic B-horror.
