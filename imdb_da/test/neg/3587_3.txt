We've seen a story like this before: A wife in marital problems (played by Nastasja Kinski) engages in sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then goes back to her life with husband and girl. When she returns home, she finds out that her husband has finally found a job. Everything seems bright. However, Kinski finds out that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger still showing interest in her and seems to do everything to get what he wants. What to do? Say nothing? <br /> <br /> I really didn't like the movie. Although it wasn't just bad, it clearly lacked "it something". Perhaps it should have focused more on what goes into Kinski's head. Nothing to say about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for the observer's role), but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical and seemed like they would see signs appearing in your daily television films. Finally, the end was completely destroyed, what could have been an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie was looking cool, it had shaken some camera work here and there, some stills, quick cuts and glamor, but in the end I think it fits spelling productions much better. The same goes for the music. Otherwise it didn't look so bad. <br /> <br /> Some like this, but it was definitely not my cup of tea. To be fair, I usually don't see much on this type of thriller. This felt too long, although it was only an hour and a half, I think it could have worked better as an hour long episode in some TV shows. There was absolutely no need for any of the scenes, especially the shower. <br /> <br /> My advice: Try before you buy!
