Emperor New Groove was a wonderful twist for Disney. It wasn't a musical! It had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a fun funny movie. Kronk's New Groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3-year-old still loves the Emperor's New Groove, but fell asleep under Kronks. There really is no real conflict (as in the first movie leading to all the crazy adventures). Because of the lack of conflict, it almost seems like the animators threw out the authors and just made the story up when they went together. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun. . . and still is.
