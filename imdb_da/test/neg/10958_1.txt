New rule. No one is allowed to make multiple Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not. They assume that Bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers. Well, trouble with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not just collect ten bounties for a zombie? Why not just kill an ordinary person and pass it on like a zombie finger? <br /> <br /> Not to mention the complete silliness of hunting zombias with a bolt action rifle. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I think movies like this are CV fillers for makeup and FX guys. "Hey, that's what I did with ten dollars and some recycled bottles of deposit. Imagine what I could do if you gave me a budget!" Do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie? "I went to the Art School. Check me out as" Tunnel Zombie "in" Quick and the Undead "." His mother must be so proud. These should be the wimpiest zombies ever, as a whole lot of them apparently could not push down a wooden door or even break a glass window. No, they had to wait for bounty hunts to open the door for them ...
