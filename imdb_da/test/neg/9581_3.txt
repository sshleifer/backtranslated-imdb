Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence in this movie is to be believed, the hardest mountain to climb successfully without being killed. "K2" is basically a buddy put in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography takes in some really amazing scenes, the characters that stand in front of all the glorious landscapes are a crash, and the bug lies in the whole movie. Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) are using their spare time climbing. During one of their trips, they meet with another bunch of climbers funded by the rich mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). The Claibourne's team is training for an upcoming shot on the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold will both love to tackle, but never afford to do so. During their training, however, two of Claibourne's teams are killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold set out as potential replacements. Despite the original reluctance, Claibourne gives them the key to approval, and the couple finds themselves in his team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul) is worried that her husband will take on such a dangerous rise, especially since he recently became a father. Tensions in the climbing team mount as Taylor repeatedly collapse with another member of the group, the straight brash and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne grows more and more ill as heights are taking his toll on his body. Will the boys reach the top of K2 or is their mission destined to end in disappointment or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" takes a very long time to introduce its somewhat eerie characters. Biehn as a foul-mouthed, pushy, adventurous type is especially hard to suffer, like Barry as the hard-hitting mountaineer millionaire. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it becomes hard to believe that his wife might get an enemy of him to climb K2 - hey, she'd be better if he never came back !! Rounding off the main characters is Bercovici, whose characterization as Dallas Woolf is like a campy and over-the-top like any other role he has ever played. The story itself is quite tame and one-time just a straight yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. There is a bit of male bonding thrown in, but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife constitutes zero, and personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas ring fake. "K2" scores only few benefits from the amazing filmography of Gabriel Berastain ?? During the Himalayan sequences, the wave's scale and awe are quite well taken. I am totally with critic Kim Newman on this, who hilariously stated in Empire magazine: "On this proof, climbing K2 cannot be harder than sitting through it!" Quite true, Kim, absolutely true!
