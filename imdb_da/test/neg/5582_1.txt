It's amazing how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable. For those of you who appreciate carefully special effects and unthinkable details in each shot, you will see this movie in awe. Simply because Predator Island contains none of this. It's a redundant remake of all horror monster movies in the last two decades. Now I appreciate bad horror movies, they have some flare for humor in the most dramatic circumstances. But if your goal is to create a memorable work that will be engulfed in the Cult Hall of Fame, then my first suggestion is to find some imagination / creativity plus get some talent. Oh, and a few extra bucks to put in your picture. <br /> <br /> A horror movie tradition has been shocking the audience with violent deaths and doing. However, shock does not deliver more than a few seconds. In order to truly evoke a satisfying response from paying the crowd, there should be b sign development, some identifiable features. I know you're probably saying this guy doesn't give anything intelligent to the filmmakers, he just says an amateur remark. Well, it goes to show you how the amateur movies are. <br /> <br /> Despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver lining. The performance of Dan Gordon as Chris is amazing. He gets nothing to work with in a script and yet he can get out of the movie that looks like a star. Of all the players, he is the only one who believes in what he recites. He not only gives the audience with someone we can identify with, but we also have someone we look forward to seeing so that we can get through the rest of the movie. Gordon shows real talent and the ability to draw quality work and overcome a huge obstacle, that is, the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon is going to be a star, hopefully sooner than later. That is, if he can get away from movies like this one that will keep him back.
