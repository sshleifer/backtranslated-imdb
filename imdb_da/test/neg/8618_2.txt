This movie "Vampires: The Turning" is not even really worth 2 out of 10 I give it. The movie is very predictable from the start, ultimately when our hero kills the leader of Vampire Slayers. The use of music in this movie was even bad, it continued to play as if you expected something significant to happen in a second, even though it never did. The action was B-Rank at best and the movie was just boring. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential, even though it ended up being unable to deliver. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this movie was, of course, inexpensive for "non-existent" because our hero and his girlfriend (whom he tries to save throughout the film) carry the same clothes throughout the film. I would only suggest this movie if you are really bored and do not have a good wall with fresh paint to look dry. ~ Dave, Horror Cowboy
