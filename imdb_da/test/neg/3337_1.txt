The movie contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely great for a lady 56 years old, but that is the only saving grace in the movie. Otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script, and the leading actress has none of Deneuve's appeal. The director looked too many Peter Greenaway movies and Pola X came across as a student's imitation of the Greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.
