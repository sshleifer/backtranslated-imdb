Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the obnoxious propaganda Moore is trying to call "humor." The fact that this film and Moore's other curses actually attract admirers shows that it is unfortunately possible to fool some of the people all the time. Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if we can equip outdated factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can isolate Charles Lindbergh. The only thing Moore lacks in relation to Lindbergh is a medal from GÃ¶ring. <br /> <br /> Certainly in this movie, Moore had some self-discharge to his schtick. In this movie, Moore Roger Smith, general manager of General Motors, mocks as an independent, eerie elitist. Moore could do so in 1989, but now that Moore has surrendered to devoted, scary elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has an ironic twist. Who would rather not be Roger's mate, than Michael Moore?
