Another new comedy that shows that Hollywood can't even do the basics when it comes to filmmaking, as it used to do in its sleep for decades. If the author / director had brains, they would have based the movie about Stamp's character by tyrant boss Jack Taylor. When he is in the movie early, it is nothing special, but it is mildly promising and occasionally entertaining. When he departs for the majority of the movie, and Kutcher has his "hilarious" adventure, sitting with the guest after the dull guest falling in, the movie is popping up completely. <br /> <br /> As a result, what should have been a passable timewaster becomes an unfortunate stinker.
