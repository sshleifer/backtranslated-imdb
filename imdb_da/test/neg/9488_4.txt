One of the more prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt woman falls to Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then continues to betray Kirk and Enterprise as if loyalty was a non-existent feature of the ship. Wondering what kind of psychology tests this seemingly brilliant Starfleet user to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink of an Eye" when a red-shirt man takes the enemy side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS. (In that episode, however, the stock plays a small role in the overall plot.) This is very stupid because the Church crew again acts as a bunch of soft-headed, light-to-impressive morons, who - when they fall in love with the enemy - are capable to do just about anything. The fact that McGivers returns to Kirks does not improve the illogical in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... Why is Khan holding an ordinary door when they know he has superior strength? It is one of several ST plot devices that undermine Church intelligence. Why is Khan holding a knife against McCoy's neck? If Khan is of such superior intelligence, one would expect him to become more crazy about the way he carries on. And what about a sikh played with a latino accent? Montalban should have been given a vocal coach. I waited half to hear the "plaaainen!" in the background at any time. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship's captain) give limitless use of the ship's library to the inside technical details of the company to anyone? Is Starfleet an institution consisting solely of idiots? <br /> <br /> The SS is a very cartoon-like, silly episode, so it's no wonder Trekkies love it. It doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what Trekkies hates the most. It also shows that the ST franchise chose to revive this boring character to the second movie, thus pleasingly healthy Trekkies, who were so much disappointed with the first movie that - you guessed it - had too much sci-fi for the average little Trekkie brain.
