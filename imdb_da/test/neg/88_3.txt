Wow, what overrated movie it turned out to be! It was supposed to be "an extremely exciting story of a scary murderer who keeps a woman hostage and terror in his home." Well, I doubt the terrorist audience in the early 50s, and I know it would put today's audience to sleep. <br /> <br /> "Sending tremors down the back," the New York Times proclaims. No, the only shakes I get are that someone is back on the planet who thinks something NY Times prints about something. It was about a fake man who kept a woman's friend for a short time in her house but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and kind. In fact, this was one of the best roles Ryan has ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was nuts, but he never hurt the woman and only wanted a friend to trust. <br /> <br /> The movie even got boring after a while with very little going on except for a lot of yaking. <br /> <br /> Beware, my reader ..... it stinks.
