The Brave seems to show that the protagonist is, of course, brave. I would disagree. The more courageous things to do in a situation like the one that happens to her - being brutally merged with her fiance who doesn't live another day from it - must go after the criminals without resorting to a totally distorted view of society. Jodie Foster's character, Erica, is a radio personality whose niche goes on the streets and captures what's going on. We have no real depth except that she had one she loved, he died, the police did not pursue it, she gets a gun, yada-yada-yada, she gets something but not really involved in the main detective 'into the character, and then left something left over from previous films: the vigilant code of justice, where you take power in your own hands, is all there is. But we are never quite sure whether Erica is sane or not, if the filmmakers take a position somehow (it is until the end, which is such a silly message to take anyway with the dog as a indulgent metaphor) while making New York City today, which has become considerably safer than twenty years ago, looks as if you are knife or beaten if you go straight straight or just sit alone on a subway. <br /> <br /> There could even be some better movie in the midst of all this - perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with Terence Howard's detective, who is involved in a custody of a child who is not his and a woman where he is not attached to and a stiffer, which I do not know what except to own parking spaces and be a bad guy - but we are back to a manuscript that is both skin-fisted and uneven with logic. For example, it becomes ridiculous to see that the logical side of Erica initially could not shoot right, as seen in her first shot in a grocery store at a convenient time for a wife's robbery of the man - and then make room for the illogical by her crack-shot at shooting at a pimp, a car drives her head and kills him and ducking just in time for not getting over. It doesn't help that Jordan's style with the camera gets a little more than insufficient: it's called a place-cam for a * reason *, not because it can weave in and out. Ironically, scripts and direction become very good, or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances: When looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge, caught between a videotape viewpoint of one of the criminals at the regular movie camera in a pace that is completely disorienting. And when Erica first comes back in the air to her radio program, and she freezes up trying to make her old shtick and tells a "heart" about how scared she is - this scene from Foster's performance to the clear direction and script is the best scene in the movie. But apart from that, there is only a lot set in a psychology that is flimsy: is she a De Niro in taxi driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We have her story about scenes, some of it does not have to do with her radio program, as we observe how wild she is going at night, nothing but her self-imposed task of cleaning up the street. But unlike the desire of death, a movie that had more ambiguity and never held an answer in the end in a revenge scenario, the way of infinite violence goes just to a message, one that will not be news for anyone who has seen a second of life movie-of-the-week melodrama. The actors do what is given, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating to try to stay with the expected, the chopped plot turns and the ordinary old inexplicable (plus the unintentional hilarious that a few explosives cried by Howard after being shot in a scene), and the temptation to go out grows stronger and stronger. It is a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of genuine interest and clear convergence bending.
