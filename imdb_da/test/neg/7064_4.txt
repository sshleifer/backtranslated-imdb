This is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows, a particular Dixie Boy Johnson. Whether this person ever really existed, I do not know, but given the cast, a particular "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns also list playing, I suppose the man existed and that this is a whitewashed pun version of his career. The reason it is, follows Dixie Boy from career heights to depression at his wife's death at birth, his surrender of the child to friends, and his return to his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a nice baritone voice, but no acting talent at all and is a dull lump on the screen. Gladys George safely tries his best to experience the works for no avail. Judy Clark makes the best impersonation of Betty Hutton I've ever seen, although I think she thought she was herself. The score filled with many music tracks for its short duration of 70 minutes earned a deserved Oscar nom. Worth a visit.
