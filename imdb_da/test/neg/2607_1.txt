Wow. After watching this movie, you will know why the US youth still lacks intelligence and every move to contribute to the well-being of society, except to make itself more inactive. <br /> <br /> Jackass number two stars some of the most likely people imaginable, who essentially lack any kind of talent or brains to do something by themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and There was only the fame to make living entertaining as stupid as they are to hurt it. A guy drinking horse seed? Just flat disgusting. A man who puts a fish by his cheek and acts as "bait" for sharks? This is not humor, it is evidence of institutionalization of him. <br /> <br /> All in all, I left the theater without hope for humanity.
