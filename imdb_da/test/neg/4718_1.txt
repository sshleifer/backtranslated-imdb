In this terrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, a lot of people go to Africa to investigate a being called Half-Caste. It is quite obvious that there was no script to talk about and that everything was improvised. It can work if you have good actors that this movie did not. <br /> <br /> This movie is trying to get points for originality by exploring a fuzzy myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes out in the bush where signs make "quirky African stuff" like eating elephant dung. There are also really good pictures of lions eating (from a national geographical perspective), but there is not a single scare in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie won't surprise you, and you might see better lion recordings on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a Half-Aste bet. <br /> <br /> A note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save "How I excited my African Vacation" movie to your family and close friends. No one else will see it.
