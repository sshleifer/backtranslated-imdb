In the mid-1990s, the career of animator instructor Don Bluth seemed to fall to his all-time low. Previously, Bluth had made a number of popular animated films, many of which are still loved today as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" (1986). But the beginning with "Thumbelina" in 1994 seemed his film to fall increasingly in quality and popularity, and one of the many unfortunate entries is the 1995 office bomb "The Pebble and the Penguin", a film that did not attract the audience beyond parents and children under 7 years. Frankly, the latter are the only audience members I can understand taking pleasure in this rather gentle animated feature. The story is absurd. The movie stars a badly drawn, stuttering and shabby penguin named Hubie (pronounced by Martin Short), who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (voice by Annie Golden). BLACK as in real life, penguins present their bride-to-bee with a stone as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is swept away by the present, he joins a lonely rockhopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying, and they struggle against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they might be too late are one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak, even though they were there. It becomes very clear very early why this animated children's musical does not and will not work for anyone older than say six or seven years. It just doesn't have any of the qualities required for a good animated feature. Number one, the movie looks bad because of a very bad cartoon. The animation in this movie is very cartoon-like (just as animated movies go); it is dark, gloomy, there is no vibration in the colors, and besides that, the film's design and elements of the universal droll and ridiculous. Take, for example, the penguins in the movie. With just a few background excerpts, every penguin sees nothing at all like a bird. For example, Hubie looks ridiculously ridiculous with wide cheeks, a stumped beak, big eyes and the upscale hat he wears wherever he goes. Combined with his hand-like "flippers" he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin dress. Result: He is a nasty, badly drawn cartoon character. But the most absurd look and absurdly-designed character is the evil penguin, Drake, who honestly sees nothing like a penguin. He is a muscular man wearing a penguin mask. He has a chest wider than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killer whales, which serve as the film's predator. Basically he is a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a cave shaped like a skull, he wears a robe, laughs a lot and becomes angry when people laugh at him. Result: who cares? And it is also bad, and perhaps worse, that this is an animated musical, and there is not a single remarkable or memorable song that exists anywhere within its rhythm. The opening alarm was harmless ?? not memorable, but harmless. But after that, the songs became obscure and obscure, and there was one in particular that made me ugly all the way through. This is the moment the viewers press the fast-forward button each time it comes up. <br /> <br /> I felt "The Pebble and the Penguin" was lame around to save in the very few moments when Hubie and Rockhopper Penguin Rocko are threatened in jaws of leopard seals and killer whales, which fortunately did not get dialogue and treated like animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a way, I cannot therefore wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children. This is the reason. The film shows killer whales is the natural predator of the penguins. My concern is that children who are familiar with "Free Willy" (1993) may be offended or discouraged by seeing their favorite seafarer portrayed as bloodthirsty carnivorous. The leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more fun seeing how his jaws were opened wider than a rattlesnake and how he seemed to smile while growing. But the point is really, these moments with the predators and there are only a few ?? are the only interesting moments. And they are not very interesting, think of you. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I can't recommend this to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: If you have kids around that site, rent it for them. They like it.
