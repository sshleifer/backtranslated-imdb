Being a child in the 1980s, I grew up with several educational and derivative programs (or both) and continue to learn so much from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. Having learned that Sesam Street to name the best example, was not only responsible for the fact that I could read at an adult level before I could go, it only increased the level of disgust that I did not only feel about Lyons Corporation and its product, but those who defend them too. As if I had confidence in those we were allocating to protect us or our children at first, the fact that Barney & Friends still pollutes our air waves after more than a decade later, discredits not only the FCC, US trade, and Its decision makers, it is a discredit for all of humanity. However, in a world where I can be harassed without police, welfare, and child protection agencies just to be born differently from them in power, broadcasters can pump this drive into my home undisputedly, you have to ask what is wrong with people. <br /> <br /> You see in a world where we are expected to behave as adults and account for ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is important because it will often have consequences long after we are gone . Not only is our attempt to make our children more normal, more similar, more imaginable, potentially devastating, what we end up teaching them to be normal plays also a major role. So the question becomes one of what Barney teaches our children to be normal. Aside from lessons like this, we are not good if we do not have good feelings or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up with short, other shocking things shown on the Barney show, including Barney, children are mobbing. The issue of child abduction and child crimes is great in our society and it has been since we started trying to pretend it was not, but it would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways to present the topic . <Br /> <br /> So far, I have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally harmful lessons Barney himself presents. The addition to the problem is that the kids appear on the show. I use the word children solved here, as the age group shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen. Nevertheless, there is no difference in emotional response to both extremes. Fourteen-year-olds respond to Barney and his proposed situations in the same way as five-year-olds. Experts in childhood and youth autism consider it particularly for an incredibly wild thing to expose children to. Adults on the autistic spectrum who were faced with growing issues such as their needs were not only met but flatly ignored, tending to see this and feeling an urge to do the kind of thing with Barney who would do fourteen years cried. As irreverent and ill as shows aimed at the older children's market that you can't do on television, they stumble across Barney by demonstrating that not only ages respond to the same thing in different ways, so also different people. <br /> <br /> So in response to mdmireles1295 I have to say that I hope as hell they don't have children. For every time I see a parent showing their child this drive, it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse. And I speak as a man whose total education was dominated by abuse. They can sing about manners, loving, caring or sharing, but the examples they show are not only so distorted that they are the opposite of educational ones, they are so devoid of realism as dangerous as the Light Triton has already pointed out. The kind of lessons children learn from Barney is that people do not vary, emotions must be suppressed at all costs, and rules are completely arbitrary. Compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around, and even the most bitter emotions have a purpose that television taught me as a boy, it still scares the idea that the authorities should not yet step in and push this garbage out of air. If a parent did for their child what Barney does around the world, they would face criminal proceedings. <br /> <br /> So I gave Barney my favorite two out of ten scores which I give to all the rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value. In a world of adults who know how to properly correspond to their children, it has no place.
