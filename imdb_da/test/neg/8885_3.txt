This movie had very little good points, the special effects and plays were terribly safe. But it was a movie made on a low budget so you don't expect much from it, it has some laughs (I doubt they are calculated though :)). The scene where the old woman bends down and touches the mouth that was on the floor, puts it on her nose and goes CHUPACABRA! in a really stupid raspy voice was invaluable. All in all, if you have nothing else to see and just want to laugh at a really crappy flick trying to deposit on Blair Witch Project's success, then take the second so it doesn't bother.
