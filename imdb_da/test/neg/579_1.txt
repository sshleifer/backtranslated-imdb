I'm a great Robert Taylor fan and I've been trying to find all his movies. This is one I did not have, but I recently saw it on the Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the play was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even poor and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the relationships from the screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry was on the screen between the two. But the film's premise was so ridiculous: that the US president would order a fleet Lt to leave the service secretly to chase bank robbers and only report to the president that it made it difficult to appreciate anything else about movies. Death row scenes were completely unmoving. The only thing worse than Taylor's play was Stanwyck's song. She got better later in the Ball of Fire ceiling sky.
