I hate this movie !!!!!! I have never seen such complete, complete waste in my life !!! I live in France so it turned out I was in the front to see this horrible movie. First, it seemed to be cool, as if something about a damned forest that chomp people. Unfortunately, it turned out that it was something completely different: a good start with a girl who meets a guy and all that is not, then the girl becomes threatening with messages in the form of ravens closed in her toilet cabinets (ridiculous) and furthermore begins the film to slip downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate thrashing in the process. The movie ends with plenty of drunkards and old ugly, smelly creatures that come back from the past to kill a few people. Many questions ran around my head at the time: Why the heck did they take back the scummy monster? Do you drink grapes dressed in bedding? Why did they even disturb this movie ?? "Climax" in the film was so boring that I laughed all the way through the "horrible" smelly monster fighting with the two young women (who seem to be expert kung fu masters) and the professor is cut in two or something. What surprised me was that the monster was so slow and innocent in combat, shouldn't it be a god of war or something? Anyway, the movie in its death throats was a miserable sight. A brief condensation of the contents of this film: Kung Fu mayhem + druidsten + mystical murder "Ã  la thriller" + old prophecies + shabby ravens + old lumpy boneless war god + nutty professor = complete and completely sick, boned, worm eaten, GODFORSEN, GODDAM , RECYCLED, FAKE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: - The warrior gods are miserable at kung fu. -All young women studying archeology at the University of France are kung fu experts. - Professors are so resilient that they can survive being cut in two by such a mass-whatchamacallit without damage.
