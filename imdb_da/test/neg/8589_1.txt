I've never seen a more unrealistic movie than this scary piece of fertilizer. The action was over the top. The direction was sticky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story was viewed by someone who has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was horrible and played the most unrealistic announcer ever. He couldn't even be hired to do professional wrestling competitions. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl. But he is a bit more athletic than the old Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to lead this movie in 16-year-old ADD men. That's why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and many edits. It was just a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino to make this crap. Cameron Diaz? Heck, no talent takes any role that comes down in the pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you come in, well, your movie sucks! And this does.
