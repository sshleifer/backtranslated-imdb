My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable TV. As one who saw revenge of the nerds in a movie theater, I found this movie for a very predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I drove her crazy by being able to predict exactly what would happen in each scene. The actor was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> The writer Chad Creasey was ashamed to write such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick. The title should simply be "Revenge of The Dorks." Perhaps the successor will be Revenge of Dorks 2.
