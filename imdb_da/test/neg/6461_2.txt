This show is amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Seen in Alaska, I do not agree with the homosexual content of the evening's show. I feel you are pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. It's one thing to have a New Yorker fighting in Alaska's wild, but to try to make Alaska town to New York? This is a great show about lovely women and genuine Alaska men, and bringing the same sex couple into the mix is ​​throwing the balance far away. Alaska should be portrayed as a man and New York as the woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all do. Can't we have a good show without nature's imbalance.
