How on earth did these guys get the money to make this movie? The lack of script is one thing, but the cinematography makes you want to cry. A handheld camera can be of great value to the appearance of a movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I am very aware that the actors are amateurs, but it is not a defense, as the director may be the least talented who ever leads in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if he (or anyone in the team for that matter) gets the money to make a movie ever again. This film simply provides fuel for the argument that too many films are made in Sweden every year.
