If I were British, I would be embarrassed by this depiction of incompetence. A protective agent from the special department that is unable to defend itself against a sick, unarmed and untrained attacker? The home office sends a single "science advisor" to investigate a possible level of four biohazards, and that "counselor" does not mean wearing a mask and gloves yourself? Fully unprotected police in London work side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits? "The counselor" and his bodyguards bear a sociopathic doctor experimenting with people without back-up? Puh-leeze! One wonders if the producers could not afford to hire technical advisers, or if for some reason they decided to portray the protagonists as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no background in either medicine or law enforcement, rolled her eyes into disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; Now that I have seen two episodes, I give up.
