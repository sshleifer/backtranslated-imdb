This music is completely out of touch with the film and now and again as the wagnerian bombast and Lone Ranger rush, otherwise non-existent. The action outside the two main characters is non-existent. It would have been an excellent student movie. The Russian soldiers are just models trying to act. The constant interruptions with wow-explosive camera angles and monochrome clips of pieces of people were rather annoying, but it's just a personal feeling. The story is no worse than others, in fact not worse than most, completely ignoring logic and reason and reality. At least no one went to a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. The top three bad guys were campy.
