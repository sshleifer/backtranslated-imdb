Contains spoilers! These guys are totally scam, they did Judas Lost Scrolls, saying Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now this? This is clearly an attempt to destroy a religion and should be illegal. They have no evidence, it could be clearly a setup. How can we know and trust these people? What if they cut the grave and "said it"? And at the end they seal the tomb forever, so no one can go there and investigate? How stupid do they think we are, really? Should we trust that they are trustworthy people? Who really found a grave of Jesus? And how can you stab all the Christians like this? I think this documentary should NEVER be made by a non-religious man. It can ONLY be made by a Christian, and I mean DIRECTION AND SCRIPT. It should be illegal for Jews to film a Christian-related documentary, especially if the documentary alleges that Jesus is not a "Son of God resurrected" (nothing against this, they could be Buddhists or atheists, anything but Catholic) . /> <br /> For me, this is a total hoax, a pure documentary scam. They sealed the grave, so people "wouldn't" think about checking things out. This documentary is a total failure, how stupid do they believe the Christian people? And what about Judah's lost pages? It was also a total scam, they eventually said to something: "We know a few people who could make false rolls like these, and no one would know it was a fake" ... Oh my God, they said it just "Dude, we could have done these" ... This kind of documentary should be illegal, it's a stabbing on all Christians and Catholics, they should be behind bars !!! I'm not fanatic, I'm an ex-Jew, now atheist, but I have valor and will always respect other people's religion. The part where Israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever was PRECAUSE! COSTLY!!
