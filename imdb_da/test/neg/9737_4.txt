For me, this movie was a disappointment. Somehow, I expected it to explain the reason for General Rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in WW II. But there is none of it about the last year or two of his life and trying on a way to launder him. So I just have to assume that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the victorious and killing business without any particular charm or infamy in behavior. Such real people just don't do good movie material. I'm almost sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors who had to imitate a beautiful wooden character. In fact, a good director and a lot of good actresses were wasted on this movie ?? with the exception of Luther Adler, who gives a truly memorable and odd naturalistic depiction of Adolf Hitler. There can also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors publishing the Germans are just not credible. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not only as a German but as a typical southern "from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. You immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain kind of white, a certain way of seeing the world (the total opposite of f. ex a Prussian junker "). I also think there are mixed feelings about the attempted murder on July 20th. Many of those who were on the conspiracy were not Democrats and would just join the German troops to the Western Allies against the progressive Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best filming of an intellectual, intelligent military mind is Patton (1970). Incidentally, General Patton can glimpse for a brief moment in the abundant documentary film used for this film, a low-pitched while inspecting passing vehicles. The open holster and the mother-of-pearl revolver are clearly visible!
