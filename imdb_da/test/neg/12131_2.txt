Waters contribution to the cinema world must be searched with a telescope, and when / when something has been found (with great chance and good luck), it must be analyzed with a microscope. <br /> <br /> And after being analyzed, it would be discarded in the lab's "garbage bin for completely useless things". A single atom in that microscope is worth combining all its films. CB is uniquely campy and intentional. The usual JW stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronic cheerful characters, chewing gum pop, overactive, etc. Waters knows he is not able to make a movie of quality so he hides behind the mask in "intentionally cheesy movie maker "- who allegedly makes him a special kind of" anti-artist ". But in the cinema world, it is often an antiptalist who often fails talent, which had just hoped - and finally. It's a consistent action. Charlatans attacks the cinema world and modern pop art; It's a plague. Maybe we blame John Waters for inspiring Baz Luhrman to make all those horrible, stupid turkeys. It's like a virus: a Waters creates five new bad directors, and then these five each create more and more. Where will it end? With "Dancer In The Dark"? Can that bomb actually be topped?
