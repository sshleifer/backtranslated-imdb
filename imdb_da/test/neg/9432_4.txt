A wonderful semi-humorous tribute to expressionist black and white films by people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character trapped in a cafeteria nightmare, at first thinking he is part of a vigilant group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect. The script is a bit forced (after all, Woody Allen is trying to be a coy Kafka), but the point is made and no harm done. The cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but be sure to look at a very dark room with a good screen, or details will be swallowed in the fog. This is an entertaining little movie with a few laughs that are actually snares of "uh-huh". The action is fine, considering the odd vehicle and it's worth seeing if you're the big Woody Allen fan. Also of interest to those who are knowledgeable about expressionist films. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.
