Now you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was just awful. The bad actors had no material to work with! <br /> <br /> The DVD deck invited you to a flight action girl. You'd expect something like Top Gun ... Huge disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that you get it broken. The aerial images are clearly taken from documentaries and some other recording sources not made for this movie. And they didn't even care about the brands or the giant models, taking for granted the audience wouldn't notice it. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story was paralyzed. With a little effort from the author and the director, it could have been very interesting. In short, it looks like a B-movie made in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry for these actors who put their names here. They must surely be ashamed.
