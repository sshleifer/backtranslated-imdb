After his father's suicide, Charlie 'Kid' (Ray `Boom Boom 'Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and travels to Las Vegas with him trying to become a boxer. On the way, they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals) hitchhiking, they give her a lift and she becomes Charlie's boyfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny to be Charlie's sofa, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after seeing him fight, becomes his leader and promotes Charlie's career. This movie is so boring that it doesn't deserve to spend much time writing about it. I don't like boxing, but sometimes I see some valuable movies on this theme. But this one is horrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, with a horrible main actor, a pure waste of time. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Corpo e Alma '(` Body and Soul')
