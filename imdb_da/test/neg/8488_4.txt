In fact, Mask's Son made me laugh a few times ... mostly because of the comics jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. CGI is very impressive and is widely used in this movie. Garfield, for example, is not as ready for CGI, but I would give the same voice. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which wasn't so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie ... and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good at her role. His attempt to act "crazy" is not very good, and overall action is poor. Everyone else is not that bad. In principle, my 2 and 5 year old saw all things without complaint. At least I was able to sit through this. <br /> <br /> There is no way that this movie is worse than ** shudder ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for CGI and a few laughs.
