During the university, our philosopher professor, Mr.R, played us "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still rather unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a soon-to-be-household name still busy picking up its fact-bending skills and still learning to manipulate the easily-impressed, pathological paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, illiterate, the half-lit, the clueless and the ridiculously happy among you. <br /> <br /> When we finished seeing it, I thought, "Yes, it was something entertaining - in a very bold Bugs Bunny kind of way - but what an ultra-biased, anti-capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity whatsoever, it is the only purpose to be to take cheap shots on people and ideas that the film's creator has the basement for. This is not a documentary of any kind of imagination. " R & M and we ended up not just criticizing any aspect of it, but Mr.R actually spent the rest of the class and praising his "qualities". Just so we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "seer manipulation", "leftist extremist" or "selective facts presentation" never left their eternally smiling mouth ... And just to remind that this should be a philosophy class, Don't indoctrinate your students with your own political BS course. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now I come to the really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr.R, is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-scripts with A-grade stars in them. <br/> <br /> The story is moral: they are the kind of people that all doors are open in Hollywood. <br /> <Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker (which he proved to be undoubtedly with "Canadian bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens doors to almost anyone. Tinseltown ranges from healthy pro-Chavez extremists, so political brainwashing through simplified reality accounts has been part of the Hollywood experience for many decades now. Embrace this demagogue and you have betrayed your own brain forever.
