I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and liked it very much. I don't know what happened to the movie version because it was terrible. Perhaps some of the dialogs that work on stage sound only incoherent on the screen. Anyway, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. The action is universally over the top. Only Kevin Spacey has it together and he seems to know he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.
