This film attempted to capture the naive idealism that many young teenage girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that they failed to establish these things at every level; why failed to build a decent story around them. I couldn't follow the point in any part of this story or any reason why I should break. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a pedophile exploration at all. It is basically about a girl in love with her sister, and her sister is in love with the idea of ​​"men". While the latter tries his men's love, the former tries to win back his sister by "becoming straight". The plot is weak, the signs are weak, and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur movie maker (without sexual substance).
