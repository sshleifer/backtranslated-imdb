Lucille Balls version of "Mame" is, in my opinion, one of the worst performances ever recorded on film. Having seen Lucy in his various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, but this movie is a failure of incredibly bad casting, music and dancing. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with some small enough to miss if you blink. I don't know what she was thinking, and I can't imagine how she was advised by the studio or the director, but I actually scared to see this embarrassing performance. I could be really cruel and suggest seeing it a laugh, but it is too pitiful to even qualify for it. Don't waste your money or your time.
