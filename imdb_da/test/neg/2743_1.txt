On the heels of the well-received and beloved old movie classic that relates to teen life as they are led in adulthood, George Lucas' American graffiti has Cooley High. An adaptation of varieties by an Eric Monte, co creator of the popular 1970s CBS sitcom Good Times. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was and is seen as a black version of American graffiti. Instead of central California, as in American graffiti, we have the black slum of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the backdrop to the story here. Instead of America in 1962, Cooley High is located in 1964. Movie Stars Welcome Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the film's main characters and its protagonists. Garrett Morris, who plays the lead, trying to keep Jacobs' and Turman's characters, called Coceise and Preach, out of trouble, has a lot of time. <br /> <br /> You want to say that Cooley High is a worthy comparison for American graffiti or that it's a great movie on its own, but I can't. The problem is due to the fact that film producers could not or would not hide the sad underside of black life in America. The whole movie in the Cabrini Green section of Chicago doesn't help. <br /> <br /> There is also nothing too rough attempts at humor here. When Coceise looks for a declaration of intent from a college, he finds that his little brother has thrown a toilet down. When the gang visits Chicago Zoo, one of the bands called Pooter has fertilizer thrown at him by a monkey. When Turman's character, Preach, is being chased by two hoodlums in the school's hangout (A dirty and depressing place to eat in much smaller meeting people), he opens the door to the girls' bathroom while a girl relieves herself as he escapes through the window at the same bathroom! The high school, the characters' home, the bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film, shows the unfortunate appearance of urban decay and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, there was a rough screen shot of humor in the movie. The use of violence and profanity in the film. Cooley High may be a movie of the coming age, but it is a tough and rough movie in the future with little or no humor and taste of the use of nostalgia that made people and appreciate American graffiti so much. <br /> <br /> Motown Records had a hand in making the movie. The company's music was part of the movie's soundtrack. But even here you get a sense of the same old same old as you have heard these songs before a million times over. Not that they were not good songs within themselves, but black music, of that period was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song approaches the end of the movie, by Spinners' G.C. Cameron, wasn't that impressive. There have been better Motown Ballads that have been made by better Motown artists than Cameron without question. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, showing where the characters went to pay tribute to the movie Cooley High, was meant to be American graffiti. It shows that Preach, an intelligent but submissive student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have patterned himself as Turman's character. The last shot of the movie show is Preach, which runs away from Coceise's funeral, held on a dark rainy afternoon and all the gloom that Cooley High came to represent. Eric Monte, through Preach and the last scene, had a little lesson for all of us when we looked at Cooley High and for the love of the past. Don't look back.
