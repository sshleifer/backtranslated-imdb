OK, I gave this a three A three! It only deserves a star without question. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie seriously and take it as a legit B-Horror movie than yes, it will get a star. But I think it's clear within the first few minutes of the movie what we're dealing with is a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> With this movie me and my buddy I watched it off with and put on some more "Hollywood" but instead we just decided to tear this whole movie apart from start to finish. We laughed so many times, it was almost if I looked at a comedy. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible ..... The effects and death sequences are so bad .... The story complete crap .. ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that they are trying to make a serious horror movie. Prick Less! The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters go into a presumably "dark basement" that is clearly lit, and they pretend not to be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the bahahahaha ceiling just awful ..... < br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh how crappy this movie is with it, it was made in 2004 than watch this movie .... Wait why do I write so much? no one knows about this movie ... i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.
