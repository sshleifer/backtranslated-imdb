Technically, this movie would have had it all: decent actors, a lovely landscape, no obvious sights of budget deficiency, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. The plot collection also sounds promising, suggesting a satire of stupid bureaucracy and ordinary people who extradite it. <br /> <br /> But it never delivers. The reason is simply too illogical. Throughout the movie, a person does not make a single sensible thing. Mad politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers - all just cramped from an incredible situation to the next. what they all do not have in a context beyond the current scene. Of course, this kind of film must be absurd and exaggerated. however, it must also have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts that unfortunately fail: the protagonist who does not seem to have a clue about what is happening to him, and the "author" who occasionally cracks jokes from what might be fun for an audience that only consisted of 12-year-olds. <br /> <br /> What I found most impressive is that the movie is trying to be fun all the time, but didn't make me laugh once. I've seen several bad "funny" movies, but yet each one contained at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense "puckoon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a fantastic movie with a comparable plot, check out "brazil". Don't waste your time on "puckoon".
