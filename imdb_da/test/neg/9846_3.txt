This film was, in one word, terrible. It was boring, predictable and even scary. I continued to wait for it to end, and when it did, I was horrified. The end left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. My advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality: Stay away from this movie. Movies like this give classics like Lolita a bad name.
