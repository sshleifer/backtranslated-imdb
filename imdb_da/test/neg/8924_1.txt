I ran over this movie on a local TV channel last night. Frankly, I have never heard of this movie before. I just wasted Seagual's latest movie, because each of them is worst than the previous one. Here again we have a boring Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he strongly accepted. The plot is ridiculous, plays are below zero, and there is no single aspect, the film does not fall apart. I simply have no idea why Seagal did this movie. Man, it's even worst than "Out for a kill"! If you see this movie, you will start to get sad Seagal. He seems to run out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
