I have to admit I was right from the start of this movie, but I tried my hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the very idea of ​​recreating a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky British classic full of character must be questionable from the beginning. <br /> <br /> People in my house saw this, so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be a film professional (I've studied them at Uni). <br /> <br /> As expected for an American film of this kind, the movie began with a chase that wasn't bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are credible, and this only lifts the selection. <br /> <br /> But the characterization was scary, but the seats could very easily have been spliced ​​from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to see and it lacked all character. Seeming an oblique angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery makes the American version the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with Donald's death. Sutherland's character. This allows our American cousins ​​the opportunity for sycophantic, deep-eye revenge seeking against the evildoers whom it milks to predictable profits. This is never as clear as in scenes with Charlize Theron (oh beautiful! Oh so beautiful! Look at her beautiful, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!), Who was thoroughly nauseating. Her entrance scene was especially like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider, which was both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't destroy a game like they could with British cinema that was already shocked by Spark, people you really feel like and moments of inspiration. But I go down, the full inclusion of a beautiful girl for its sake resembles just the most ham-fisted maneuver I've seen for a while, and reveals the cynical Hollywood blockbuster desire for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! If I had the opportunity to watch 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in this, I would have rejected. Likewise, Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that stuff). Unfortunately, all set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to make you think, "Wow! He's smart!", "Coo! He's cool!", "Hey! What a tough guy!" is there the 'funny PC guy' who has 'comic relief' scattered over his forehead, but whose humor content can be expected two minutes in advance, to be honest, if you have seen one or two movies like that, you can Easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer staff. Not that Jerry is irreversibly awful by the way, but he just uses the cliches for excess, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> This is where I I should not be able to make it to the end, so I couldn't even say if the brilliant end in the Michael Caine version did, but sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare movies that if I 'had seen it at a cinema, I would have gone out and arranged a small protest outside. It is not only that it is another identical firewall Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine, but didn't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamor, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a movie, but I couldn't recognize anything from the original. <br /> <br /> So if you expect 'THE ITALIAN JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14', though poorly written with a less established cast and characters, some creepy elements and cardboard cut-out script writing are not to be seen! I don't mind people who seem a bit of fun, but this is a criminal hatchet job that doesn't deserve to mate in any way under the title of a classic. Seriously, show pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my horrible and sickly reaction when I first heard that the movie would be made. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some of the action sequences are not bad at all, so add an extra '1' to the tag if you like this stuff.
