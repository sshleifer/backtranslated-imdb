Critics have begun to call it the Oscar Winner club, understandably. What after Halle Berry won it to Monster's Ball and then straight to the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Do not Cry and follows it with the core. Jamie Foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the boring Stealth after scooping a gong for Ray. Now it seems that Hollywood Starlet Charlize Theron craps his entire "Monster" Oscar with this of the worst sci-fi glasses ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie loses its audience interest after just 20 minutes, which means the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the fact that movies are bad Charlize Theron is still an extraordinary actress who clearly Make the best of a raw and ridiculous premise. Not only is Æon Flux ultimately low, but for an action flip it is also very boring. It will only really appeal to cartoon fans and Horney teenagers who like the idea that Theron runs about half naked in 90 minutes. Flux only succeeds in failing. Seen against the 2011 virus, killing 99% of the world's population, and in the last city on earth, Bregna, the survivors, about four hundred years later in 2415, continues to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist, who developed his cure. Everything is not good in this utopia, and it is not that beyond its high walls that protect its citizens from the endless jungle, but what unspoken, unwritten taboo possesses and binds these unwritten taboos that hold and bind these unlucky 'together, which lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and undoubtedly obedience. Filmed in and around Berlin, it is ironically a story that faces a totalitarian state, a walled city where its people are no longer able to reproduce, and its monstrous and secretive plot of how it maintains life. <br /> Æon Flux is the murder given by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind forever. This is the story of his struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Eon Flux combined miserable narratives, ropy pacing and truly bleak effects. Looks more like an unrealistic video game instead of a movie. The only thing that is fortunate about the error is that there are no successors in the work, Flux can just be the beginning and end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank God for the miserable checkout. <br /> <br /> My final judgment on this really miserable feature? There really isn't a story here just Charlize Theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass tray. The action is very wood-like and numb compared to the other cinemas out there today. It tries too much to be an adaptation and doesn't really take much of the comic book, which is what I expected. The only thing that was done half greeting the comic was flying in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
