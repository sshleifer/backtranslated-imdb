I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is reprehensible, weak and transparent. It only works at the level of the current fashionable (and tired) hate motif of white American Christian fundamentalism. Had this film been about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, the violence would have been tangible, and the film would have been featured in all circles. However, as it stands, it is "OK" and "artificial" because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for waste like this. <br /> <br /> The garbage it really is. If you want to watch a quality movie of a similar bent, find and watch or review the "Badlands". Nothing good was done in "The King", which was not made better decades ago in the masterful film. <br /> <br /> Like other reviewers, the characters are almost undeveloped in "The King", the lines are a snooze, the cinematography is lackluster. We have seen the history of sociopath done better 100 times. This movie does not cut it into thoughtful viewers.
