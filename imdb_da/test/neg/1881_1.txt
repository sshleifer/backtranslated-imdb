What really surprised me about this movie was that it rang so fake. First of all, who in the late 80s (when the film takes place) lived like this family? A college professor would not make enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in the movie. Therefore, he and his home wife will be afflicted by financial disadvantages, especially when she gets cancer. Second, Streep is my age, and most women, especially in their class (educated, white, well-developed) experienced the feminist movement. Nevertheless, this woman seems unaware of her anachronistic behavior. In fact, I felt she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need. <br /> <br /> The fact that so many people were moved by the movie is amazing. I have admired Carl Franklin's films in the past, and I actually like Meryl Streep, but bothered what manipulating and lying film this is.
