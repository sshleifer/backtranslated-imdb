Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate's swing bachelor plan to hijack a casino, ala "Ocean's 11", and pin it on hell angels. Bad movement. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels AND number 69 and with the actual Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly pretty. Hell's Angels really deserve a better movie to be centered around them. Not this snoring party. Fortunately, this is one of the DVDs that contains comments from Joe Bob Briggs, so the pain of having to sit through it is very relieved. If you see it in any other way, let me recommend something to you. Does not !! <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Joe Bob Briggs comment; Conny Van Dykes's message to her fans (she has more than one?); Photo Gallery; Theatrical Trailer; and trailers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
