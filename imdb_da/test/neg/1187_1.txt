This review took longer to write than I took to watch this movie. It's just pretty bad. The reason is horrible compared to TV shows. It's flat, unfunny and boring. It is clear that LoG ran out of ideas long before this movie was green. Viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop. <br/> Poor editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero dynamics, zilch chemistry. <br /> <br /> A movie that doesn't know what it is made without any love for a mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feels angry that so much money was wasted. <LoG was of course made an offer they could not refuse, or perhaps their egos simply got the better of them. It is a gloomy marketing push that might have been better when LoG was fresher and more inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop and do. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone is trying to convince me of the movie's finer points!
