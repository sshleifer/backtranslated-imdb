Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and chooses them one by one in twisted and disgusting. I thought I had seen it all until an unfortunate man here was crucified and then his head set on fire. Hildy is also the front, she takes a sparkling harpy and sews her mouth shut ... then she hangs her head in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! "Witchery" made me sick. That made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by otherwise competent people ... until the final. I must admit that I loved the end. It involves a boy and his toy recorder, which is the corner of Linda Blair and looks great. The scene lasts only about a minute, and the movie is over, but you know the old saying: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you for almost everything!"
