The two leaders, an Englishman and an Aussie, filming the history of an American civil war in Romania, do not have the slightest spark between them, are absolutely incredible as lovers and completely unsympathetic. There is no history, no characterization, almost nothing to keep the eyelids apart during this interminable drill fixture. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly disappointed, chews practically the fence posts, but at least she sees the embarrassed herself giving some comic relief. Nicole Kidman is a decade old for the role and has no idea what is going on. Jude Law's moron role could have been played just as well by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to hike the forest looking stupid while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show. Not that was because all the guest stars were completely unnecessary, as they did not carry the so-called plot of an iota. And as if all that wasn't enough, the author felt it necessary to throw some spinning, swirling, kung fu jumping out of horses. What was it about?
