No one will celebrate THE SQUALL for a good movie, but it is certainly a memorable one. Once you have taken Myrna Loy's performance as Nubi the hot-blooded gypsy girl, you will probably not forget the experience. When this film was made, the exotic beautiful Miss Loy was still cast as foreign vixens, often Asian and usually scary. She is definitely an eyeful here. It seems that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled. In most scenes, she is barefoot and has a little more than a skirt and a loose-fitting peasant blouse, while in a scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel. I suppose I focus on Miss Loy's appearance because she is by far the best, if not the only, reason to tune into this creaking antique and watch. You will certainly not be attracted to the dialogue, which is hopeless. In a typical passage, Nubi looks out the window at the trolley and grows poetically: "Always the gypsies they sing. Nice and sad. , they sing. "Poetic or what? Lovers of purple prose have a field day. However, I cannot wonder if, in her later years, she preferred not to remember her involvement in this project. Like so many early talkies, this was an adaptation of a recent Broadway success. The scene version opened at the 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and ran for over a year. The game provoked a famous episode involving the humorous and theater critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have a reluctance to sign that spoke in thick dialect or pidgin English. According to a very repeated anecdote, Benchley quarrels uncomfortably through the opening part of this show. The Spanish village setting (moved to a village in Hungary for the film for some reason) gave the actors the opportunity to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience reached its limit when in a family dinner sequence a doorstep open and actress dressed as a gypsy girl dotted into the living room and shouted "Help! Help! He cuddles me!" She then threw herself at the household mistress and exclaimed "Me Nubi! My Good Girl! I Stay Here!" At that time, Mr. Benchley and announced to his companion, "Me Bobby. Me bad boy. I go now" and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The movie version contains many examples of accidental humor, but never comes close to Benchley's level. The melodramatic plot relates to the Lajos family: father Joseph, mother Maria and son Paul, a student at the nearby college. We will consider this wealthy family "upper middle class" as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy carriage enters the village and their home is invaded by ja nubi the nubile gypsy girl. She comes to their door during the storm of the titles - symbolizing stormy emotions, I avoid. The girl flies a violent relationship and begs for the sanctuary. After considering the case, Lajo's family accepts to hide her from her angry anger, which appears shortly afterwards, but turns away. Nubi becomes a servant in the household. Love motivates the family's decision to take her in, but soon the pretty, little, nothing Nubi has paid them back by seducing any bodily man nearby, starting with Lajos servant Peter and then working his way up to son Paul. Nubi breaks Paul's relationship with his fiance Irma (played by Loretta Young, still a teenager), causes him to flunk out of school and asks him to buy his jewelry by stealing the savings from the family girl Lena (ZaSu Pitts). Lena for her side still cares for the loss of her own fianc√© Peter, seduced and cast aside by Nubi as she turned her attention to Paul. Ultimately, Nubi sets her sights on Father Family's Joseph, and I assume that if the maturity was longer, she would also have gone after Uncle Dani, Maria, the village priest, and God knows who else. <br /> <br /> I think it goes without saying that a scenario like this can easily be parodyed, but during its first half THE SQUALL nevertheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime carpet: we see hypnotized en Bad Girl works her spelling on the men-people and destroys as an irresistible force in nature (almost like a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But as the plot machines paint on the camp, it is fun. In the later stages, Nubi is underlined and the focus shifts to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while, these people become a true feature. The son behaves like an absolute heel, but the parents never recognize this or face their own shortcomings; All we are told is Nubi's fault, it's not a good tramp. <br /> <br /> The men in the throw are boring. Apart from Miss Loy, the only actress who can handle performing in talkies, ZaSu Pitts, is amazing as usual. The mother of Lajo's household is played by Alice Joyce, a long-standing silent star who was out of her element with talking roles and who resigned shortly after that. Loretta Young's fresh taste gives a nice contrast to Nubi's dark allure, but her line-up is so awkward that it is a bit of love. No, there is only one reason to see this flick, and that is Nubi himself. I can't think of another actress who could have played this stupid role and managed to get out too. However, I am not an objective observer. I have a desperate fall in love with Myrna Loy and want to see her in something, even THE SQUALL.
