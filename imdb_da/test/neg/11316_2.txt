Leslie Nielsen is usually a person whose movies I really like (even critically panned flicks like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I slam "Mr. Magoo" should show that it is a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen as the myopic title character, something is planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems that Nielsen's combo and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Han's films) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; It seems that they just have people to do something, and there is no real humor here. <br /> <br /> So the original cartoon with Jim Backus, who gave the voice, was worth seeing so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better so there is no need to waste your time on this. Also Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer starring; They will probably not stress this junk in their careers.
