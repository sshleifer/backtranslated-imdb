Because of being inadequate. Somehow I just remained a little interested, but was it because I really wanted to know what the "secret" was (which I should say is pretty damn obvious) or because I hoped Scarlett Johansson would put on a more sexy outfit? This film is poor and it is more a disgrace to all the lonely, alcoholic southern literature professors out there. Travolta wants his Oscar so bad that he is willing to cry sharply in the bathroom after walking blood. Sorry, buddy. . .you were more credible is "stay alive". Not everyone can draw a Peter Fonda in "Ulees Gold." If you want the equivalent of brave gentleman Oscar, you actually have to act. . . Not just pout on the screen. Stop this instructor before he / she (name is vague on sex) again!
