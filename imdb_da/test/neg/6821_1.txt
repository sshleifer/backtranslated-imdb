Sorry, sorry, sorry. nice, very nice production, very nice actors, also fun. But this type of movie with a dog (Rex German, Gery-Jerry American) with a private detective, with a real nice woman ?????????????????????? ??? Hi producer, how many movies do we have out there with the same plot ?????????? What do you have on your mind when making scenes like a dog that has a pupu. Or any king of the dog's activities ????? Micro chips that can make you rich? Micro chips of the wort and wealth? There are three master chips, wow? And the creator of the chips can't make the same chips again? Hey, wake up. can give us something smarter than that? Best, D
