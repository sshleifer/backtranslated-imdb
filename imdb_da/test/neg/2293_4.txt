A Swedish splatter movie? Has the world been crazy? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but it is still not a common sight these days with Swedish gore flicks. The B-film industry in Sweden seems to have problems these days, long gone the golden days of "Space Invasion in Lapland". And this movie seems to have some problems alone: ​​it's just too much to talk about, it still manages to be a bit entertaining mainly for the good FX, which is great for a b movie. The script and most of the play is still pretty bad, but it is actually not so much, it must be a gore flick and no more, this is where it goes a little wrong for some reason. There is simply not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Every person who knows Gert Fylking will have a good laugh over his role as sgt. though. I almost laughed my ass out. It's really fun bad. <br /> <br /> Besides the good parts I have mentioned, there is really nothing else to recommend here unless you are hungry for Swedish B-movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
