What one threw ... and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it, you would expect little quality. However, the movie is a big mess with an unlikely story that cannot stop twisting and turning into it. Yes, I think they thought they were really smart about it all. <br /> <br /> The story is not only messy and unlikely, nor is it really terrible. It uses elements from past and much better poker-based movies. But for me it was really the many pointless twist and turned in the movie that did it. It made the story so unlikely that one could see. In addition, the script remains filled with many gaps stupid poker game errors and things that just don't make a horrible lot of reason. Why would anyone over all things play against a card player known as the best cheats in the game. It's about the movie and builds up, but it has never been very reasonable for me. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the movie has a great cast, it still feels as though most actors were displeased in their roles. I don't know what it's about Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor, but in most roles he plays he always plays out of place. Maybe it's his appearance I don't know. This was basically the reason why he was replaced in "The Lord of the Rings: The Ring Fellowship". Also Thandie Newton is not very good and actually quite annoying in her 'strong' female role. And what was the intention of having Melanie Griffith in this? Oh, I think I could go on with the film's casting and could even complain a little more about too limited screening time, as the Jamie Foxx character gets, but I think you get my point now. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is just not much of an original author / director, nor does he handle his own material very well. Scenes often feel disjointed, it tries to put too many characters and everything about the film is low and somehow predictable. In addition, the movie contains some bad edits at times, which also does not help make this movie a uniform whole. The movie was also a big office bomb and no wonder that Damian Nieman hasn't made a movie ever since. <br /> <br /> Too big a mess to make you enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
