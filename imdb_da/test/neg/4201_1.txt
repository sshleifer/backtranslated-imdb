This is definitely one of the best Kung Fu movies in the history of the cinema. The play is really well done (which is not often the case for this type of movie), and you can see that Chuck (in one of his first roles) is a great actor. The final battle with the sheriff's deputy in the bullfighting is a masterpiece!
