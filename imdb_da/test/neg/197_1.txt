I was a hippie age 22 in 1965, have seen the game 5 times, have 2 versions of the music, and have read the script many times. Perhaps taken as a separate thing, the movie is ok, but as a passing piece it is terrible. <br /> <br /> First, the good. The songs sang well, and the production values ​​are pretty good. The gay consequences of the Black Boys, the White Boys are cute. The Claude / Berger contact was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes in it are inherent, provided the basic spirit of it is preserved. <br /> <br /> But the basic spirit became very distorted. It seemed that all the desired producers had to sing certain songs and fit the story to them, no matter what the original purpose of the game was. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheil's parent party (it's hard to believe she smiled while her parents were injured) and stole cars several times. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert, where he would certainly tan hard, probably be busted in rank and could probably die on the lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it nice to break his son's heart as he shouted at his ex. This is not what hippies were like, not what the play described, and is directly opposite a love generation. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie begging for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not to pray of it. <br /> <br /> After Berger is thrown into jail to destroy Sheila's party and Claude offers to ask for something, Berger insists on being bailed instead, without any better plan to make the rest, hitting Sheila's parents hits his own mom. <br /> <br /> "Stay in" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted in silly brides floating around. Although this is part of his journey, it destroys a beautiful song. I know they are contrasting "floating in space" with the army. But again it destroys a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude are thinly dipping, Berger steals their clothes and laughs "it was fun man" even after he could see both, was very annoyed. So a little later, Berger does a thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in a beautiful SF place with the stars twinkling, perhaps working into an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings it in the burning sun that goes down the road in a convertible (of course stolen). <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the movie in 1979 and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to make a fairly close adoption of the show, but it is not.
