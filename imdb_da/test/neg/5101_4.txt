This is the 1990 TV show, not the 1979 movie. It appears to be three episodes in total under 90 minutes. To see it, I thought it was one of the movie versions, and I immediately noticed it had a TV show Feel to it. I didn't care too much about it. I just felt that the story was not there and there was not much in the way of excitement or drama. I'm looking at the time that's gone on my DVD player often, as I was really sorry. I also thought that part of the dialogue was to say it politely and not well. Plus, I thought the play left a lot to be desired. But it's just me, it's good clean, healthy family entertainment. It is certainly not insulting here. Kids will probably enjoy it. For me, The Black Stallion is 4/10
