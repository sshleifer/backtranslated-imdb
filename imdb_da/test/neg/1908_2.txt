All I have to say is a word ... SUCKS !!!!. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in it and he's cool. Should have beaten the Klein's fired ass ... stupid stupid and brain free. At the end of this movie you can't stand Klein, and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.
