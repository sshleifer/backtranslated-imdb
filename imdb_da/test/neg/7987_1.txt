We see Thomas Edison, with a glowing smile on his face, trying to electrocute a 5-ton living creature. Eventually, he became successful, and then the first animal film was born, wisely disguised as a great performance in technology. This is scientific arrogance at worst, folks. It stands up with the doctor who beheaded a monkey just to prove he could keep his cut head alive for 22 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, that is the absurd excuse that the elephant was convicted of "murder" and sentenced to death and that this was a just and human "execution". For all the people who are satisfied with this sophistication, please form a line to the right of me. I'll give you all a big collective Three Stooges flap over your head. <br /> <br /> See "The Advocate" (1993), a movie based on the true story of a murder attempt by a pig in Mideval France. 500 years later, people are still a bunch of morons I see. <br /> <br /> What's next? We arrest birds to steal our blueberries? Arrest dot bushes for attack and battery? Thomas Edison, I hope you have a big fat worm that scans your eye contact right now. Oh wait, it would be a violation, wouldn't it? laugh out loud
