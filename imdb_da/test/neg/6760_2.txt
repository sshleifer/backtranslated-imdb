This movie is the standard goofy sci-fi fare from the 50s. In his embrace, he manages to get hold of a foreign invasion without producing foreigners himself. But come on, if foreigners needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? Why wouldn't they just suck it out of a STAR!?!? The only credible cause of the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on the Earth's society, not just the only energy collection. Nothing is so intimate; Kronos may have been built of a superior race, but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end, which the scientist's heroes are planning for Kronos, is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. It is similar to the "reverse polarity" gambit that has been used so much in bad scifi, it has become a joke in itself. Make and see, this causes our unwanted visitors to release their total energy. No one in power seems to care about the effect the release of the very energy (which at the end of the film includes the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. And unfortunately, when the movie ends, the surroundings are suburban of Los Angeles. Oops!
