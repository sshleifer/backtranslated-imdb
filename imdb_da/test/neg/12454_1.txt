This movie has recently been removed by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered racy in its time, and it may have made money, but even the most deaf-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to pass through this boy. There are many 1950s film musicals that can withstand the test of time, although it is dated by current standards, but can still be enjoyed due to good music or dance or a fun plot. However, the "French line" does not fail in all these aspects. It doesn't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she got miserable vocal material. The whole cast is knocked down by a boring, tired plot and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth recording and jumping to just the musical tracks - they are crooked.
