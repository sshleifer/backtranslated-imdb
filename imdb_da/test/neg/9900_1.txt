This for TV movie is about all the clich√©s you can bring to a disaster movie. The only problem is that it is not very well done. My brain is still offended by the scenes where Brian Dennehy apparently looks at a computer screen that looks at weather pattern data, and displays on the screen are stock footage scenes of weather unrest all weather channels advertising. Why would looking at local news images of a washed out side street provide insight into global weather patterns? You have me. <br /> <br /> Also, transparent through the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects you witness. Look for the semi-truck and the plane that look like they were reproduced on a Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All foreshadowing in this "movie" is made with a sledge's subtlety, the dialogue is forced and I can Don't think of a sympathetic character that I will survive in the second half. The person I hate most is the stupid wife who is man is cheating. Perhaps if she raised a finger at any time during the show instead of being a helpless woman standing on the same 10 square feet of the kitchen, her husband would not sleep with the PR rope for a rival energy company. She is so helpless, I actually want to put her out of her and my misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
