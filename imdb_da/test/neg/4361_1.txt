...the first? Killjoy 1. But here's the review of Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, so beware readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my. Oh, my, mine, mine. I start by telling you that I had no hope at least that this movie would be good. Given that Killjoy (the first movie) is undoubtedly the worst movie ever made, the successor did not have much promise. <br /> <br /> As expected, it did not deliver. <br /> <br /> Deaths were even lamer than in the first movie. There was absolutely no eye candy at all, and every prop looked so fake that I wouldn't be surprised if they had a preschool doing them. Look, I don't even know where to start. Hm, first, the film was not even feature length. It was only an hour and eight minutes long (68 min), but again it was early to finish it. This is actually the only reason why this movie was not as bad as the first because the first one was longer. Normally, I don't give spoilers in reviews, but since I don't want any of you going through the torture to see this waste of movies, I will ruin myself. Not that there is much to destroy. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY IS PUSSIEST KILLER EVER. It takes explosions, firebombs, weapons, etc. To kill all the normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A F *** IN NO GLASS OF WATER. No lie. Eventually a girl took a cup of water and threw the water on Killy's face. Then, Killjoy started screaming, and they tried to make it look as if his face was melting by putting dried rubber cement on his forehead. Then he lay there and the people went to bed. <br /> <br /> Now let's beat the actor. Very terrible. Not even a person was credible at least. I don't even know what to say except it looks like they've just hired a few hobos living on the street to shop in this movie. I honestly doubt they used more than $ 100 in total to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of it took place in the forest, which would not have cost them anything to film. The actors did not give any effort, so it is obvious that they probably "worked" for free. They did not have any special effects or good props, and they probably used ketchup for the blood. Hell, who am I doing You probably didn't even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A movie can be made with a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> For Bob's sake, they couldn't even hire a policeman. In the end, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says "Where is he?" and the biggest woman answers, "He's gone." So suddenly a fat fat guy with scar on his face jumps out of nothing with a cell phone that says "You have a phone call." The girl replies and says "Oh, hi mother!" and smiling. Then the cool, good guy goes together to reveal that it is a police officer. However, he has khaki pants, and a regular button up green shirt, with a lame badge on the front of his pocket. Hell, it was probably the badge that the director got when he was in 3rd grade security patrol. Then they all entered a tan blazer and drove away as credits rolled. They couldn't even get a police cruiser so they just got a tan blazer. F ** can 'lame. Killjoy didn't even have the ice car he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is undoubtedly the most flamboyant gay slasher EVER. If there was a slasher who had hot pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag, he would still not be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy is also not fun (and believe me he was trying to be). The only good thing about this movie is an extremely limping threat given by one of the criminals. Someone is commenting on a boy not to pass the third grade that the boy responds to, "I'll show you third grade!" in a threatening way. It must be the absolute worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show you third grade!" <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't even work on a "so bad, good" level. It's bad. Unless you did something bad and you feel so guilty of punishing you seriously, DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> Just remember; If a flaming gay clown with a big black afro tries to kill you with gay jokes (and try to kill you at the same time), just throw some water on him. The case is closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: .1 out of 10
