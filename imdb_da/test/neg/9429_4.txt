If good intentions made a movie great, then this movie can be one of the greatest movies ever made. The movie has great actors, a master leader, an important theme - at least an important theme, undertone of the fifties existential world powers, air scenes that should have excited both the senses and the imagination and the signs of which one must deeply care. It's about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way. Not ten years after the movie, I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at the university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have a sense of humor. One had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a broth. I wonder if any of them died in Vietnam. I imagine they were flying missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie fails. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling and celebration of the patriotism itself, which emphasizes the narrative. No actress has been worse used on June Allison in this movie. Her Susan Holland is a woman whom one would escape, not embrace. Colleague James Stewart (as a colonel) does a good job at this role as Lt. Col (and later coal.) Dutch Netherlands. But the most interesting thing he does in the role is to bite into a sandwich. I'm not making fun. Stewart was good at biting sandwiches as he did in the Saint Louis spirit. <br /> <br /> You can think of Ted Williams, but I don't do that when I see Mr. Steward in the role. I think of William Holden as Lt. Harry Brubaker in The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr Stewart, who is wasted in this movie. Plays from a B-36 resemble outtakes from airline advertising. Although beautiful, the airshots are everyday. Currently, they may have impressed the viewers. The crash in Greenland involves unexciting modeling You expect the result to be good. Undertone - the subtitle - for the movie matches the stage that Air Force crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the Air Force used to do its business - good business like any other business. One imagines how a La Nouvelle Vague director can explore this theme and then begins to think about how a fantasy person might have filmed this movie. Small moments are missing out. When the crew returned from long missions, the crew members got a shot of scotch and a massage before describing the mission. Shows what could have helped. <br /> <br /> Banality was the image that the Air Force wanted, and Mr. Husband accepted brass. Maybe the movie works, but not for me. I care when I watch the movie because I think we all, director, actors, crew, viewers and members of armed services could have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here. I don't think this movie should be Dr. Strangelove or 2001, both of which have that pressure, but it had potential never realized. But I enjoy seeing it. I am thinking of the airlines on their long missions and ground herds in isolated places. There is a sense of honor celebrated here and I celebrate that honor. <br /> <br /> I understand why people praising this movie here and elsewhere appreciate it. If there were no intentional errors, it would get a 10 from me. <br /> <br />.
