The Hollywood movie industry is the craziest in the world. It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinventing again and again. Take superheroes for example, for every X-Man and Spiderman there is Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring, which was pitch-perfect (mainly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of scary women-based horrors, for example. Ring 2, Eye, Dark Water (which was fine but meaningless) and angry. <br /> <br /> The first Grudge wasn't bad. It was scary off the road, which is what one might expect from it. Plus, the plot had some brains to mix stories. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous one; This could be a good thing, but hey, what boy men in black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire manuscript and just change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> <br /> Tired scares, bad trades (except Amber Tamblyn) and clich√©s everywhere. Three stories take place at different places and times. There's Aubrey (Tamblyn) examining what drove her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel), taken by colleagues to visit the house, where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; And finally, an American family witnessing strange things happening at the apartment next door. Happy to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> Chills are out there, a girl alone in the cupboards, one who should not enter a house, others dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill and kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't it seem like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yes day after day it will be easier to keep an angry ... against Hollywood plays.
