"Heaven Can Wait" is a crushing bore and a candy-coated, misogynist lie. I can't imagine anyone but movie studios sitting through it today. Don Ameche is in almost every scene, and while he has a fluffy voice that undoubtedly contributes to his successful career on radio, he doesn't have the charisma to carry this movie. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henriks sexual incontinence adorable and entertaining, and then he leads Ameche to play it as gentle as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on gentleness results in a protagonist who is both deadly boring and completely icky. You wouldn't want to spend any time with this man; he wanted to put you to bed. You wouldn't leave him alone with your daughter, regardless of age. Something scary would happen. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance is quite boring. The scene after scene consists of static, overly lit, diorama-style shots of fastidiously dressed Gilded Age stuffed shirts and bustles lounging in overly bustling, Victorian parlors. There are so many ruffles and frills and curls, so very purple and sky blue and pink, you need Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it presents the hatred with a candy coating and a cute little bow on the top. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is ill. In one of the film's most hateful scenes, an older woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
