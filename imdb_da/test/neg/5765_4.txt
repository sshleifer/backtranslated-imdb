This is an embarrassing nth rehashing of the same plot in the next pile of idiots-young-adult-in-danger-because-the-idiots slasher movies in the early millennium: this time we get the story of a crazy mine coming back from the dead to regain his gold from the hands of the usurp. We have almost no excitement, almost no dear meat (although the girls are very warm, only one of them shows her bare ass for a few seconds), the usual bunch of sunset boulevard horror stars in cameo roles (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), lots of fake blood, only the insane mining stir up like a zombie is cool enough to leave you stuck - not exactly - to the screen to the end. Don't waste your time if you're not a completist.
