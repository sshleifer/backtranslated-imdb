Blackwater Valley Exorcism is located in a small town ranch where the teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around the deck of the dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch and are very concerned about their daughter, recently she has not been herself and is considered a danger to herself and others. Ranch hand and former pastor Miguel (Del Zamora) recognize Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession, and when she begins to speak old Latin in a strange voice, he is convinced of it. Blanche calls pastor Jacob (Cameron Daddo), who is her second daughter Claire's (Madison Taylor) ex man to see Isabelle, confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the job of performing exorcism, which hopefully will banish the demon in Isabelle & an innocent girl free . .. Directed by Ethan Wiley I sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over and over again, why am I doing it. Why do I continue to sit through all those horrible low budget horror movies that look like they were shot on a camcorder? Rights do it honestly, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete and completely incomparable rip-off of The Exorcist (1973) and you literally cross the big plot points as they two share. There is the obsessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny and suggests inappropriate things, the demon who uses former misdemeanor's against others, the worried parents, the way the obsessed girl is cut off by the doctor, the pastor with a troubled past and the occupied girl is, among other things, tied to her bed. I guess where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (than it's totally crap), it tries to give all the character's screen time and tries to cross over how the situation affects them, but it's so poorly written and acted it just ends with to become boring. The movie starts with Isabelle already possessed, so we never knew what she was like a normal person, so we never really care about her or what happens to her either, the rest of the character is poorly written and flabby. At times, I wondered if the Blackwater Valley exorcism was a ghost, a silly scene, where a veterinarian is trying to calm the occupied Isabelle with the horse's tranquilizers & after he says she needs a "little dot" he comes into her room with a big needle hidden behind his back! There are a couple of scenes where people are stopped accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The movie has an uneven tone due to the fact that it goes between stupid spoof and serious horror drama, or so did it in my opinion. <br /> <br /> According to a part of the pre-opening text, Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on 'Current Events', indeed real 1973 events that happened in a movie called The Exorcist ... This piece of text is also called that the exorcism scenes were monitored by a true priest. There is not even a decent deal or exploitation to experience things that are a scene with a cutter arm that is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a cross and it is about it. There is surprisingly no bad language in it, even though the demon is trying to be offensive. I can imagine the only reason why Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of a very short scene where a few breasts are seen. A pair of naked female breasts is not worth looking at this or the money you might spend on it. There are zero scares, no atmosphere and a truly amateur feeling for the whole movie too. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 1,000,000, I have to say that I wonder where all the money went, the movie looks ugly & cheap all the way through. There are no special effects to talk about & the production values ​​are bottom-up. The action is very bad from all involved, re-favorites Jeffrey Combs is approaching top billing during the opening circles, but has nothing more than a cameo in what corresponds to about five minutes of screen time. Even though he must have feared how bad this should be, he has hidden behind a mustache and a terrible accent that he is better than this. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without everything that made the movie such a classic, and decision makers are still thirty five years late. A total turkey from start to finish.
