I had the fun chance to see this at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 four years ago. I have to admit that it wasn't as badly done as some other science fiction / horror movies of the time. The reason was about an astronaut coming back to earth with alien embryos inside him. Now the plot is quite strange, good if you can call it a plot yourself. (See a room program run out of a building, and an old pickup truck is drop-dead funny!) I admit it was terrible at today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I can see myself for 43 years ago to see and be charmed by this movie. It is not even close to the invasion of the men of Neptune, Manos: fateful or future war. <br /> <br />
