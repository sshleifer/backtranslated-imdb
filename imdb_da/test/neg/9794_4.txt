After his widow's death in a horsing accident, young Tom Burlinson (like Jim Craig) is back to manage his Australian "Snowy River" farm, with only the wizened-bone prospector Kirk Douglas (as Spur) to help. Times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for Mr. Douglas' wealthy, silver-haired embroidery "Mr. Harrison" (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a lot of work comes up, the silver-haired (older?) Douglas feels that Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go with; Burlinson stays behind and falls in love with boss's daughter Sigrid Thornton (like Jessica Harrison). The least satisfying aspect of director George Miller's "The Man from Snowy River" is a weak storyline. Be aware that "Jessica is lost" sequence of events. The father is lost in one of the "freak" storms as he runs away. Her worried father transforms a lot of pounded men to find her after predicting bad weather. Damsel "Jessica" rolls herself on the edge of a comfortably protruding rock. Father and the suddenly sober men do not control Burlinson's farm. Hero Burlinson discovers girls. After building a fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> "Romance" is played too innocently for just as obviously an attracted man and woman as Burlinson and Mrs Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark story" that is revealed before a mystery of the matter arises. The main attraction here is the Australian nature. **** Man from Snowy River (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
