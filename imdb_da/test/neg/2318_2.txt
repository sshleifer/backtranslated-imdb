Although I'm sure the idea looked good on paper and it appealed to me when I first heard about it, this movie often suffers and falls flat, and when I see it, I just want to end it. The book's beginning and end of the film about Lou, who has to babysit a troublemaker, is optimized at best, though I found the high cop part to be humorous. But I found a little laugh at the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown together for these two great comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical and the series of "Wizard of Oz" rip-off (with the songs and black and white for color format). I would not recommend this movie to anyone but die-hard A&C fanatics. Everyone else will be disappointed and they have many better movies.
