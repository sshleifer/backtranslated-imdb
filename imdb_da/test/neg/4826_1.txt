I don't know how people can see this - the only ones who enjoy watching this are those who don't have feelings and feelings and enjoy watching people die, houses burn down, car crashes, babies die and cast members are killed of every week. It's the most absurd thing on television, and I still don't know how it draws on the ratings. It's so depressing. I can imagine the authors sitting and saying, "Who should we kill next week so" or "whose house should we torch in a month?" It is the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on television at the moment, and I can't understand people's motives for seeing this depressing pile of crap anymore
