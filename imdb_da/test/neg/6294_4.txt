as I am sure other people have said that this guy is not a very worthy subject. Certainly, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it is fun to hear him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he is in giving himself an unworthy mystery. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that he is a moron racist using weak methods to try to disprove the mountain with evidence of health, and as such he must be forgotten over time. but Morris is in love with any kind of curiosity that I would not normally mistake him for.
