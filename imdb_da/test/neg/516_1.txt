You have to watch this movie, it's a great footnote in the film's history. When this film was made, the American film industry reached the bottom of suction. Watch this movie, laugh, and feel sorry for yourself to waste the last 2 hours of your life. It's the worst play I've seen and even worse management. The villains laugh at being taken from a clown circus, and if those who made "Scary Movie" want to make a parody of superhero movies, they only have to take the script from this movie and make a remake called Black Scorpion III: The Threat Really really bad movies that somehow manage to lure the production companies into a suicide time.
