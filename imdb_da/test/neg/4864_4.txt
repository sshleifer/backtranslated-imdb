I have rarely seen an action / excitement movie that was so boring. None of the action scenes are exciting, the story is nothing special, and with the exception of a few actors, the spectacle is bad. Charlie Sheen (Plato, Major League) stars as White House Chief of Staff, getting themselves in the midst of a conspiracy wishing him and more people died. Donald Sutherland plays a friend, he tells everything he can and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is ok as the star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a poor performance. With a bad movie I actually like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very cheesy end with some almost ridiculous things.
