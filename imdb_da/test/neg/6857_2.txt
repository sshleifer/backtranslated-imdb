I don't really know why, but I saw it with quite a feeling. Unfortunately, it was incorrectly placed. First, it is not scary, it does not scare and (unless it was even worse than I gave it credit - which is possible) not trying to. It's a trashy comedy, and the fact I smiled once means I gave it a 2 not a 1. This movie rips off Gremlins in a really special way, I can't claim I've ever seen a movie that use themselves more. Very, very bad - avoid.
