The 80's veiled (glam) rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a little 'cool' today is that it is a long time ago so we can laugh at its sweetness. Too bad Rock Star has no laughs as it should be one of the most boring movies of recent years. Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he is thrown out of the band at the same time, the real Steel Dragon singer is also kicked and he becomes the next leading singer. You already know how it will end at the time with Chris losing it with sex, drugs and R&R and forgetting his long-term wife / manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There is way too much (boring) music in this standard formal excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all costs. See it (over-rated but still more fun) Almost Famous instead of, or even better, a movie about real people playing real music with real feelings. What you do. What a stink. 10.2.
