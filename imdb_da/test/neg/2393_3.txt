Oddball black comedy romance with a great cast and a less than stellar script. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character 'Betty', a woman trapped in a love marriage with a man who obviously has an affair with his beautiful blonde secretary. Guess who plays this minor role, yup! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") has to crush this project before his superstar status was assured with the burst thriller "The Ring." On the male side of the cast list, there is the violently misunderstood Alfred Molina ("Frida") an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his wishes for 'Betty', who has been sleeping for decades. Perhaps Miramax hopes Molina's trip in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2" can interest this little trinket belonging to the DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> But the prize for the wildest grateful performance goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch Me If You Can"), which goes all over the top as a "modern" undertaker with his Vegas-style funeral in a small provincial town. His character must have fallen into the village because there is no reason to exist in this script. <br /> <br /> That said, if you'd like to see some top actors get involved in some low-knuckle humor then it's here for you and if it's not your cup-of-tea, try renting " Harold and Maude ", the ultimate fun movie still fun today.
