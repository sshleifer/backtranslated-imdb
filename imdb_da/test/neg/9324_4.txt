I found Dominion to be a miserable attempt to continue the success of history. The original film was a story of evil and how it can infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Schrader's version is missing out on evil. Viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of fear, fear or even fornication. Harlin's version apparently gives evil, shows violations of the whole of the church, and builds a convincing story that is plausible, given Far Merrin's background. Schrader's story leaves you wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not induce viewers' emotions to empathize with Father Merrin and leaves the viewer wondering why he was worried at first. Everyone interested in seeing a successor living up to the original should see Exorcist: The Beginning.
