Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors in the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7 and American Beauty, you expect more and more of him. Therefore, Ordinary Decent Criminal is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most artificial criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next heist becomes an obsession when his partners begin to question Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, even if that's all he does when he doesn't play good father at home. <br /> <br /> I think it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details that unfortunately turn out to be the "essence" of the movie. I gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and .... well, parodies are always fun, no matter what they spoof or how they do it. So it was not a complete parody of that purpose. It's just another movie that desperately tries to be fun and fails. Unlike some of his "colleagues", ordinary decent criminals depend too much on history development and logical continuity, forgetting what is the main reason the viewer has chosen this kind of movie - to be entertained. This is definitely not entertainment. It contains one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the introduction of Mikas two women. I don't know if it's a kind of thoughtless metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chickens are sisters. Remember, Spacey's character has kids. <br /> <br /> Regular Decent Criminal is complex and confusing. You are not waiting for a fun scene. Instead, you follow the dialogue carefully because there is a great opportunity to lose yourself in the dull, pale universe, the movie has inhabited. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder, in what state he has been, signing for that movie. It's not miscasting, but something much worse. An insult to his work in American Beauty, released a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is sometimes almost pathetic. The only cure for this is thinking of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. <br /> <br /> The author, Gerrard Stembridge, should definitely reconsider his screenwriting skills and be more objective this time around. Because the dialogue is very weak and the scenes are often meaningless. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> Common Decent Criminal is a really bad crime comedy that doesn't deserve your attention.
