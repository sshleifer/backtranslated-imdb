Writer director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless topic - friendship - making it a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine filmography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is ridiculous. "Teach me how to like" art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon) and it's about summarizing it. We learn nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil can be a fine actor, but not a minute we think he could be the scary egoist, the manuscript depends on who he is. Just as we hope the travesty is over, Leconte draws one of his usual cathartic third acts, the rapid progress of disaster damage. Like François beloved Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet in Costes' business partner Catherine, who looks and is sexy despite a big haircut accident.
