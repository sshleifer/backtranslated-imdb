This one is a real stinker. The story is just not up to most other TZ episodes. It's pretty boring, even though seeing Peter Falk as a Fidel Castro lookalike is fun. <br /> <br /> When the Twilight Zone was sent for an unannounced hour in my hometown, I would grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in a good entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it runs like this episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mother (another TZ fan like me) too. There were so many times that one of us would say to the other: "I was all about watching The Twilight Zone_ and guessing what episode was on? The Cuban dictator episode!" Of course some people like this episode as it gets a 6.7 rating ... how it happened, I have no idea - but it would in itself make a great Twilight Zone plot!
