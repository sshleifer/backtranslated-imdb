This movie is horrible. It creates characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an unpleasant little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story of faith, and this movie is a dark, ugly and unnecessarily scary movie about nothing. The animation is great, but the story has been destroyed by Hollywood. <Br /> The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the cashier's office, and maybe the producers will learn to stay away from a story that doesn't need any improvement. Hanks was overdone and I can't see why there could not have been other players' voices used.
