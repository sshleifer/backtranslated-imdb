This movie sucked completely! Don't even rent it! You will hate it! The reason did not make sense, the signs sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the stone anyway? If the girl penguin would only like him because he has a beautiful stone, then the relationship would not be based on love only on money! I didn't like this movie (Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins can't fly! Even if they think they can do it, they can't. P.S. I'm not who you think I am!
