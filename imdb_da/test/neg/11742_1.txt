Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shots, including some modern facets: a jellyfish and nudity from Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked, there is absolutely no need to watch this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better, and Van Sant fails to realize that the original shower scene is more frightening when hiding nudity and doing. Ask Janet Leigh about the one. The action is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.
