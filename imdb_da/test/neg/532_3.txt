This movie is a cyborg in itself: Half Nonsense / Half Lifetime Original Movie. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, this movie has only one purpose: to make you want you to have used the movie's duration in a dark room that strikes you in the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I didn't rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I explain why I rented it briefly). I'm not a big fan of Mrs Jolie, though I would say that her performance was amazing! Her blind stare and robotic actor really had me believe she was an android hooker. If someone has a clip of her in 'Inside the Actor's Studio' explains how she prepared for this role, then send it my way. I will make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against integrity. <br /> <br /> So what drove me to rent this movie? You'd think it was hoping to see Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the reason for this rental was solely on one of the pictures on the DVD cover; Jack Palance's face! Half of his face was robotic! When I saw it, I imagined that legions of "mansions" were slowly marching through a burning wasteland that was relaxing to people who were bad enough to resist. In my eye, every member of this unholy army of Palances had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that looked at people and saw only "meat". They should be the architect of Oblivion ... a cold, steep apocalypse ... a nightmare from which humanity would never awaken. It is a beautiful picture that I will cherish for the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the actual movie didn't live up to my expectations. No, there was only 'one' Jack Palance, and the only visible cybernetic improvements he had were placed on his leg. Unfortunately, these improvements did not improve. It's unless you count LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a superpower. At least their was a scene where Jack - laughing as a trigger-happy Alzheimer's patient - had to shoot hell out of some people. I waited for him to shout: "I'm sorry to pay too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, every outbreak of geriatric rage was few and far between. <br /> <br /> What the movie had an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man (Elias Koteas, also the bad man De Niro) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, aka Demon Spawn by John Voigt). Oh man, can the love between a Romo of Flesh and a Juliet of Silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! It can, if you follow Jack Palane's simple advice: "You must taste each other's TIME". Yes, I'm not sure what that means. But I'm sure I don't want Jack Palance to be the one explaining it to me. Surely he doesn't want him to show me! As an attempt, I suggest you ask your significant other if he / she thinks we have reached a level in our relationship where we can start to taste each other's TIME?
