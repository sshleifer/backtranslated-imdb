The biggest problem with "in the search for historical Jesus" is that there is very little searching for it at all. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and right into the 80s, which included interviews with "experts" and discussion of "science" and "facts" to make a case for whatever the movie's title so out to cash in on. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Historic Jesus" is really a little more than a three-dimensional dramatization of Christ's life. Unlike Shick-Sunn's superior "In search of Noah's Ark", which spends most of its running time discussing the possibility of the ark resting on the ground today and where it may be, this movie is basically the story if Jesus made no effort to prove or disprove his existence. The famous Turrins Shelf is mentioned, but a little bit more Detective work is given much Screen Time. For fans of these quasi-documentaries such as "Jupiter Menace" and "In Search of Bigfoot", etc., this movie does not offer much.
