This is the most scary movie ever made in Hollywood. It is a warning of how to take a European masterpiece and suck it off until it is a dry remember as an insect body on the window sill. Frightening because it reveals how the Hollywood world really works: ignorant money that commits dross. It makes me wonder how many good movies could fill my memory corridors if the Hollywood process hadn't smoothed them into a forgotten mediocrity. Cry for the murdered children! See Spoorloos or read the golden egg if you dare because they will come back to you forever in the inactive moments of life: as you walk along the street and you see a "missing" poster; in regular parking spaces when you hear the Tour De France on the radio; and especially when you think "what is the damage?" in wearing a sock with a hole in it on a plain day. <br /> <br /> If I could only give this a zero.
