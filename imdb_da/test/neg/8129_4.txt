Big (and we mean plus big size) baddie Sebastian Cabot is trying to land land farmers from their country to get the oil rights. When seafaring dies Sterling Haden's pop, how will the Hade stop the TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First, this is not a B-western. There are no singing cowboys, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie - you know, those who use immaterial actors to say "important things" and cover the general low-message tips in the hallway with interesting camera angles. <br /> <br /> The second is this movie, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would lead to the abolition of Trumbo's important declarations of justice in America, and the rather sick relationship between the supreme henchman and his girl is real low budget. The biggest problem that causes is that the play is really, really bad. Sterling Hade is decent enough in tough roles, but he is the last guy you want to play a sensitive Swedish sailor gone to find his happiness in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make a Sydney Greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot doesn't have the working chops for it. The guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the movie. He does nothing about it. <br /> <br /> Third, the script isn't really all that. Trumpets get some digging if the immigrant is not going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt city, and the people, when opposed to genuine repression, tend to come down again. This is a pretty stunned 1958 movie announcement - High Noon, Bad Day at Black Rock, Devil's Doorway - all westerners dealing with the wickedness of Western society with an eye on the evil of the 50s America. Trumbo, in '59, certainly had all the personal reasons to agree with these feelings, but he does nothing new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So given all the negatives, why does this movie get a 4? Mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the film. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is about fascinating.) And Trumbo, while a mediocre writer, while pursuing his political implications, is very good at creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when you are ready to go out from Indy movie boredom, dialogue or simple quirkiness will be exchanged, realizing that the guy who wrote the script was not just a hack. <br /> <br /> If you don't do it as a Drum or Western, give it a miss. Otherwise, try it. You like more than I did.
