How unfortunate, yet fortunately, that the two films about the cave hole - The Cave and The Descent - were to arrive much at the same time. Unfortunately for The Descent, its release in the UK on July 7 coincided with the very day of London's underground tube / metro terrorist cruelty that killed nearly 60 and injured hundreds - not a particularly good night / weekend to get out into the cinema, especially that watch a scary-as-sheesh movie about like-minded women trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic underground hole system. The two films have basically the same elements - half a dozen or so characters lost in a previously unexplored hole system, without anyone being aware that they are trapped down there. Lots of water, caves, danger ... so ultimately some vicious human or human derivative decided to swap them. Where the two are so different is that The Cave is unreal, absolutely incredible, more alien-esquire sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama. The comparatively minuscule budgeted British film (filmed in southern England, although located in the Appalachians) is five-par-of-pants scary, a heart-stopping shocker, so the stomach turns out that people are out of screenings early in shock. It paves the girls in an old order - you have no idea what to expect next - surely not her! The descent also shines naturally and makes it even more frightening, unlike the ridiculously enlightened Cave, which resembles a giant magical Santa's cave with space in cathedral size after space dazzling in brilliant blue light from ... who knows where while cavers torches are entirely is used for artistic illumination of the granite jaw heels (each more puppet-like than any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation). Great amounts of equipment are also worn, but despite this, the impossible-deep cast actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger, drama or something worth for a horror movie - it is strictly PG-rated. And in this case, the actors point in exactly the order everyone expects them to - I quickly wrote a list after introduction to each character, only to get Piper Perabo out of order. The Cave script is completely by-numbers, unlike Shakespeare, a space full of chimpanzees would eventually write it for a week ... Take a typical exchange between the 'good friend''s white and black wires; "How many times have we been in this situation before bud?" - "too many" (replies Morris Chesnut). I swear you could hear my suburban London audience gasp on openness. The scary thing about The Cave is that at the end there is a clear opening for the 'sequel' - 'The Cave 2: Overground' or whatever. Be scared, be very scared ... Or instead catch the Descent and be really scared, very very very scared. RR
