On this site I often lambasted the Americans not knowing how to write comedy BUT while they have never produced any of the quality of 'Fawlty Towers', 'Blackadder' or 'The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin' they have never (to my knowledge) done anything as bad as this: nadir for the British comedy. <br /> <br /> On my Richter scale of comic horror, it's just behind the really executable 'are you served' as the worst comedy show in English, with bad plays, annoying characters and humor that I grew out of before I left primary school. Unfortunately, it was part of a large crop of shows then accompanied by 'father's army', 'It's not Half Hot Mum' and 'Allo, Allo' who relied on ridiculous situations and known catch phrases to keep the audience "mored". <br /> <br /> Later, Michael Crawford showed that he is a talented performer, but personally, I'd rather be sentenced to a month to watch 'Rhoda' than endure a single episode of this drive, making Sham me to be British.
