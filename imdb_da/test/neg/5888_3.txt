I'm at a loss. This whole movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg movie for football. The camera cut, pace, everything so copied. I thought the topic was too serious for them to treat it as it was. Yes, we all know the south as football and beauty campaigns. Should we be flooded with it as the audience? I saw because of Lee and Jay. I expected young talents in the style of the Dead Poet Society or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely cut off by the film. You didn't get the signs. It was character-driven, but you didn't understand any of their motivation or their actions for the most part. The one child who is the mother is obsessed with being a football player. Why is he so quiet? What is his deal? Should we really have the scene with him "prove" his heterosexuality? Why should we take care? The film gave us insight into these children's lives and offered no pay-off for care. It just made no sense. <br /> <br /> And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know that's right, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their "imaginable" problems, darnit. We have nothing. We got a little blip at the end of the movie and told us that Mojo won the next year with 3rd stringer (Lee). Why didn't you follow that story? What should we get out of this one? The movie brought you together, but didn't bring you anywhere. I just felt that something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least, the two films brought you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a losing team that lost their star player early in the movie. The actor who played him was great. You were totally annoyed by him, which was supposed to, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why make sure we get his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the play-offs ... do we believe they are high school? These men looked like college seniors or professional plays in their 30s. Who did they try to wear? I know the other team was looking scary, but it went a little over the line. I liked the gritty element of those who negotiated with the black team, but how did it go into the overall theme of the movie. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and it is strange to me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was shown. It was just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee.
