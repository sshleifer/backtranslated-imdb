Like almost everyone else, I became aware of this turkey at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It is easily located as one of my favorite MST3K episodes all the time. I really couldn't imagine trying to watch this movie on my own though ......... it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe stars like Ator, a muscle-bound Fabio wannabe living in the time of hollow men. We viewer is asked to suspend our disbelief because he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete enema for about 5 minutes. Yeah right! There is also a pretty attractive actress (can't remember her name) wearing a hub-cap like a chest shield. Oh, and I can't forget the crazy Asian side-kick Thong. He had the easiest role in the film, as he did not express a word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without speaking ..... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The movie cannot be viewed in any way and should only be viewed in the correct MST3K format. If you see that version, you will laugh yourself stupid! <br /> <br /> "I'm HUGE !!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
