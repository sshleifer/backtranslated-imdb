Bone Eater is set in a small desert town in Alabama, where property developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) finances the construction of a large resort. Later one night, three of his workers dig Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) foundations in the desert when they discover what resembles a tomahawk, unfortunately for them, an ancient Indian demon called bone ether comes and kill them. Local Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon has Krantz breathed into his neck when the construction of his resort knocks down, Sheriff Evans must also deal with the bones demon, as it kills anyone coming over ... <br / > <br /> You know I consider myself a pretty big fan of the horror & sci-fi genre, I certainly don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else (unlike many here on IMDb ... ), but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' I've ever seen, and it stands up to a damn strong competition. As a horror and sci-fi fan, there are two names that, when involved in a movie that sends, move back in expectation of how bad it gets. The names are Jesus. I have no talent. Franco, who had nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski who managed the absolute disaster, Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad, Wynorski hid under the pseudonym Bob Robertson, when an instructor as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym, you know that the movie should be bad. Where do I even start? Bone Eater is simply the worst movie I've seen this year and is so bad, it's untrue, the story is horrible, the manuscript is sloppy. (Once Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him in the hospital, but when they meet there later, he has acted surprised and says 'what are you doing here?' At a time Sheriff Evans claims triumphantly that we are in the twentieth century & that old indian demons are nonsense, although we are actually in the twentieth century now there is a role when a woman tells in the flashback story, where three men awaken bone eater & it kills them, but since it killed all three of them, how did anyone know others about it, that it was sent down in the legend?) and sometimes it becomes more than a little embarrassing. The character is terrible clich√©s, the little town Sheriff that saves the day his daughter gets involved, adding a personal motivation, and as for the Indians, there is an old wise man, a young hot head who hates 'white man' and a young woman Who is the reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk. The movie is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is horrible, it is full of plot holes and lapses in any kind of logic, the set pieces are awful, there is no horror or gore or excitement or mystery & Bone Eater is Just the kind of movie that makes you lose the will to live. Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've seen for a while is just a selection of bones that are magically held together for a motorcycle jumping a big hole into a horrible CGI truck crashing over the edge of a rock, until a product is thrown to one side of the bone seam. When the knee joint gets a bit of speed, he gets a big horse to form from sand & dust & rides it! In principle, it's actually a pretty good idea, but it looks terrible and the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack! There is a pointless scene at the end when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) And it bleeds, but apart from that, there is not a single drop of blood in things when the bone lighter kills someone as they usually just disappear in a dust cloud. boring. The hilarious climatic clash between Sheriff Evans and the Ben Eater must be seen as being believed, Sheriff Evans becomes native to horseback, complete with tribal war paint on his face, while the bone spider also rides his dust horse and they have a kind of swirl competition that is too poor to describe correctly. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 700,000 Bone Eater filmed in a very bland, forgettable & flat way, there's no sense of style here at all. The majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight, and if you look at a decent telly, the desert landscape is pretty nice on occasion. There are several veteran 'well-known' actors who really slumber here, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the corresponding theme, but much better 'Creature Feature' Snakehead Terror (2004), William Katt will of course put his name to some shit so long as he gets paid, while ex Star Trek man Walter Koenig must be really desperate to agree on this. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a really awful 'Creature Feature', there really is not much more you can say about it other than steering it. The worst movie ever to appear on the Sci-Fi channel, and that doesn't matter?
