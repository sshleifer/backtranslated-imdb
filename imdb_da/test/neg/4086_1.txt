The only redeeming feature of this movie is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne I have never seen Steve Carell stretch too far as an actor, but it doesn't matter. He always plays his role perfectly. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman said, comedy must have internal consistency. You can have 4 men on the stage sitting in trash bins, and that's fine, but if you bring a fifty man to the stage that is not in trash bins, you must explain to the audience why he is not in trash bins. Why doesn't Evan accept his role as God's messenger? Why, when he accepts it, is he so deeply embarrassed about it? Why isn't anyone more impressed with the way animals follow Evan around (they are explained away by the unthinking doubts that "trained animals" might be from a circus). There is a terrible flood at the end, and most everyone we see hops on the ark and are saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; There is no post-disaster emotional atmosphere at the end. Instead, most of the congress has finally seen the light and is prosecuting the lonely uncorrected bad congressman for "profit". I must admit: I also liked the fish in the aquarium that responded to the presence of Evan.
