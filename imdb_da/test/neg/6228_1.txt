I have to say that there is a redeeming speck against this "movie". It firmly secures the bottom of the barrel. Now videographers know what to aim for when making a movie. Except I regret seeing this debacle. What shamelessly give up to make this "movie" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (it's real people, one hundred thousand dollars). This "movie" reminds me that the "Adult Video Awards" show where a group of "industrial prostitutes" stand up for a praise themselves, believing they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. Ironic then how I've seen blue movies with better acting, management and writing. I also found it fun that Executive Producer Justin Ament just had to be in "movies". He plays substitute Jake Barker. I'm sure his "acting" career has gone ... Ted Pfiffer, the author, has a role. He undoubtedly walked in the clich√© of glory he created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea has a major role in the film. You can remember her from Gus Van Sants' Elephant. Although I'm not sure she will write this movie on her CV. And I'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was used to make this movie, or people will see it. Along with 'Torque', 'Godsend' and 'Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow', one of the worst movies, IF NOT THE WORST MOVIE, 2004.
