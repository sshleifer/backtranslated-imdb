The Doll Master is an example of a miserable horror movie that has fallen somewhere in space with the two not so well-established genres, a horror movie and an emotional drama film. It looks like The Doll Master is trying very hard to be a very scary horror movie, but it fails. The doll's noise during movement is as taken from the kayak's quay in Ju-On, and the crawls are like sadako esquire. The kill dolls will remember you a sweet version of "Chucky". But compared to Child's Play, this movie is more excellent. But the story looks like nothing, the brilliant camera pictures and the sharpness of the play were taken away from the ground. <br /> <br /> Don't see this if you expect big shock.
