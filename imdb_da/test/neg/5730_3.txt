Red Sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Having made a couple of swords 'n' Turkish films (like Conan), he had moved to some more serious plays in films such as The Terminator and Commando, only to make a mystifying return to the sword's nasal series for this 1985 debacle. It's hard to figure out why he was bothered, as this is weaker than both Conan films in every imaginable department. This was supposed to have been the third Conan movie, but for some reason the emphasis was shifted to the premier female character, the titular redhead that left the bad old Arnold playing an incredibly boring entertainment role. Save a thought also to Director Richard Fleischer, who had given world classics such as 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his penultimate film - Fleischer has also taken a giant career step backwards. <br /> <br /> Eternal Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world, and she needs an invaluable and powerful talisman to do so. She and her brutal army storm are kept by priests and steal the talisman who massages the helpless clergymen as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery red-haired warrior who, after hearing his sister's death, swears revenge on the evil Gedren. Sonja rides across the country looking for Gedren's lair. Along the way she picks up traveling companions in the form of a boy prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. Initially, Sonja does not want Kalidor's help (Arnold Schwarzenegger), and instead prefers to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms up to him and accepts his help. <br /> <br /> Red Sonja is a staggeringly bad movie, the more so when you paint that it was made in 1985, when the sword's n-magic genre was close to its end. It seems so simplistic and amusing that one could easily celebrate it for an early example of its kind. The performances are poor on the whole, from Bergman's scandalous OTT villain to Reyes' incredibly annoyingly spoiled abruptly to Schwarzenegger's wooden and unenthusiastic hero. Nielsen is a little better than the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first lead - but she gets very badly from Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser's script. The movie is riddled with goofs, including a scene where Schwarzenegger is seen in close-up hacking down bad guys, but in a long shot in the same order there is no body in sight. Technically, it is also very imperfect, with sub-standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters. There are some compensations, like the pleasing music of Ennio Morricone (Morricone spent much of the 80s, giving good music to horrible movies, such as The Island, Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another compensation is Giuseppe Rotunno's lining of the sites - in fact much of the time it is a hell of a lot more pleasing to look at the lovely landscape than the actors are in the foreground! There were very few swords 'n' Turkish movies after Red Sonja, so in some ways it can go down in history as the movie that destroyed its own genre.
