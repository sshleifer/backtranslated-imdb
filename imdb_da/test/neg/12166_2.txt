Ok, I'm really in the king's thing, but it's just awful. The whole movie, I'm waiting for the protagonist to do something deep with his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst movies since something is better than watching a movie with advertising in it. but it takes the cake. I gave it a 2 and I would never recommend it to anyone.
