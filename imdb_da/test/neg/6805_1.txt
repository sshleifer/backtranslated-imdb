For anyone who is concerned about knowing about the real Diane Arbus, or who appreciates psychological truth, this film is unreasonable. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and restless person, but this film depicts her as completely self-centered and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her as bad and vague as she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma. The completely fictional relationship that is central to the movie is absolutely incredible, and Robert Downey is really annoying in his smirk-portrayal of someone who seems to believe he is superior to the rest of the world simply because of his suffering. The film shows this meeting as the source of Arbus' interest in "freaks", which is a truly banal explanation of the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. The mystery to me is why people in some talent and intelligence chose to be involved in this movie in some way.
