OK the box looks interesting, the opening has good music and its kind of original, so it's okay. But when the movie starts ... yes it's not my first video movie, I saw Ghost Lake, and its very similar to this movie except its worse here. The story was first interesting, but the whole movie looks like a movie shot by a bunch of college students, with special effects that I laugh, the blood looks like a mixture of red and white paint, the fire on the demon's face looks like it was done with a program I could buy from my local computer store. All the film is shot during the day (very nice for a movie that should be horror) and there are no gore (only 1 scene and it looks so homemade and not credible) and near no blood (it can be considered a good thing in considering the look of the blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. The story goes nowhere, it gives you the impression that it never starts, there is so much useless scene that is only done to give the film the average duration (when the demon is looking for the guy in the dogs for about 4 minutes ...) Everything for very slow things. Well, let's just say that this movie is a Z series and a very bad one. All cool ideas got lost and you get a cheesy movie. It all bored me for a long time, and I'm not the guy who bored me very easily with horror movies, man, I'm like they died and alone in the dark of Uwe Boll, and you probably know the name to be one of The worst instructors but here it looks too much like some guys who want to make a movie for fun. Plus for us French speaking (hard I understand English, I prefer to watch movies in my native language) there is the usual video error bad translation. In normal film you can hardly see it not the actor speaks (you have to check on lips etc.) Here you just listen to it and you know it. Very cheesy
