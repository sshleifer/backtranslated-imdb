Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so miserable that it actually gets fun. The director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued the B-series film. The stupid bimbo (nice rack) gets caught again and again by the wicked, the main crook smirky and reveals his plots before they happen, so they can be destroyed and which of course bullied / killed the hero's father in an unclear past, a side scoop in the policeman's person - Small, bald, and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) returns to his baseball cap rimback back, etc. The end of the movie really tops it. After the top villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high, they leave the building. Which, from the outside, sees only three stories high and much like your regular town hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, the side scoop cannot go, and his right leg appears to be injured. How can no one tell: ten minutes earlier he fell into his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no further explanation for the viewer's curious mind, who would be curious to know such trivial things as "Where are the villains' body that should be close to the building?" and "Why is there no police or even curious people gathered around that body?" <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with the list. Why does another of the evil claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time? Why do bad people do stupid movements when they attack? Why does the hero look so faggy? Does anyone really think "yes, these characters and this plot make it a movie to remember"? And the actors suck. Our hero and rescuer of the day wears the same expression on his face. The entire movie. The terrible thing that is trying to be a beautiful smirk must be something copyrighted by him. <br /> <br /> Also think that 12% of people who rated this movie gave it a 10, full of fear inside. They could have been serious and then we are doomed.
