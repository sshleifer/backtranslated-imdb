I am a massive fan of prison dramas reflected in OZ, my very first American television show. I suppose the appeal is in a sort of slick voyeurism that wants to see bad things happen to the bottom of poor people, but I found Don Siegels RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 to be quite disappointing. Okay, I knew that since it was created in 1954, it would be devoid of bad language, graphic shanking and rape, but even though it is a rather weak movie compared to jail depiction in previous films such as EVER DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the film's preachy tone with riot leader Dunn is something of a prison reformer. Yes, it sounds ridiculous, as he is a fierce anti-hero, rather than some slack, polished wooden frames, he does on a pay, but that's what he is in essence, he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to reunite society rather than stay suffered from suffering. There is also a problem with making a B-movie with such radical themes (Very ironic that Siegel would later make DIRTY HARRY, where the only good criminal is dead), and that is not very good with Emile Meyer as hosts especially annoying in his performance. as I said a disappointing movie
