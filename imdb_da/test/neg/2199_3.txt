Rating: * 1/2 out of **** <br /> "The Net" is one of those movies that won't stay in your mind for the next hour. Well ... Just if you're still thinking about how bad it is. It is a mediocre, miserable, hollow, ridiculous and predictable piece of waste. One of the adjectives I've just used above is the reason why I added 1/2 star to the one I would have given. So is that the case of 'so bad, it's good'? No. It's a case of 'so bad, it's ridiculous'. <br /> <br /> Bullock in a (surprise!) very poor performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, has no friends, and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly she sees herself in dangerous situations after her colleague dies, and the same thing happens almost to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc. Contract. All are deleted and she is now Ruth Marx. The association even involves the government and ... Wait! Haven't we seen this before? Yes thousands of times. "The Net" is trying to be modern, to be a portrait of the 90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! It's a movie about nothing, just a pretext for showing ridiculous action scenes. Take the stage for the boat accident. I just laughed as the camera started to slow down ... <br /> <br /> What makes everything worse is Sandra Bullock. How terrible is she! Has she already made a decent movie? "A time to kill", okay. But she is still a bad actress who repeats her robotic face moving in each of her pictures. Vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in "2001: A Space Odyssey", the best, most intelligent and most complicated movie ever made. It is not necessary to compare "The Net" with it, is it ...? The only reason to see "The Net" is to laugh, as I have said, and to see what it is trying to be. The results, yes, are a shame. <br /> <br /> Delete this movie from your mind!
