It has been a long time since I have been in the theater of the art house, and I went to see Douches Froides because it has received such good reviews in the papers. Things are with this movie, it is It has no head or tail, but only a section on the time of the life of the three protagonists. <br /> <br /> When it started, I already knew it was a long time to sit down, but sometimes things get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between the players. You start in the middle of a situation, suddenly there is a boyfriend, and then there is a guy he needs to be friends to meet his sports ambitions, but the way they are assembled is quite strange when they are " just put together "so it works. <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable, and really all I could think of during the movie was "when should they get sex again?". And when you think about it, it's pretty crazy really. Because it basically means that there is nothing really worth looking at, but three teenagers go on it, and at least it makes me a very crazy movie, get rid of it and save your money (min 7, 50 is wasted) there are better art-house movies than this one. <br /> <br /> I give three stars to the upcoming performance, one each.
