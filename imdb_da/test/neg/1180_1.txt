What a waste of time to watch this movie. Poor picture quality, poor sound, bad action and absolutely not based on actual facts. The substitute's "boyfriend" did so much overactive, like the sheriff, that it was more comedy than horror. The substitute tries to make an emergency call by calling 911 ... PROBLEM ... in 1957 there was no emergency number. It is just an example of clear disagreements. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect was far underdone. I just didn't come that awful. <br /> <br /> I thought the actor who played Gein made the most admirable play in the whole movie. I could see mental disturbances in his character portrait. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... this just doesn't get it !!
