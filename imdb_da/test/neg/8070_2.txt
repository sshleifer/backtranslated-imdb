Rollerskating vampires?! I'm sorry, but even for the 80s it's just too cheesy to be extremely scary ... You can excuse the original for the odd kitsch moment because it parodied old movies and TV shows, but it has been done once, so the successor needed to be a small smaller camp, not even more outlandish! Plus, the first movie had the presence of Chris Sarandon - a man who could even make stalking discos in casual knitwear seem seductive! - that it is missing a lot, so there was no danger in anything that happened, it just seemed silly. Of course I only saw once when I was 7, but then there was already a huge fan of the original I remember being disgusted. For me, there is no successor to Fright Night, just a sticky spoof that doesn't deserve any rating at all.
