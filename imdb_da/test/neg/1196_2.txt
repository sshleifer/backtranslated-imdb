This movie was okay, but like most TV shows it would have been better if it was just for television. The best and most beloved characters had only five minutes of roles, while the three mediocre characters were all through the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British television-based films, this movie stops and it seems like a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world and waiting to catch the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't go anywhere when Hillary enters a room with the captured Steve, Lipp masquerading as Steve and Geoff somehow write to the Middle Ages. Which made me think? How does he not need a key to enter that world as opposed to the Royston Vasey characters? The medieval scene was okay, but Monty Python made it much better and of course more fun, with cameos from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both said nothing funny, Kay had a line and Pegg sat right on the wall and bored. br /> <br /> What also tore me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes that Hillary escaped to the Caribbean in the series 2 television, but in the film he has escaped from prison, and Lipp is also a pedophile vampire that was not mentioned at all in the film, which was also quite disturbing when he was alone looking for the children. <br /> <br /> There were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations like how did Geoff and the dark one fly from the Middle Ages back to Royston Vasey? Like Serie 3, it started well, but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending. They would have been better off doing what Monty Python did and reminding their best and classic sketches of series 1-3 and the Christmas special and turning it into a movie that would reintroduce the characters to a brand new audience that cannot be asked for to watch the series or too tight to buy the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Best advice is to save money and wait until it's on television ..... Where it belongs.
