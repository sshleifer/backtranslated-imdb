This is the worst kind of movie. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never look like they believe in themselves. Are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white murderers in their "good boys" of their 20s and must be convinced that this may be cause for provocation? Are black people universally inspiring? Does the Ku Klux Klan really run outside the courtroom that shoots at lawyers without intervening? Judges really believe that a fair trial can be carried out when the jury can hear a mob without shouting "Kill him"? Are black people really shoulder to shoulder with Klan and waiting to hear the verdict? Do wives really believe for months to realize that their husband might be able to defend a man from unfairly hanging out because he knew it could have done the same? Do jurists really give people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really need a sense of defense to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, every high-stitched principle in this movie was lost to the utterly exploitable and free use of sexual crime to titrate the audience. Was the subject of rape, let alone child rape, really in competent hands here? Is that really a topic that belongs to Hollywood? And if so why the totally free kidnapping and stripping of Sandra Bullock? And the completely meaningless compulsory rape against one of the witnesses? It looks like the director didn't feel strongly about sex crime. It took the excellent plot to kill a mockingbird and make a crass, low and tasteful money spinner from it. Shame on them.
