Look at all the positive user comments of this movie and check to see how often each user uses comments. They send once. It appears that businesses are likely to pay for services that send junk-pro movie comments to IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. The reason was stupid. The action was poor. The wit was not even fun. The movie included less nudity from what looked like porn actresses, but none of the other characters. It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the movie was not fun. There was some slapstick here and there, but most of the humor had to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and scattered rumors. This is not even well done. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast forward or better yet not seen. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this movie and if I could charge the studio and distributor for 1.5 hours they stole from me, I would.
