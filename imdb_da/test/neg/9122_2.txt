The band is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! Her brother demonstrates against the draft, and Charles Martin Smith does everything he can in Vietnam to be sent home. The questions from the 60s are brought to light here, but it's everywhere, beginning with New Year's Eve 1963, so three minutes later it's New Year's Eve 1964, so three minutes later it's New Year's Eve 1965, so three minutes later it's back in 1963 again. Martin Smith talks about his friend dying in a tow truck a year ago, and a few scenes later, this friend wins his next heat in a tug and on top of it all, the drug scene and the infants come into the picture (or pictures , in some cases, as many as three different camera images appear on the screen at the same time). <br /> <br /> To watch this movie, watch this movie, but I'd advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the start of the movie before almost all songs are played in the background, but where did he go? Maybe he couldn't watch this movie and finish! 2 out of 10 stars!
