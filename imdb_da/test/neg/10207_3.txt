I remember when they made a big deal about this when it came out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. The debut opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. So did it a nosedive. Critics HATED this movie. I can't remember seeing a good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant it then, but now I do, as the film makes references to gay bars, women are hit hard and almost raped and a disgusting look carried the toilet with overflowing urinals lol. When I was younger, I didn't like it. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! Now I find this pretty bad, but still fun to see once in a while when it is paired with Bodyslam (which has a better story). First, Hulk Hogan's acting values ​​are just not great. he is one-dimensional as the character he plays in the wrestling ring. And actually Rip and Hulk are not far apart. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he is not good at playing the bad guy. He is better at comedy and nervous drama. He's just not credible like Brell. There is not much character development in this movie, and those who suffer are the characteristics of Randy, Rip's brother and Charlie trainer (In wrestling it is unheard of by a trainer who leads a wrestler to the ring lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus as it should be played, so there is no problem there. Joan Severence is acceptable and for all your softcore dogs she has a lingerie scene lol. At the end you see what is the meaning? For this one (as with other wrestling movies or movies that have wrestlers like the star star), turn off your brain. You enjoy it more if you do.
