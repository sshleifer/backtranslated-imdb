I really don't understand who this movie is aimed at. From just the absurdity of it, not to mention the ridiculously bad play, cheesy dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child, I suppose it was supposed to be a children's movie ... but I think that there can be more swear words than Pulp Fiction, not to mention constant references to drugs and general chaos and killing - so what demographic is it trying to please? This movie is too schizophrenic, like trying to combine Country Music with Heavy Metal, in the end nobody likes it because it's a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it is so funny (in a bad way) unless the actors are so blatantly unbearable that I will not propose anything else. <br /> <br /> I'm really serious when I say I couldn't see more than 15 minutes of this. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
