Andrew Gurland's "Cheats" is his fictional "true story" of four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. The quartet is: Supercilious school-hating Trevor Fehrman (like Handsome Davis), his like-minded friend Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), their clumsy schooling chum Elden Henson (like Sammy) and crooked geekster Martin Starr (like Applebee). The adults include high-end North Point principal Mary Tyler Moore (like Mrs. Stark) and pornographic loving father Griffin Dunne (like Mr. Davis). The high jinks begin with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence seems to urinate on a teacher's character book. Put this at the bottom of the pile; And be grateful, it does not go on everyone's permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
