Movies like this give independent movies a bad name! This is simply a tedious composition of vines, with no structure at all. I would not be surprised if the writer was completely stoned. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, see "Half Baked." It is no award winning, but at least it made me laugh. The film was, of course, made in a micro budget. Each scene takes place either in a person's house, a person's apartment or an outdoor location. If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would have ignored the film's budget (as in the case of Edward Burns' movie), but of course this is not the case this time. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro from "A Bronx Speech" when I say, "There is nothing in the world worse than wasted talent." Everyone in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented artists! And they have all been in much better movies. The actors give it their all, but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And of course there was the short strip club scene at the start, which I also found appealing. <br /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting and history hardly exists. Many movies are terrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was "Bongwater's" intention? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
