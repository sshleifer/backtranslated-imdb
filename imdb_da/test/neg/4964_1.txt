Looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me thinking that large amounts of red corn syrup will please almost every brain dead idiot. This movie is beyond usability. All the clich√©s are of a slasher film without any substance. I'm sure I could go into details about the movie, but why bother when you can sum it up? Of course, everyone wants Mandy Lane, and she doesn't seem to want any of the boys. Throughout the film you see this. <br /> <br /> When she stops being friends with the typical boy trapped in friendship grabber, he goes ballistic and when she goes on a trip to the middle of no where of course) he begins to Chase them one by one. Does it sound decent so far right? But what made this movie suck at all is when you find out that not only is her losing friend the killer, but she is too. The plan was beyond ridiculous. Let's kill all our friends together and then kill each other. They give no reason why they wanted to do this, and as Mandy Lane's "Goody Too Shoes" model does, you'll scratch your head even more, which actually motivates these characters to do everything they do. It's sad .. this movie had lots of potential, but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience anyway.
