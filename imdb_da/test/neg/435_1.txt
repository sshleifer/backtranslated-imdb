I just don't understand that. Why does this call a sequel to the movie "American Werewolf" when it has absolutely no connection to it at all? The first movie was fun * and * scary with groundbreaking special effects. (If memory serves, the Oscar category for special make-up effects * was created * for this movie). "Paris" is none of these things. Awful effects, and not much else. Don't watch this movie. Rent the original "Werewolf in London" instead. You will be much happier.
