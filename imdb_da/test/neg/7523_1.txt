It's a Time Machine okay. It runs in "real time" for 96 minutes, but it felt like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were completely redundant. Massive amounts of "dead" time throughout. What happened? When does something happen? So what? Apparently the film was made on a tight budget. I notice for your structure the following: The Moroccans: Nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes of Lord of the Rings part I, hi? The "scary guy" responsible for controlling Morloch's ... The frightening thing these guys could think of was someone wearing one of Gene Simmons: (by the band Kiss) old costumes ??? Little known fact: The freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Pass this on.
