John Candy and Eugene Levy star like creepy security guards who chase down a big time mobster. Unfortunate is really the right word for this alleged comedy ... a few laughs, but mostly lusts and thoughts for yourself as "why do I see this c ** p?" Yes it is Meg Ryan in this too .. which I am sure she will not be reminded of .. a waste of a talented cast .. on a scale of one to ten.
