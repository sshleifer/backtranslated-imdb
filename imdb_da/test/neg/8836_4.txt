STAR PACKER is one of about 152,000,000 Westerns that John Wayne performed during the 1930s. Well, the figure is a little exaggerated, but it seemed almost like this many. This is because these B-movies were made quickly with very low budgets to be the second or less feature of a theater. Most Bs were pretty cheap and tend to cut corners to keep costs down and STAR PACKER is no exception. To save on costs, no random music is used, running times were kept within an hour. The script was often quite derived, and the actors are mostly smaller talents - and Wayne himself was far from being a house name at this time. Some of these Wayne features are pretty good, while others, like this one, are visible but also quite stupid and odd. I've enjoyed this movie and most others, but that's probably because I cut Bs very weak. <br /> <br /> Wayne stars like John Travers - an American Marshal examines actions by a local gang to chase out locals and steal from the scene. It's odd when the movie appeared to be in modern times or close to it as they used phones and modern machine guns - things you just wouldn't expect to find in the Old West. Such anachronism is actually quite common in B Westerns - as Gene Autry films (for example) are abundant with them. Wayne's sidekick is Yak - played by stuntman and real life boyfriend by Wayne, Yakima Canutt. The bad guy is an unknown character, referred to as "The Shadow", and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face! It sounds exactly like a character from a movie series - the kind of villain whom children loved, but adults moaned because they were so stupid and a little like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is, if you listen to his voice and are aware of it all, it becomes clear early in the movie that this "Shadow" is George Hayes. Now it's talk about Hayes, it's the same guy who later became known as Gabby Hayes in movies, but here and in several other Wayne's early films he looks and doesn't work like Gabby. In STAR PACKER he was well dressed, articulated and reindeer cut - imagine it! In fact, it seemed to be the real George Hayes - even though I doubt he was evil! Now that you can tell from the last paragraph, there really is no mystery in this movie. You are back with shopping (passable and nothing more) and stunts - which were actually pretty amazing. Again and again a fantastic stunt emerged after the other - as men jumped from horse to horse and some great fighting scenes - all by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often John Wayne's dual movie - and it went for decades. The problem with some of the stunts, however, is that it seems that the filmmakers actually killed a few horses to get the big "stumbling horses" bits seen later in the movie. Until about 1940, film producers often stuck thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop! In the process, the horse legs were usually broken and the horses were later euthanized! One of the worst examples of this was the movie JESSE JAMES - where several horses were brutally killed - leading to the American human association, insisting that a representative of the organization was on film shoots to confirm that animals are NOT harmed in production. So since about 1940, film carries this little disclaimer. STAR PACKER was made well before the disclaimer, and I can't see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed. All in all, this is at best an hour-fit due to a bad plot, occasionally bad acting and an incredibly cruel attitude to the horses. I'm not bleeding heart, but just can't understand this disregard for a poor old animal.
