I can't remember when I was last so disappointed with any movie. I probably expected too much to take place (in a way, you can expect action in dogma-style films of course). But nothing happens in here. Luckily I saw it at home and could change channels when silence and stupid / emotional faces started killing me. And it was very often! It is really not too much to see ugly people who do not speak and move slowly, finishers and French kiss men, not to mention ugly bodies with explicit sex. If only sensible ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; looks like it was only created to show one more vagina, as zero characters are actually able to solve the crime. Having only four pseudo-developed characters and a movie that goes nowhere, it is pretty soon obvious who the director picked as the killer. And that also makes no sense. Despite all the boredom and suffering, I must admit that it somehow touched me in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should check it yourself, even if I do not recommend it.
