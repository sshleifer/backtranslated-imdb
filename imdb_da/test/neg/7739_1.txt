Every boy finally learns the lesson that just because a girl is beautiful does not mean she is good. Well, the limb tells you, age 19, learned lesson. It's hard to tell what's worse: Kathy Ireland's acting skills, or her ultra-high voice; the one who sounds like a screaming mouse on helium scrapes his little little claws on the board. With an incomprehensible plot in the outer space of dwarfs who want Kathy Ireland's bones by some unclear reason, this movie is just wrong on so many levels. If there was ever a candidate for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 upbringing, it would be.
