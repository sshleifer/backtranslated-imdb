I have heard a lot about the camera's work and direction in the invention in this movie. I thought both were a mess <br /> <br /> also some really horrible plays. The main theme "heroine" in the film is annoyingly out of faith and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation. All she does or says is silly, and she generally only seems to ruin people's lives. If she could fight, I can forgive her <br /> <br /> In general, all the women in this movie are stereotypical "wider" who need a man to save them. and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits who are able to save none <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie and I urge you to avoid it. See something like "the sword of judgment" instead, I hear it much better than this confusing mess on a movie.
