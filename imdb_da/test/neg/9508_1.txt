<br /> <br /> The game has been heavily edited and the sequence of scenes is completely mixed up. The actor is horrible (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and the film's poor. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confused, boring movie that will instantly put the new ones to Shakespeare from Shakespeare! <br /> <br /> If you can't see a stage game then look at the Olivier version (1948) at least instead of this trick!
