How can any of you call this propaganda a family movie. This is nothing more than a PC, insensitive insult to small towns. The film depicts a woman as the great white savior in some small Midwestern cities, and everyone else in the city (mostly men) is just pure damsels in distress, out of honor who cannot cope with themselves and must rely on the protagonist of redemption. This movie is just a love affair that the producer has with some unspoken, arrogant, intrusive little syringe that he expects the audience to admire. <br /> <br /> The person who made this movie probably spent his entire life in a searching sensitive church and had the freedom to dump waste into small church members who were crazy lunatic and not the majority. The same people who give money to Salvation Army by Christ, collect donations to help missionaries, the poor, and the homeless, sing, co-ship, and make friends with each other. What's wrong with this humble group that offends these self-righteous traitors? Most Christians in this world would step in front of a train and give their lives to any person in trouble even if they disagree with them. Most Christians would not mind if the priest or a church worker in some church took off his dress (or outer shirt). They didn't want to condemn her. This movie is ridiculous!
