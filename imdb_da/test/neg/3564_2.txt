A depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active elderly lady who doesn't like to use shades or curtains in her windows. He steals various things from her, looks at her, calls prank and plays various unpleasant tricks on her. It's odd that he doesn't keep her off her. At first she didn't seem to care about one or the other that he was bothering her. So later she seems to start respecting him for his cruel fever activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical things to note. One is that the guy looks into the night through a window of glass from the lighter side. In fact, such a thing would not happen. The more bright side of a pane acts as a mirror. He would see exactly nothing. Any illogical thing is that the creepy teenager takes a job as a milkman and his one and only customer every morning seems to be the woman he chooses. Easy work if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw a short film about love on a public display. At the end there was not a single open eye in the house. A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE is the foreign language movie for those who do not like to read subtitles. Not only are there very few words spoken in the movie, but much of the movie is silent. Some rest in peace.
