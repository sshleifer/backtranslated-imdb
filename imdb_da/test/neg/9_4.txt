David Bryce's comments in the vicinity are exceptionally well-written and informative that almost says everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and overblown, overproduced and must have caused a break in Paramount in 1970. It cost $ 22 million! It is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been green from a board meeting that said "hello, we have the Pink Panther guy, and that Sound Of Music gal ... let's also get it" and handed in a blank check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40's song and dance figures in a style (daisies and boat owners!) So hopelessly old-fashioned to be like musical porridge and MATA HARI drama. The production is colossal, lush and breathtaking to see, but the rest: The ridiculous romance, Julie looks enchanted, Hudson already dead, the foggy comedy and the amazingly boring songs kill this spectacular movie to be annoying. LILI is like a two 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released the year before unfortunately crashed and now being finally appreciated for the excellent movie is really is ... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I really believe killed by the mega musical binge of the 60s ..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again ... which I think was not Edward's intention. Paramount must have been collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $ 20 million party in CATCH 22 and $ 12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON .... they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $ 77 million tied in 4 movies with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked viewer Daisy Gamble off on a clear day ...... LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for several months, but it once failed in the sub and sticks and only ever surface after that on one night stands on a clean day like a Sunday night double. Thank God Paramount had their simple $ 1 million (yes, one million dollars) movie LOVE STORY and that $ 4 million dollars gangster pic GODFATHER is also ready to restore all $ 77 million in the next two years .... for only $ 5m . ... incredible!
