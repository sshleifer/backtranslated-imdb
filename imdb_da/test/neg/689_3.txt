This film is a cinematic collage of gangster clich√©s. The script is class z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic. It is a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and stupid supporting characters (the doctor and author). There are much better Bogart movies out there. In fact, Bogart looks like he's been sleeping through this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the direct advice he received was something like "He's a bad guy. Acting badly". This guy is the equivalent of the era to Darth Vader; Obvious, evil and anti-hero. Don't waste your time with this one.
