I go to blockbuster, choose a random movie, have it here and yes. <br /> <br /> This was a good sexual porn. That kind of quality sucked, and it gave me a shame headache. For me, this movie was good for its sexual things, but not so much for horror and excitement. It was ... magical ... The excitement ... not as good as I would have expected. I wanted to be at the edge of my seat and hoped to jump up in fear, but instead I sat down on the couch and didn't see much. The quality .. not really good at all. I mean, if you pay close attention to when people are on the COLD mountains, they hardly have anything. It also doesn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a crap, not really exciting, and a pretty sexual movie, you're here.
