I saw this because of the description and cover art and was again deceived. I get sick of all these new stupid people just for DVD screaming. In a blue moon, 1 will be OK. It started with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a few a night in a thunderstorm, which was OK because I liked the storms and it was a good mood. Then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up having a dinner encounter with bizarre people. The rest became weird and became so confusing. I saw it to the end, but was even more confused as it ended so badly. I had higher hopes for this movie, but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for television.
