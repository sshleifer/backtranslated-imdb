I didn't like this movie. For me it didn't make much sense. It was hard to figure out what really happened. I didn't think it was scary either. However, I thought it was silly, even absurd, but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the protagonist of the movie that cam out in 2003. She was also coincidental in 2006's "Silent Hill" that I hated. Also I found confusing and pointless. "Visitors" It's not that bad, but I think it's certainly below average. It's just nothing special about it. The script is just too muddled, and there are things in the movie that don't have to be there, in my opinion. I think Radha Mitchell is a good actress if she has more to work with. My vote for "Visitors" is 4/10
