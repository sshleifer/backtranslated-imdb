Richard Donner shows his liberal credentials with this ridiculously overcooked simplified attack on South Africa's policy. It's not as if America is the breed's harmony and fraternal love - and further irony is added by the film being put into town, home to Rodney King and glorifying the police department that did so much in relation to community relations with their brutal racist behavior. So Donner's salt and pepper paste, which clearly has a late-developing teenage crush on each other, does their own thing with the fine rule of rule of law or the rules of evidence, and no one cares because the evil ones are white South Africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? Within Rudd's (Joss Ackland - Eminently Hissable) office, the decor is designed and illuminated so that it resembles Fuhrerbunker as far as possible and just in case some rather stupid movie runs miss that point, he and his men are periodically referred to as "Nazis ". For me, the only bright spot in the movie was when Mel Gibson came up with an anti-apartheid demonstration with a banner with the inscription "End Aparthied Now". The intensely annoying Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around by shedding incessantly as a poorly trained puppy. This would be tolerable if there was the slightest possibility for him to end up in a concrete cover, but unfortunately he survives to annoy another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems in her own world, maybe not to believe her luck by being thrown opposite Mel Gibson, who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home, which seems to have been washed up on a beach somewhere . Shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters who burn enough rounds in Mel's caravan to keep the US Army in Iraq for six months. Fortunately, he has a dog that is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus, as they go in seconds, and his bark warns them of the imminent attack. I hope he got a special bone as a reward. The movie climaxes (without interruption from Mel's dog) on ​​a cargo ship tied to Nazi Germany (sorry South Africa) when Mel and Danny kill so many members of the championship as I lost count. Despite jiggling around like Bonnie and Clyde during the impact of a shot of bullets, Mel survives, curled up in his partner's arms as a small child with a clever and benevolent father. Take it, Apartheid!
