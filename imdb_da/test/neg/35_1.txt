Maniratnam, which in India is often compared to prominent world film producers and is considered a genius in filmmaking, has once again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good without offering much food for thought. Forget about pure cinematic enjoyment that can come from cinema as a very old art form. While I do not want to claim and portray myself as one who has seen all the beautiful films made around the world, there are still some thoughtful and slightly educated film goers can identify that his film does not contain innovative genius plots, do not contain lingering effects afterwards and most contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama, seen violently in Indian movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, Maniratnam has once again confirmed my tasting for his films. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who on this board stated otherwise. My suggestion to you: See some beautiful CINEMAS made around GLOBE.
