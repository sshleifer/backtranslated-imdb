One of the few reasons to make these pointlss movies is to give some actors a chance to hopefully steal in better movies, if they are acting, something good. The only good thing in this movie is the play, the three female leads are better than most horror movies like this. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br/> <br /> Small children use to crawl through holes and add dynamite to explode mines. When you collapse causes a hole in all the children die, become zombies. Adults in the mine are dying, there is no reason why the children become carnivorous. When they were still alive, they were frightened of the cave, innocent, so they had to be furious with any adult who exploited them in my mines (only reason to think). A mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a country devolper who wants to build a resort and another of those scary people who seem to know exactly what is happening, but no one believes him. <br /> <br /> Nothing new here, you are usual clich√©s, predictable, many negative for this movie, very few positives.
