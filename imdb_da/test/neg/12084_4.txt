Not good. Mostly because you do not give an enemy what happens to all these people. Some comments: 1. I'm tired of seeing governors who never talk to their students, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look when that student, of course, has won in 4 seconds 2. Fine, so Rosina has a father complex and is therefore attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects of his father - if anything Henry is much closer to a sensual, lofty person 3. How could you ever believe she would be more attracted to Tom Wilkinson than to Rhys Meyer. 4. Hard to believe if she was actually raised as a deeply religious girl, she would be so careless about sleeping with a gentile after knowing him for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Some good things about film: At least she didn't finish pregnant, knowing who Dad was ... The whole description of life in the Jewish community in London is good
