I decided to watch this movie to fall asleep. It kept me awake, so it was interesting; However, it was pretty bland. <br /> <br /> The action was good. I don't think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as trustworthy as an over-the-hill hit-man can be. The dialogue in this movie does not offer many opportunities for these actors to show their full potential, but they still shine. The atmosphere was amazing. The music was good and the colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint to the viewers. Even the weather improved the mood of the movie. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The errors in this movie are in its history development. The story with mafia vs blackbird doesn't get enough attention. The story of Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI seems to work extra fast here. Is there no paperwork for all these processes? Is it really so easy to dig up your brother's body from his grave, burn the corpse and get it identified as you? There are too many loops in the story for me to give this movie something higher than a 4 out of 10 rating. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they are really bored and have smoked some really good grass. Although WoW is down for maintenance, find something better to do than watch this movie.
