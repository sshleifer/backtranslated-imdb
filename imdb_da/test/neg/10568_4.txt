I was more entertained by seeing my wife almost pulling her hair into frustration through most of this movie. I thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the milk jug for a moment. So I cheated, grabbed the remote and was relieved to find that it ended in just 20 minutes. I should have turned the channel. Sweet, it had potential but yuck!
