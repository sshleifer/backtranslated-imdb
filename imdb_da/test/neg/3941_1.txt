Usually I was a big fan of 'Stay Alive' trailer, as it was released even a few months before. I continued to tell my friend how this movie has a great story plot - and maybe a good one. Anyway - this movie is slightly below my expectations. The plot has great potential, but how the story unfolds with the actor, director and bad CGI - this movie is a disaster. The ghost makes no sense, including the killings - it's just too fast and creates a sense of "unrealistic" in the audience's mind. <br /> <br /> This movie may be scary for some audiences - but fear in a sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc.) instead of persistent fear due to some valid factors in the movie. <br /> <br /> You should consider watching this movie.
