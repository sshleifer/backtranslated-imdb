I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, very poor quality video and especially horrible sound. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and almost no examples of direct connection to recent and contemporary electronic music. Interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad hoc mostly naughty mumbo jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average level of attention, even for a slow and / or difficult subject, I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to go through it to see the parts I slept on through. If you see this, make sure you are created before you see it as Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than this. Shame on the producer and the director.
