To be honest, I have never been to the Congo or even Africa, and after watching it for TV movie Heart of Darkness, I don't think I want to. The movie is completely ashamed of the book to the highest level possible. Although the book was not the best I have read, I thought to appreciate the book a hundred times more after watching the movie. Nicolas Roeg, the film's director, did a terrible job exclaiming Joseph Conrad's short story in a movie. I give Roeg some credit to try to make the impossible by making the book a movie, but it couldn't have been working for him. The movie failed to express any part of the novel beyond the basics of the plot. The set and nature also lacked the beauty of Conrad, depicted by Africa in the book. In the book Marlow had seen so many good wonders, but in the film you did not get the same experience. No, I don't owe everything to the director; The action in the movie was just awful. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the film, I felt as if the actors did not make any feelings as if they were reading from the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, does not portray Marlow's adventure adventure for his journey into the Congo Well. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz was to venturesome, but I didn't see it in the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you have already read the book. It doesn't come close to doing justice to Joseph Conrad's short story. Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with Marlow, on his quest to find Mr. Kurtz, where the movie didn't. A great novella, but a very bad movie. Heart of Darkness, the film, is based on the book written by Joseph Conrad also called Heart of Darkness.
