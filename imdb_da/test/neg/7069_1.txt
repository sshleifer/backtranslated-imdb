A friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. I was curious because it had developed a bit of a cult status. I like many odd indie cult movies, so I gave it a shot. I agree with my friend. It's a steaming pile of fertilizer. I'm sorry for the people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better things if you want to see a twisted Indian cult movie. Try Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (aka Braindead), Cemetery Man (aka Dellamorte Dellamore) or Modern Vampires.
