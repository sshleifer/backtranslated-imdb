You can generally ask two questions about the 80's low-budget horror film. and this "Demon Wind" in particular. 1. Is it a good movie? No .. 2. Is it a fun movie ?? You can believe that! Demon Wind is a horribly dirty and nauseating tale filled with cheesy make-up effects and nasty violence. The story is largely non-existent and involves a group of young people revealing one of the group's ancestors' terrible secrets. Apparently, his grandparents used to live in a devil-worshiping neighborhood, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still lives there. But I have to give it to this movie. From the beginning to the end, it adds morbidity! The devilish undertones, the playful gore, and the (relatively) decent actor all make this film completely asserted over the ordinary, uninspired 80's slashes. It shows some creativity and gut (literally), where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of 'The Evil Dead', and perhaps even Lamberto Bavas' Demons, but what heck! It is fun and made with great enthusiasm. Although this movie has a rather high `what f *** 'standard at times. Especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are delighted to be mixed. And what the hell is the story of the two wannabe magicians? Nevertheless, Demon Wind gets my recommendation if you are not too high with crap horror!
