There are three main problems with the movie. Or rather, there are three reasons why it is not even a challenge that is more serious consideration. <br /> <br /> First, it would always be true, it's almost not as good as the books. However, at least we could have expected to reflect some of Sapkowski's wit or depth. <br /> <br /> Second, we have the production. Fantasy films, in my opinion, are the hardest to produce well. Everything from the props via costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) CGI is substandard. Finally, and many are very subjective, I just can't quite take the play seriously. I was not brought up in Poland, so I can not really judge - this is my lack of knowledge of film in Polish. Similarly, the lines seem to be very amateurish to supply ... The molding can also be better. <br /> In summary, the only possible redemption feature in this movie is the rest of the plot shining through: not unlike a diamond ring on a decaying carcass. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, I heard that the books come in English. I haven't seen them yet, but I can't imagine how you would even start translating them ... I would ask the English-speaking reader to bear this in mind when judging the book.
