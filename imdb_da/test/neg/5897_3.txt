I tried. Lord help me how I tried. But there are only some people who are almost incapable of creating quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To their credit "9/11 Commission report" seems to be an honest attempt by the company to move on to a more sophisticated state of narration and filmmaking. But for all purposes and purposes it appears like another real movie in their gallery. At the opening, the disclaimer informs the public that all names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively similar. A man named Mussaui is trying to learn how to fly a plane. With a coal grimass that would immediately make anyone uncomfortable, this "undercover" agent can learn to fly on a small computer. And you have to wonder, not how he could get into this program so easily, but how these people didn't even ask questions; because this scene is so far retrieved in its presentation, and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top. And you can see that director Scott is trying to imitate Paul Greengrass with a light-grained photograph, followed by a very dizzying and annoying hand-held direction, which throughout the film tries to take out of Greengrass's gung-ho guerrilla film techniques. <br /> <br /> You can feel Scott imitating Greengrass's technique for realism, but it gets pretty paralyzed halfway through. Meanwhile, the film comes out of less a "Traffic" departure and more a take off on "Law & Order", where we want the disclaimer that notifies us, the names have been changed, reminds the logo almost about "Law & Order" logo and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their coffins and discussing politics. <br /> None of them is as convincing as it is trying to be. And then, when the film seems like its attempt to be an adult drama, Scott relies on his old failsafe, sex scene. Scott's new movie looks like it will really be considered a low budget "Munich", but it is not, and it manages to be underwhelming at every possible opportunity. The "9/11 Commission Report" falls flat and that is because it is limited in its attempts to imitate other films. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate the ambition inherent in the camera, this new perspective of events leading up to 9/11 is flat and boring. As it may be trying to be a low budget "Munich", it's just as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren movie you find on Cinemax.
