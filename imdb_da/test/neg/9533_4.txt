This film was so unfocused, wandering and uneven that it was an attempt to see it all. (I actually thought some interesting plural elements could evolve.) This was no more than a "coming-of-age" movie for the thirty generation. Total crap, and I have no idea what Julianne Moore did in this as it was the only reason I picked it from the shelf at the rental shop.
