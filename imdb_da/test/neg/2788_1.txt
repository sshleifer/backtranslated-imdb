Let's start by acknowledging that there are probably three types of horror movies: good, bad and utterly embarrassing rolls that make the whole genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises great with its Artisan DVD cover, but be sure it is where the show stops. After a cruel opening montage, we soon discover that the film is composed of a very poorly written script, extremely qualified (even for a novice movie) acting, catastrophic lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, no one could afford anything more than a badge for the villain, or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so that's good enough for us? Well, it didn't work at all to create a scary villain. It is at least one of those movies that makes you check your watch, sigh and curse your own credibility. The timing of each scene is painful, and the whole production has a middle school that feels like it (think of it, I've seen better middle school stage productions, right down to the special effects). I try to think somehow to finish this review with a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters, Frisbees, wind chimes ....... I will say " See yourself, but it would just be cruel. Check out the rest of this production company's reviews and you'll find the same for every movie. They claim to honor the contract between the film and the audience (ie the fans), but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash (which I am sure they saw very little for this). <br /> <br /> Sorry people, the high ratings and favorable reviews are of course listed by those who are directly or indirectly associated with this travesty. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it's the lowest possible rating. Giving it yourself makes me angry.
