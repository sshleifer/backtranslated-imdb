** MAJOR SPOILERS ** Only available for action sequences, not history or acting in the "Nature Unleashed: Four" has one of the longest and eerie conclusions in modern film history. We have the fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, who brings this trio of hysterical cyclists to safety in every step an explosive smoke sock This under a furious forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of the great outdoors, did not realize that a mining shaft leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the forests around it are on fire! <br /> *** SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON *** All of this started some time ago when Ranger Jake in an attempt to save it on the ball the miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "The Sherd" , let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! Even though we were in the forefront of who put forest fires in the first half of the movie, it was not a surprise that all the little ones were the culprit! As you would expect in movies like these little ones seemed to be made of hardened steel, because nothing that ever happened to him, burning explosions as well as impaling, could stop the bile mines. <br /> <br /> Before Tiny's resurrection, or resurrection, Ranger Jake was involved in rescuing cyclists Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were caught in the woods with broken fires. around them. Having the usual thing about the whole-Marcus among the cyclists doesn't go as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus not only eggs on the wise Chris to do something stupid, jumping with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but has the guy break his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to get Chris out before the fire consumes him as well as his co-drivers! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie Ranger Jake, who puts himself in charge, boner makes bones in his attempt to save himself and it caught and lost in the forest cyclists! All this ends with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party, just meters away from saving them if they were only kept and in the open where the rescue team could find them! <br /> <br /> Even though he was supposed to be the party or movie, Tiny came for all his efforts to be another indestructible super villain like a man who spent too much time in the sun. The make-up job at Tiny was so scandalous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burnt to a crisp. Ranger Jake came over as either something very naive or retarded in his being so taken by the dangerous little in always trying to save the raging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules of the Forest Ranger. In fact, Ranger Jake urged little to do both him and the cyclists by showing him how incompetent he was trying to save them. That Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so smart, but because Tiny, despite his immortality, was so brainless!
