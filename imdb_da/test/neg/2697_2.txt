A female ex-policeman who was drummed out of the power of recklessness (and likely to beat Chuck Norris in a fight) lays out as a private bodyguard; her first client is a worthless playboy type. It takes half of the movie for her to get kicked off the power in the first place. Lots of great battle choreography, but the plot is strictly by the numbers, and the play is like wood as the dialogue. Give this one a lady.
