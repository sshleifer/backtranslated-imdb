Let me start by saying that I am a great fan of Abbie Hoffman and have read Steal this book and steal this urine test. Also an even bigger Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was an exciting pile of waste that made a very PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director took no chances to make Abbie Hoffman interesting in this movie. The dismissed Stew Albert as an F *** ing cartoon chjaractor without intellectual, the man was a professional at Berkley for Christ. Okay, they did a horrible casting job for Anita Hoffman, made a horrible job casting for Jerry Rubin's character. I just guess the movie doesn't fit the news I've seen by Abbie or the books he wrote. The movie just doesn't fit and disturbs me. Oh yes and teat is the absolute worst voice I've ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies I've ever rented that I couldn't sit all the way through because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and his discreet band of Yippies, and this movie was simply poorly executed. And it hurt me, now that people are watching a movie about the yippers, they will see a terrible adaptation and not get a real sense of reality. Instead, they get a hollywoodized palace of crap. <br /> <br />
