Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form Seagal. This movie simply had no substance. Very long, pronounced and boring. Scenes were much longer than they might be - the camera would often focus on something for long periods when there was absolutely nothing. Cure for insomnia. Worst Seagal movie by far (I like some of his other movies). 1.10
