When something can be something you want it to be or mean, it is bound to register with someone as being quite special. But like the shape of a cloud in the sky can occur to one of us or remind us of a battleship and to another of its aunt's back and yet another absolutely nothing but a cloud, this cloud does not make meaningful except from viewers' interpretation. Anyone who might find out that a full-fledged giraffe is out of a window brilliant or valuable for that matter, without having to relate in any way, may only attempt to impress us with his or her intellectuality. This movie that dreams of a madman makes it pretty pretty, especially since there is no standard or expectation of what those dreams would be, and even though we were evil ourselves, it would hardly give us reference points for comparison. A love affair with this film entails the same risk as seriously interpreting Nostradamus. Whatever the real meaning was conveyed at that time, it could be limited in the private jokes, musings or provincial minutes of its time and to a selection of few radical intellectuals on it! I saw a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely anti-fascist and to some extent anti-Italian. I noticed that even though the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in Italy, some indication of this seemed to be avoided. In addition (avant-guarde academic spinners note this to your next class), the very short cropped male with the crossbones of the party segment near the end is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his tall female companion none other than Queen Helen, formerly Princess of Montenegro. Without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs, who would rely on irrelevance to impress us. <br /> <br /> I like to add my own paint bucket to the defacement of this cinematic joke. But in an adaptation of the famous courage of the little boy; The movie really has no face (to deface). Paint would help it burn.
