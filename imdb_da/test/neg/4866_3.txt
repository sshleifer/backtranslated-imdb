This movie begins with a pedestrian setup before blaming in the normal form of excitement action, where a clerk continues to look up trained secret service men, etc. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say the play was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by Hamilton and Sheen - but I really didn't want to. <br /> <br /> At least, Risiblefinale gave me a good laugh for my pain. But if my life flashed for my eyes, I think I would accelerate those 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two lines of text to get this stuff published. Yes, very resistant dress that shine carries. I made a special promise to myself to never see a movie here badly again.
