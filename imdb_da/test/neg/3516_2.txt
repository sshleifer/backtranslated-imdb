In no way should this overly simplistic script, with virtually one character, be interpreted as function entertainment. In fact, it is about sufficient material in an eighteen minute card, and even that would seriously tax your attention span. Zero characters beyond Noble Willingham have been developed. The endless close-ups of lips and phones are sleep-inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. In fact, this whole sad thing should not have been put on film. A tape recording would have been more than sufficient to put you to bed. Definitely not recommended. - NOTE
