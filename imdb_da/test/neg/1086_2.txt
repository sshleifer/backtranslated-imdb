I am very surprised to see the good reviews for this movie. I watched the movie 9 years ago and I still remember how angry I felt sitting in the cinema and looking at this mess. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his movie. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with great expectations. But I felt like watching a stupid, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie with all the action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't believe John Boorman was director because this movie was so poorly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better movies to illustrate their struggle.
