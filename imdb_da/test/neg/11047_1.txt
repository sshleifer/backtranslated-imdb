It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing that can make the viewer against this movie is the graphic violence. In fact, violence, both disturbing and cartoon-like, is the last of "Oldboy's" deep flaws. The characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director are served by the cheapest means. Let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic value. At the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted, so the manuscript is almost unintentionally fun in its efforts to find new levels of "horror" to continue to "shock" an audience already stunned by abundance of stupid soap operas "revelations" already served in large clusters. It would be hard to imagine that anyone even vaguely acquainted with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema is thrilled by this pompous piece of waste. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitantly in front of theater theater: "Should I go in or should I buy five ice cream cones for the same money?" Be smart, Homer, go to the ice.
