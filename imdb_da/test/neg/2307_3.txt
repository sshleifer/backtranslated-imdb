Film based on Jacqueline Susann's best-selling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) a ruthless TV anchor complaining to the top. It describes his love life by concentrating on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his total inability to commit to someone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get. The novel is not a work of art (it is not even good literature), but it is a quick, silly, trashy read. But this movie makes it look like "Gone With the Wind"! This is a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie adaptation. First, they condense the novel terribly. In the book, Stone's inability to commit is treated, and it is revealed why. Here it is brought up ... and ignored. There is also a really disgusting scene where a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but there's a reason completely out of the movie. And the book treated three women - not two. Don't even get me started on homophobia. <br /> <br /> Adapting aside the play is quite awful. The law is just awful as stone - a lot of wood and boring - you seriously wonder why all these women are after him. To be fair to the law - another actor was thrown, but had a very bad accident before the shot began and the law came in at the last minute. Wexler is terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really amazingly bad as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable like Christie Lane. Only three performances stand out: David Hemmings (has a great time) rents it as a gay photographer; The cannon is actually very good and Robert Ryan is just amazing. Also Dionne Warwick sings the captivating opening song ("He Moves On"). It's bad, but I saw it all and it's (in a silly kind of way) very fun. I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> Also Jacqueline Susann has a cameo as a news machine.
