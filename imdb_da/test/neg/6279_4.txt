H.G. Wells' World War I David Michael Latt is a little less than average flick, which is not so bad considering the budget he had to work with - only $ 1 million. For this budget, the production value was not so bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (I was thoroughly impressed with CGI considering the budget) and sound design. The less end-star parts of this movie are the story that is highly extended (but again I think it is because of the budget they had - they had to extend certain scenes to create the function length 97 minutes) (again, it because the actors had no story to work with), very few extraordinary camera pictures and the music. But again I can leave the negative parts mostly only because this film was made for a modest budget and still had a good production value. Nevertheless, you should see it to see how a low budget version of World of War can be performed even with errors. 4 out of 10
