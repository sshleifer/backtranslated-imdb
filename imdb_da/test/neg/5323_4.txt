Just once, I would like to see Koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director and producer! Just once! <br /> <br /> This is a good trial by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt at Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure and unadulterated waste. The actor must be shot to masturbate Koontz's work this way and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> History is a well-written story, but the manuscript is pretty boring, incredible, and terribly accomplished. The only elements that work are the results of LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I really wanted this to work. I love Koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, support and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's work that they shoot the barrels right into the king's, Koontz will quickly rise. But unfortunately! Without powerful people who believe in their work, I fear he never gets the chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this film was a total suck. As a standalone movie, it wasn't that bad, though it was extremely weak in many places with big plot holes and horrible, rigid, unprofessional dialogue that should never have made it to the final cut. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. Had they followed Koontz's original work a little closer and invested a decent amount of production money, it could have been a much better bet. <br /> <br /> But all I can see in this is how good it could have been, and it wasn't. <br /> <br /> It ranks 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
