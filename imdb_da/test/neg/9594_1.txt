******** SPOILER ALERT ************** Wasted 85 minutes in my life watching this "movie". First of all, we think it is fun that the producer came into the movie as the autopsy doctor with an awful unbelieveably incredible accent - what the hell was it anyway Romanian? And how is it that in Denmark does not speak Danish except moss creatures? (Note, the Scottish camper ...). ? And who does shopping for moss creatures? Their pants looked like they were bought from the Banana Republic. Very neatly dressed to be 1200 years old. This one was worse than Scarecrow Slayer (we didn't think it was even possible). We basically spread quickly through 75% of the movie looking for some gore / death / scary moments. No one found. Rent the DVD just to watch the 2 hours "Behind the Scenes of Bog Creatures" featurette. Who are these people? Are they serious? And the filmmakers are like 60 years old. I think this is their holy grail and it is pathetic enough in itself. BEST LINE from the movie, hands down: "Not bad for a girl who never even went to school." My blind grandmother, having Alzheimer's, could make a better movie.
