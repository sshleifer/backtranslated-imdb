Come on. How did all these talented actors / actresses end up in this mess? Was it a sort of blackmail / lost game situation? Vinnie, you're a muscle man. Be what you were born to. <br /> <br /> Hot tub scene? Scrabble the scene? I waited to hear the "needle pulling over the record" sound at all times. <br /> <br /> And what about him carrying the priceless Dickens manuscript with him? Let's see I'm full in a bar, why not draw the priceless Dickens manuscript? I'm going to meet some dubious thugs down the Thames, why not take my priceless Dickens manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. Avoid.
