'Volcano' is at best a B-movie, and at worst it is more of a disaster that what it should portray. To be fair, you must be prepared for any movie to suspend disbelief for a great concept. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the grand, yet 1990-sensitive, Emergency Management Office competition, and he's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides. But Anne Heche gives a howling bad performance as a smart-ass geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (while the city is burning down, natch). Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and the US President for a trip as a killer, needy and victim of the life of Jones. Don Cheadle is going to sit at a real coooool office and take Jones phone calls, do the work that Roark really wanted and needed to do. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie really starts to go downhill when Heche's geological partner gets sucked into a lava wait while they break into metro lines. It is gaining momentum when Jones begins to suggest that they use buses to dampen the flow of lava flowing down the street, Heche's geologist (who loves to teach everyone about The Science of Geology) apparently is unaware that lava is hot and it melts metal and rock, and a dead bus has hardly any effect. It really starts to suck when the film introduces Rodney King-like racial tension between two bad actors dressed as police and an angry black man who cannot understand why the fire department is concerned with this vast river of floating lava. But in the end, the three are working together to build a K-rail dam to prevent lava from eating its neighborhood, even though the dam is built in the wrong direction, and the material used would not stop lava anyway. Furthermore, K-rails are hardly waterproof, but I think lava would not think of sticking their heads through the holes, not when Tommy Lee Jones welcomes it. Let me not even get started on the subtotal stretch of subway, where a tunnel-like hot lava comes down, but strangely, it is not too hot to try to save, it is not too smoky to see, and there are no toxic gases so everyone can breathe. This should be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, it does eat cars but is environmentally friendly. <br /> <br /> There are moments of pure camp here that almost make you wonder if this was supposed to be a comedy. For example, the two security guards who unpack Hieronymus Bosch paintings have a completely pointless and colorless conversation about weight, and ultimately, the little boy saves Roark / Jones that everyone sees the same while they are covered in ashes, than a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone up - and then the sun comes out and Heche says something in line with "aw, shucks, Roark". <br /> <br /> 'Volcano' achieves almost Battlefield Earth status, but apart from Heche, no one goes to Travolta-like badness, and the technical aspects are handled quite well. If you are from the LA area as I am, it is fun to think of a lava stream wiping out Wilshire Boulevard. I gave it a three for the effects and the small amount of tension you get from this.
