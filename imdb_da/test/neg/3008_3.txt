There is nothing I hate more in a movie than pretentiousness, and this is one of the most pretentious movies ever made. It is self-awareness that is evident in every frame: "See what a deep and sophisticated film we are doing", the director and the screenwriters seem to say to us, and for themselves they say "let's see how we can drill and confuse The audience even more. "I'd rather see the worst movie of Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than anything like this. At least they gave us honest garbage, and at least their movie was entertaining in their own horrible way. This film is about being entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and it is therefore torture. Have these manuscripts ever heard the word 'story'? It doesn't look like that. They have a concept they are capable of creating an atmosphere and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and produce good performances from them. And what? To drill us for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, and it only lasts about two minutes, arises when one of the soon-to-be-run homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who are going to tell him he should leave. But nothing comes of it. Too bad he didn't continue to shoot before he hit the writers. The only redeeming features of this movie are the actor and some beautifully photographed scenes towards the end. 3.10
