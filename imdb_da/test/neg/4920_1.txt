Well, at least it was the last successor I could find at Blockbuster because this movie was just awful. I mean, I can understand how difficult it would be to get rid of an evil house. We're talking about starting a terrible fire, bulldozing, flooding, etc. But a mirror? How hard could it be to get rid of a mirror? This was the most horrible movie that could have put the title of Amityville in the picture! <br /> <br /> Now, a group of friends who are pretty much from the start, are a bunch of freaks. One of them is a photographer of some sort and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy, teaches me a valuable lesson, doesn't buy things from homeless, cruel guy. Of course, the horrible deaths and chaos follow this group, though I can't imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please skip Amityville: A new generation, I have already received some complaints about my generation, so I think it was a prelude. Not that sounds so crazy. : P But believe me, this is terribly acted, not well thought out, and not even scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror, they must cry every time you testify to this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
