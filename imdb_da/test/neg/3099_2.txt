What is the story, what is it on the screen. First I have to say, don't touch this movie, it's for your own good (it sucks). And what is the story, at first it seems okay, but after ten minutes it all gets worse. And that's not all you can hardly see what it's on the screen, it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Do not touch.
