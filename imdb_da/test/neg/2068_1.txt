As a film reviewer for a local homosexual magazine, I automatically send a boy if it happens to have a gay in it. Chicken Tikka Masala runs in the background as I write this. I gave it my distributed attention for 53 minutes before I found myself involuntarily shouting - as a Tourrettes sufferer - "This is the sh ** test file I've ever seen". We just come to the emotional climax where the son gives some to come out to his father at his wedding. Dad seems to take it quite well. An attempt at honor to kill at this time would at least have lived the film a bit. And made it more fun. <br /> <br /> I especially liked Beautiful Thing, but at least I could see why other people did. It was made with some professionalism and I seem to remember it had at least a few good lines. The lack of humor in this movie is quite astounding - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognizable jokes. The closest movie was fun (at least in its first 53 minutes), the subtitle comment that was delivered to the fat, non-attractive female leader "Look at her with her legs wide open - she's like the Mersey tunnel." Quite unclear and I didn't blow a smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who might work in a chip shop) enjoying it. <br /> <br /> I could imagine it being a lottery-funded cruelty. If not, I can at least consolidate myself with the backers losing a significant amount of money, as even a low-budget British movie will still put a few million back. Seriously, if I met the most beautiful blocks in the world and by going back to his place to make sweet love, I found a copy of this in his DVD collection ("Man, I love this movie") him in the nuts and go straight away. And this from someone who has gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love. <br /> <br /> Oh, Lord, I hate this movie.
