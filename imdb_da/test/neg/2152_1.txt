I simply can't believe the people who made and performed in this movie really took it seriously. The sketches on the SNL look more real. Everything was ridiculously false. The cool shootings, the ridiculous fist battles, the dialogue, the sappy background music and even Bo's blind eye. Had it been billed as a comedy, it would still have been more reasonable, but it would still be bad. I can only see this as "entertainment" if you get a room full of stony college kids who see it as the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you saw on Blazing Saddles that Mongo knocked down the horse or the old lady gettinf stomach. Now imagine that the manufacturer wants you to take these scenes seriously and you are given this disaster.
