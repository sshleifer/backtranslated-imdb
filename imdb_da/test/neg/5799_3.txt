I have to say that I was very excited about this movie before I rented it as an Adam Sandler's "Happy Madison" production, and I usually attract the kind of stupid humor. There were a few fun moments. at the start of the movie, but this movie lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many movie theaters are not realistic, can still be quite fun, but this movie was unrealistic and not fun at all. The play was terrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot had no meaning at all. I can't get over the fact that 3 classic older ladies would work for such poor writing themselves. Overall, I was very impressed with this movie and I do not recommend wasting 5 bucks to rent it.
