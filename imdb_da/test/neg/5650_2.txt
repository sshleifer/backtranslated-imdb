Well, I got this movie based on the very high score here (7.1 now) and some of the good reviews. Normally, IMDb is a good guide when it comes to scoring, but in this case I was very deceived. <br /> <br /> The film is a contemporary detective story with Vinnie Jones as investigator journalist examining the death of a construction work. Mixed with this is a built-up Dickens novel (called The Riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. Both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It could have been, but this movie fails terribly in a number of areas: 1) Action. Mediocre at best, but it can be seen. Not worse than your average British sitcom, but for a movie you expect a little better. Especially with a score of over 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply horrible, it distracts, and it is annoying. Especially pub music and the music that plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) History. This is a great joke. There are gaping plot holes everywhere, and even the compulsory love story is so unrealistic that it is almost fun. Moreover, without going into any details I can say that the end is absurd and one of the worst pieces of this year's plays and history. 4) Camera work. At times, the camera's positions and views are distracting and make absolutely no sense to the "story". <br /> <br /> I'm a bit of a movie fanatic and watch an average of 1 to 2 movies a day, but this is easily the worst movie I've seen in months. Don't waste your money or your time on this nonsense.
