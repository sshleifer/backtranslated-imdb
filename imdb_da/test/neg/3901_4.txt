Don't be fooled by the other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive selection of talents, the material they present offers much to be desired. Night King Cole's 3 songs are rather paralyzed and not even close to his later efforts, though he impresses with his piano play. 'Moms' Mabley is not fun, even though I remember her as a very entertaining talk show from my youth. In fact, the best performances are from a couple of cool guys who impress with a lively tapestry and a Four Top takeoff, and the jazz band itself, especially in the bassist song. The printout itself is pretty poor quality and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is completely wasted in the wraparound plot.
