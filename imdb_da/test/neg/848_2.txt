1. watched 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly, sex-filled champion and slave has too many intimate relations movies. This movie seemed to be more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story about the flesh. Laughable dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I saw with ridiculous ending, trying to give an anti-slave statement (or should I say a line). What a waste of time for everyone who sees this garbage can.
