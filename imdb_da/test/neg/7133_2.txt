People can say I'm tough, but I can't help it. The movie is so bad I was completely stunned. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. It was heavily exaggerated and silly, but this, despite the scary scenes, has a serious predicament history. They actually went deep into investigating Kayako's past and found out that she had a mother (who miraculously speaks English), who was an exorcist and "fed" evil spirits to her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. Okay, it started with Kayako, who was a regular housewife who had a deal with some blocks and got herself dead. This part is still OK. Because of this rage, she became a devoted spirit, killing anyone coming into her house. Acceotable. Now, her killing began to stretch a little, where she actually had the opportunity to travel throughout Tokyo to just end her victims. (Her victims traveled, weren't they?) This hit me hard. Now, if a ghost could actually do such a thing as traveling through a country without paying public transport rates, I would not mind being. Ask someone to kill me so * snorts *. And to crown things all the way up, it is the ghost that was once depicted as a very revengeful (in Ju-on: Grudten, which was far better than this garbage) now depicted as a joke that really enjoys itself and felt that it is her mission to end people. Things got worse (for me the viewer) when the ghost came in the form of big hair strings. I think, ??? If a ghost had such power, I'm seriously bad to be one. I have never really seen movies that portray ghosts as MONSTERS because they are not. The overall results are simply bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better story and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
