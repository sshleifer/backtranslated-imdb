So I give it a star of true quality, but I would give it an eight and a half for pure pleasure. An incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller, "Young Warriors", is just the kind of bad movie that you usually hope to find when jumping around in video fringe, yet rarely does it. It starts with about half an hour of crazy heihinx, sex jokes and juvenile shenanigans (including an olive in martini joke to be seen not to be believed). Then the protagonist's younger sister is violently beaten by a bunch of black cyclists (an indecent scene that prevents me from giving this a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not entertainment!), And the protagonist gets the rest of his sex brothers to help him With an attempt to clean up the city, find the responsible cyclists and kill some little criminals they run along the way. <br /> <br /> It's fun and fun, except for the very unpleasant rape scene, and is vital to any serious bad movie fan. Believe in me - I've spent my time on these things, and that's one of the best. The highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a nice shot-mo shootout in a winding bar (with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot out, it's pretty impressive), a couple of decent slumbering actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine) , a couple of semi-famous recognizable faces (Lynda Day George, scream queen Linnea Quigley) and a few relatives of famous people (Chuck Norris brother Mike, Van Patten clan member James). It even has one of the big "What have we become?" Write Moral Lesson Conclusions, although the turning point comes when the Vigilante Fratboys gun down a couple of children robs a store with a toy gun. I have always wondered why it was the catalyst that made the hero think; Whether they were kids and not curing criminals, and whether they had a real gun or not, they were still stealing a store, as far as I can tell, just another work well done for our vigilante frat boys, right? Wonderful things. Highly recommended, just don't blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself.
