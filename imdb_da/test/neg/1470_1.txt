This is an Emperor's New Clothes situation. Someone has to say "It's not a fun and original, etc. (movies, etc.) Movie, it's a inferior movie. Don't waste your money on it." The movie is trashy, and the people in it are embarrassingly subordinate to the garbage bin. They are all too realistic only to themselves. They have no lines, they are not acting. The American dream is not to create shoddy no-quality movies or any other foam and of no quality; It is to achieve something of quality and thus success. Only people who are desperate to praise any movie not made in Hollywood (it may not have been made in Hollywood, can it?) Would try to impose any kind of quality on this movie. It's worse than "Ed Woods", another movie about a movie maker without standards. These movies should not have been made and you should not see "American Movie."
