The notoriety of being "brought to you by the digital effects team behind the Independence Day", Coronado is even more a spectacular failure from being equated with ID4. This ridiculous mess of a movie starts with a brainless premise and goes all the way down from there. A wealthy, soon to be married couple in Beverly Hills, are the subjects of this idiotic story. Claire's fiancé has embarked on a business trip just around Christmas, so she decides to spontaneously fly to Switzerland to spend their holidays together. I especially love that her original reason for going was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need. She grabbed them and shouted at him as he drove away and concluded that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet than to call her cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in such a cavern as theirs was unaware of the existence of cell phones. <br /> <br /> So, until then, the movie is incredibly bad, but check this out, THIS is where it starts to get bad! She comes to Switzerland, and when she can't find her husband, she gets some cake and calls her friend to cheat on how unfair it is. This woman is not an action hero and she is DEFINITELY not a German Indiana Jones to cry out loud. She is an overgrown cheerleader, a spoiled sorority girl whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels out of the ground when she gets drunk enough to wander on the lawn during a wine and cheese feast on the bluffs. <br /> <br /> She gets a hint that her fiancé is in South America, so she, like, flies there to get him. Once here, this moron thinks that she herself will go into the jungle, sniff the enemy base and save her poor helpless girlfriend. She laughs at a comment about the danger of getting in there, then freaks out later because she finds out there are fighting going on. "You've never said anything about battle!" There is a point where Claire and some journalists she met are driving this large truck over a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and a hundred meters above and suspended by two at four. Literally. There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with yarn, and these morons decide to run over it. It not only crumbles under the weight of the truck, but Claire manages to drop it and drops hundreds of feet and lands on the back of the low river below. Later she remembers the event and laughs at it, oh maybe it was only a hundred. At least she didn't force chewing gum on her fingers. What is really sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to unleash a terrible performance out of the extremely talented John Rhys-Davies, a REAL Indiana Jones veteran. There is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the movie, where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we first meet him, has such a clear accent that he rolls his r that he thinks he is in a ruffles commercially, he speaks like a guy, they pulled off the streets of Venice Beach. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The special effects are insignificant. The team that brought you the Independence Day was just about to go through the moves by throwing together some dull and blue screens I have to believe because they just had nothing better to do. The story is amazingly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, as many other IMDb users mention as the only reason to watch the movie, does not make the slightest effort in her performance. Perhaps she thought that the digital effects team behind Independence Day could overlay some meaning in this mess. <br /> <br /> And considering how far they've fallen, they might have thought they could. <br /> <br /> At least they could have tried.
