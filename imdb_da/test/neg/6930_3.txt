This film is about the frustrations of filmmaking. It definitely frustrated me with its endless boredom. The setting is an attractive Spanish seaside resort with its usual large casting. The script is very poorly written, or maybe there was no script. Just everyone ad lib. <br /> <br /> A much better film about the frustrations of filmmaking is Francois Truffaut's "Day for Night" made in 1973. It shows all the delays and how the cast can celebrate itself in an exciting way. It doesn't need the viewer, and you get sympathy for the director, who somehow has to finish the movie.
