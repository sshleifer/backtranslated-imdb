There is a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. Considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very brave movie about transvestites that solves the problem quite seriously and sympathetically (and offers the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and tries very hard not to stereotype. The film makes clear that transvestites are not homosexual and that, apart from wearing women's clothing, they lead a relatively normal life. It's about the pain of not being accepted into society - the plot is about a police officer (Lyle Talbot) who is desperately trying to understand the problem because of a transvestit's recent suicide. So you have to give everyone involved in this movie credit to take such a controversial (in connection with the 1953) issue. <br /> <br /> Having said all that, I'm sorry to say that this movie is horrible. To try to portray Glen / Glenda's (Edward D. Wood) pain, the film falls into the silly (and sometimes surprisingly - again, era-sensual) fantasies that make history very difficult to follow. The action is at best wood. None of the dialogue comes across as real; the actors look and sound as people read speeches written by others. And - worst of all - there was no point in having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was one of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor took on in the last stages of his career. "Pulling the strings, pulling the strings," Lugosi's character (called the Spirit of the Credits, but really came across as a more crazy scientist) by crying. And nothing he really liked much about the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> For artistic merit, the film does not deserve much more than 1/10. But for the courage involved in just putting it out, I give it a 3/10.
