This disaster flip is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is right next to the Pacific ring (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifts will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese expression in itself for tidal wave). It is, of course, a natural precondition for a disaster image, what about Hollywood having a film market such as Armageddon, Deep Impact and recently, The Day After Tomorrow, tackling how global warming becomes a catalyst for natural disasters world. <br /> <br /> But I have to say this: The Sinking of Japan does all the aforementioned movies, resembling classics. This disaster film is a disaster and a massive one on it. To look at my watch every 10-15. Minute is a signal that the film does not interfere and feels than it had overclocked its runtime. <br /> <br /> The special effects are beautiful to look at. From satellite-shaped outer space artifacts to the vibrant recreation of every imaginable natural disaster that can hit the rising sun, the effects are star in the show. But having spectacular computer-generated graphics does not in itself make a movie tasty, like too much of a good thing just drilling. <br /> <br /> If you had seen the trailer where you were enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, in fact, these scenes are just that. There is no detail, and everything is seen from afar, in a god-like state. Things are happening just like that on the screen, with Nary attempting to dive deeper to look at problems close by. It is akin to Godzilla knock over buildings and it is as if there are no people or loss of life through the single action. Morbid as it may sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan not only suffers disaster after disaster with an extremely low mortality rate, not when the filmmakers release chaos on such an epic scale. Try weaving a romance into the movie, it stood out like a tender thumb. There are many signs in the movie, but each one lacks genuine characteristics or humanity and resembles wandering zombies without expression, without feeling and absolutely very stiff and convincing. The heroes get stuck in generic control rooms that issue statements, instructions, and forms, and respond to incidents, as if it were a computer game, all of which were decided at the touch of a button. These are signs you don't care about. <br /> <br /> If I might just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are amazing effects, there is at least an attempt to give a microscopic display of the whole disaster from the views of different individuals. And infused inside are lots of action sequences, big as the disasters themselves and little ones focusing on the human spirit's triumph which makes it relatively convincing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one for sinking and tanking, hopefully going through a short and quick death at the local cashier's office to make room for better things.
