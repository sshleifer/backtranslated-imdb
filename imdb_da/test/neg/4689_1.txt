What a horrible movie this was! I made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters to the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue from the film differs from the main story so much that your head will explode out of anger. Many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber something somewhat irrelevant to the plot and / or something that could say in less time. The camera's work is shaken and grainy. It seemed that Mr. Milligan needed to take his finger out of the zoom button! I also noticed that at some points in this movie, Andy had seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera. The clips between scenes were jumping and not flowing. The murder scenes were nothing special - incredible and ridiculously false. Hardly anything like the title suggests. This movie runs about 1 hour and 20 minutes, and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute TOTAL of the entire movie - if that. What a miserable piece of waste this movie was. Indeed, Andy Milligan is probably one of the worst leaders to plague humanity with its talented leadership and camera work. Usually I can do it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS, I can't. I'm just angry, I wasted an hour and a half in my life and looked at this (what I wouldn't do to get it back). Take my suggestion and DO NOT see this movie unless you plan to fall asleep. TERRIBLE.
