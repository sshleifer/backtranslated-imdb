St. Francisville Experiment claims that "this is not a walk in the woods", a direct blow to the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch turned out to be a movie that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, St. The Francisville experiment is the patience of the viewer. But one has to say that this is intended to be a class classic. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoiler is coming !! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a local theater where the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor talked about the movie. Should anyone like to watch this movie without knowing the upcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who cannot resist, read on my friends and everyone should know. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather uninteresting ghost stories that he claims is true, informed the audience at this video show that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know ... He informed us that all the scary discoveries the participants got were all staged and predetermined by the film's producers. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (note, I didn't say well ...). One of the participants is actually a special designer on the ER. <br /> <br /> What irritates me about this movie is that it proclaims that everything is true. It gently tries to exaggerate The Blair Witch Project by claiming it is true while Blair Witch was a hoax. The great thing is that no one could believe this movie for a moment. Filled with horrible acting and hilarious lines that "surround you with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", St. Francisville Experiment belongs to midnight movie everywhere so the audience can properly pick, boo, jeer and chant "I love the ghosts!" <br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising. Real stories aren't recorded with staged special effects that look as if the Boy Scouts neighborhood troop is creating a haunted house. From the bay of the Sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) to the annoying Madison, from the "sean" which is no more than the foursome playing on a Oujia Board until the two mice are under a bed, The St . Francisville Experiement is an embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing in the nearest paper compactor or advertise it as it really should be: "St. Francisville Experiment: A comic look, how not to make a movie".
