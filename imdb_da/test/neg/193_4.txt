hair, the film based on broadway hit, fails to achieve any redeemable film properties. You can't really take the game and make it a movie. If you are so tempted by the rock music to watch this movie, it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show. worse than watching sitcom reruns. musical failure, and cannot believe others have rated it so high.
