I remember watching this movie when I was about 10, one of my friends had it. At that time, it was just a movie when I was about 10ish and just thought of it as another action movie. <br /> <br /> Looking back now as a full movie, this is a shockingly bad movie. Anyone who produced this movie, I'm sure I had a short Hollywood career. Although the main actor seems to have made a few movies according to IMDb, although I haven't seen anything and not really remembering him too much. At least just to say that this movie is really bad, in every way it could be. I would love to see it again though: oD
