If this movie had a point, I never found it. A very depressing movie allegedly about the final evacuation of residents living in a dam on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no actual Northfork River in Montana. There are several North Forks, but they are branches of other rivers that are divided into north and south forks. <br /> <br /> The movie's movie is a coffin that bubbles to the surface of the lake, but the scene is never tied into history, and the viewer leaves to speculate on its importance. But there is much left to the viewer's speculation in the film. Another example is when a team of dungeons responsible for evacuating the residents arrives at the women's district, leaving another group of people. Some comments that are almost inaudible are made about these people, who do not make sense, and there is no follow-up in the film to explain it. <br /> <br /> The movie has been slaughtered in several stories, and the film continues to shift back and forth between stories that are quite confusing. And the stories are weird. In one of them, residents of a property refuse to be evacuated because they live in a home built like Noah's Ark. <br /> <br /> Another pointless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he shares his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If anyone can find out what the ghost story was about, the author must have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> Nature was sharp and the sun never shines. There are snow-covered mountains in the distance. I suppose the purpose was to set the mood. The time period is determined by the fact that the evacuators all drove Ford sedans from the 1946-48 era, although the events would have taken place in 1955. The action was mediocre. When I saw billing for this movie, it said Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she were, I didn't recognize her, but I suppose she was a ghost lady.
