Again, like many other TV shows, a particular actor / actress has pulled into the limelight, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, built up his reputation in previous films / series (especially by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider. She is now the star of show, gets to sing the soundtrack (which she did not write and thus gain even more fame from it). Wonderful? It creates so much imbalance in popularity over her other co-stars, especially Nathan Kress, who is constantly squeezed into smaller rolls in each episode except iDont will fight. Cosgrove's music would never have met the cards without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers as if you are now and staying my baby. Let's not forget that she lip sync / sings her song also live. Is this how you create a vocalist today? <br /> <br /> Back to the show, Cosgrove reveals more physically by performing scenes in a bikini, hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many g Bras and seen in many cases (but not by the other actresses). Wedgies are mentioned, briefs have been mentioned once. And let's not forget "Oh My God" a phrase (are any of the manuscripts / actors Christian?) Permitted that the show is not meant to be just for children, I am surprised by the many names of the female underwear, especially in the first episode where the term "nice breasts" was mentioned. I'm not sure children would refrain from saying it at home / in school afterwards. <br /> <br /> I don't mind mentioning or showing female underwear (which girls will wear), but for a Nickelodeon show, those responsible should have realized that children would be exposed to such things. I doubt other Nickelodeon shows have such content in them. As mentioned, other reviews, the lattice track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts - for example, when the Sam sign is crying, how is Earth a time to laugh? It distracts people from getting the joke and used almost in every sentence. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Cosgrove is the star's exhibitor and thus gets the greatest fame and support from the talented fans who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http: // www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star in the show, but she is facing competition from Cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs Cosgrove's covers). As mentioned, the third co-star Nathan Kress is the least noted of the party. He is portrayed as an atypical boy suffering from bullying by a girl and other boys, but somehow a wizard of technology. His height in the early episodes makes him a sweet actor, but uncommonly given his character's crush on Carly / Cosgrove. In addition to that, Kress does not enter the music industry, and as Cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, Kress falls behind. I bet he is least paid by all three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the content is of course fictional, but also wondering how it fits a comedy series at certain times (so the Laughter track is used). It also contains several continuity errors (how can your dad be and air force colonel on a submarine? US Special Forces have their own branches, and the Air Force doesn't use submarines in the US - it's for packs). A unique feature is to allow viewers to submit their own videos to appear during or after the episodes, but the videos somehow do not follow the theme of comedy. Once again it is a show It is riddled with mention of the female undergarments, skin exposure and over used slats. It's a series that promotes a teenage actress so far into the audience, so her songs / actions are exaggeratedly supported by her fans and leaves her co-stars behind.
