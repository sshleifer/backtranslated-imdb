FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a story that fits the mood of the West's suspicion of Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a creepy guy like the Ruski president who wants to return to the country - not so much to Stalin's communism but more to Hitler fascism. In fact, his political manifesto could have come directly out of Mein Kampf instead of Marx. And the wage has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the Russian Federation's ethnic cleansing paw. US mercenaries connive with Russian Prez to realize his fanatic, genocidal dream, but then go into Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze ... and, well, things get really down and dirty. He is a former US operations-driven Jason Monk who is attracted to the British government to see what the Russians are capable of. As a corny sidebar, Swayze has character who is not Monk (!), Had a Russian beauty Elena (played by beautiful Marta Kondova) on her previous missions to the former Communist state. Hardman Swayze does an acceptable job of defeating the evil Russians. But the young unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the girl as her nubile 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena, who helps father eradicate the terror that threatens her beloved mother Russia.
