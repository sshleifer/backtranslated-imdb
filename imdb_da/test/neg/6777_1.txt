I saw this cartoon accidentally on TV one night, as I couldn't get to bed. It didn't help at least. I found myself staring up into the ceiling and trying to forget that face. I could very pleasantly never see this cartoon again simply because of that face. <br /> <br /> Now, don't make me wrong - I love adventure and nursery rhymes as much as anyone. But this twisted and scary reproduction is simply disturbing. It's mainly the horrible laugh and the exaggerated features that fear me, and I still have nightmares because of it. I urge you not to let your children see this. It's far, far too scary. Please, I ask, keep it away.
