I've just been to the cinema in the city of Prague, watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroic <br /> <br /> style. Not because of the high-profile star that reminds me that most <br /> <br /> of the high-star French films are usually pathetic. But just <br /> <br /> because there are not so many movies in my French mother tongue in a <br /> <br /> city like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau's <br /> <br /> Cyrano. Then I decided to write this little comment because I believe. <br /> <br /> I really don't agree with the comment's main stream on this movie on imdb. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The movie just looks like the poster. The <br /> <br /> characters are as stupid as they look. For a while, I thought Adjani would be like a caricature - just a fun character <br /> <br /> you can laugh at. No she is not! For example, when she decides to tell you <br /> <br /> Depardieu is the one who murdered the fat she killed on <br /> <br /> the start of the movie, then the violins come in a big bold pathetic <br /> <br /> music that should make you cry and realize that Adajani character is a deeper person she looks like. Maybe it was humor on the 10th level <br /> <br /> but I'm sorry, my sense of humor isn't that high! If I want to <br /> <br /> see some fun French movie on World War II again I see La Grande <br /> <br /> Vadrouille! It's finally more fun! I also read on imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine does a good performance in this movie. I must <br /> <br /> say I have never seen such a bad play! (Now I've never seen any Ed <br /> <br /> Woods movie). Nevertheless, the film is well filmed with many good <br /> <br /> (very expensive) scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morning <br /> <br /> when the German army comes to Paris or when the refugees settle down < br /> <br /> on a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker, but <br /> <br /> he does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. He <br /> <br /> hadn't written the dialogues! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
