OK, we have 4 electrician electricians who find a mini nuclear reactor, turn it in and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe that managed to slip through a couple of her family to take over the earth, but unfortunately she is the only one left? If so, why didn't the rest of mankind come together and chase her. Also, what happened to the military, in no way could a few billion plus ammunition be used up and why hide in a basement as there were many more safe places available. Also not a dig on city workers, but how did they know what a mini-nuke reactor looked like, and how if they didn't have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the rift? Sorry, but there was nothing like the movie
