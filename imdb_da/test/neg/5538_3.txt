Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his friend Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall, UK, by his childhood wealthy friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha is in love with Daniel, who is an ambiguous man about his sentimental life. While it is alone in the house, there are fun things, and Laura is scared and scared. When Laura meets the old crazy priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the road, she immediately advised to leave the house when the evil lived there. But the couple remains and faces tragic consequences. What a messy script and horrible and cheesy movie, this "Devil's Harvest" is! The cinematography and camera work is not bad, but Chris John's and Carol Kentish's amateur performances and James Shanks' direction along with the horrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this movie the worst I have ever seen in genre. I have occasionally seen in YouTube a pair of shorts from cinema college that are better and better than the pointless and terrible "Devil's Harvest". In the end, it's not a scary movie, but a scream of movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Colheita do Diabo" ("The Devil's Harvest")
