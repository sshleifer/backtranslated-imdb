I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up. The protagonist is completely clueless and amazingly unsympathetic, but there is no humor in his blundering. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the screenwriter draws the old "There is only one room in the hotel, you have to share a room with a beautiful girl" stunt. Come on, at least you can let them develop their relationship a little first. See "It happened one night" to see how to do it right - or some thousand movies since then. <br /> <br /> The play is consistently triple, and the improvised dialogue should have been left behind the floor room. It does not suffer at all, even if the film telegraphs the destination of the relationship from the moment Greta is introduced. <br /> <br /> The first song on the board is mildly fun but poorly sung. The rest of the songs (to be fair, I've only heard them in the first half hour) are just meaningless and awful. Most singers are painfully out of tune, but not in any appropriate sense of humor.
