OK, just what HELLEN is all this should mean ??? Halloween 6 (let's just call it, okay?) Is undoubtedly the most CONFUSING movie in the series (and from what I've heard, the original "producers cut" doesn't sound like it makes anything less confusing than the "official" edition). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is not a really bad movie that some have said. It has its scary scenes and some pretty intense moments - it just doesn't make sense! Don't tell me that Michael was "manipulated" from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah. It was bad enough when they became Michael's brother Jamie Lee Curtis (just as they had an excuse to keep her in the other movie) - it's too much. It seems to be another case of the film's creators trying to be "too clever" by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all. Bad move, guys. We're not looking for an explanation of why Michael is killing, so please don't try to feed us this crap. Show me Michael looks threatening and kills a lot of people. Show me Dr. Loomis tries to track him down and always comes up short. Don't waste (it turned out to be) the last performance of Donald Pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way) that Michael was "created" by some cult of hell and that his "seed" will be passed on to another and ... Oh, brother. Halloween 6 has its moments, don't make me wrong, and we all know that there have been fewer worse followers than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) So get what you can get out of it (the scene towards the end of the movie with Michael charger Down a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the bolt bolt plot. Hopefully someday, we can all see the producer's cut and maybe get the chance to make (little) more sense of all this. Until then, this must do ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
