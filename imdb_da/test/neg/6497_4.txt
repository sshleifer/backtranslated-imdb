I saw this ego-centric "effort" to achieve a movie of "epic" status in the company of several native Russian family members. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from Mikhalkov worship to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of "Canal +" money, put some of it in his (and others) pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of movie students. I figured at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. There is no way that the same instructor is responsible for these different scenes. Contrast these to yourself: <br /> <br /> · Cadets shoe with a dog. · Train station scene (goodbye to Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panoramic photos. <br /> <br /> · Ormond speaks through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · First attempt at the Grand Duke and later hunting scenes to get Andrei back to sing in Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing sequence <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than superman. He learns about his transfer delayed, she comes all the way across Moscow in a minute to say goodbye to Andrei. <br /> <br /> The Russian natives believed that the impression of Russian life was "caricature" and not history. They called it "tourist postcard" Russia. <br /> <br /> They were all proud that a Russian director / producer / fixer has managed to break into "big time" and be able to waste over $ 30 million of other people's money while you Perhaps a little bit of local pockets under the film. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think", you've seen Russia, go see this movie. Drink some coffee before you go.
