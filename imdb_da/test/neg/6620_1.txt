There is a reason. The chairman of the board got a 2 (which is too high) this movie flattened out is one of the worst movies of all time and I've seen my share of rat movies. Chairman of the Board are two of the most annoying actors / people today, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top is just no more fun and was not in this piece of waste. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just see "According to Jim" and you will see a good example of what I am talking about. The chairman got a 1 from me because it's low as you can go, it's so bad. I'm a bit shocked that this piece of junk is not on the IMdb bottom 100 somewhere, I want to put this in the top 5 on that list, but it works slowly down there.
