I'm so glad I only got this movie for $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt about it. I have seen this for a while and finally I saw it for sale. I grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment. This movie sucked. I've heard people talk about how horror and violence this movie is. It's really not so gory or violent. I have seen it three times and I think I have wasted enough of my life on this. The demons get a point to be unique and a little cold at times. Gender gets a point as it is almost non-stop. The old man gets half a point of being horny and still has sex drive. And the protagonist (whose name I've deleted from my mind) gets a half point for the cool design of his gun. I saw great connections between this movie and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style of animation, it's obvious because of the instructor, both have lame soundtracks that suck like the antichrist, and both have horrible endings. Avoid this movie unless you are in anime sex.
