Compared to director Kevin Connor's later ARAB ADVENTURE, this is a masterpiece. But that doesn't say much. In fact, in the core of the earth is a silly fantasy adventure where Peter Cushing - who seems to be on something strong - and another actor (who I don't know) uses a huge excavator called "Iron Mole" digging their way down to the core of the earth - to find out that the interior of the earth is pink and populated by monkey-like creatures that have slaves man. There is also a huge bird that controls the monkeys using telepathy, and we see it blinking the eyes in close-up throughout the film. Most importantly, Cushing and what's his name also come across the lovely Caroline Munro in the underground caves. And here's what I really have against the little girl: Why oh why is it that when Munro is in a movie, she only gets about. 5 minute screen time? IN THE SPY, LOVED ME, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD - she's always in the background! How could Kevin Connor think we'd rather listen to Peter Cushing's fake accent and look at a ridiculous monkey man whose voice sounds like a scratched CD than glance at the beautiful Munro? I do not understand it. Please, someone is leading a movie where this British brunette is always on the screen!
