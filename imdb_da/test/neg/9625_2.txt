Well, that was probably a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't make me wrong: When it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean can be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look he can do with just a few hard-line pencil lines makes the effort of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher as they are: hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in appearance comics, movies, even magazine ads, borrowing the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It is undesirable. Complete junk. The story of Neil Gaiman is unfortunately exactly what Gaiman has given us ever since, for the first time, he released Clive Barker: a pseudo-mythical, blown-over dream cabinet, populated by characters that have titles in all capital letters rather than names. Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, feeling or empathy from everyone involved. People do spicy postulates and speak in puzzles that remember what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have sounded like Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating blow halfway through his composition. Really, Gaiman, get over yourself. You are not a prophet. You're a bag. <br /> <br /> McKean's management doesn't help - his pacing is poor and takes half an hour to actually tear up the main picaresque plot and then just give an interrupted sequence of events, none of them given any weight. The monsters do not threaten because they are not foreshadowed, simply thrown on the screen. The reason does not involve, because we are not very concerned about the rancid small protagonists. Half of the dialogue, mumbled into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks, is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures are beautiful and I'm sure the fanboys will lick it up. Pity. Think of the amount of really good work that McKean could have produced if he hadn't been stuck with this lame project. <br /> <br /> Degree: D / D-
