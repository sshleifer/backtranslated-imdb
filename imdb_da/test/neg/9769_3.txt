I will be generous here and give it a 3 only because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. That said, this movie was pretty bad. It's as if they started with almost no script, and the director just told the actors to stare each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it. And Billy D. Williams looked as though he'd rather be anywhere but in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I could write a script better than dislodge for this movie and I'm not a writer. There is one thing I have seen mentioned through reviews and bulletin boards - everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around the Second World War and actually it seemed to start in the late 1950s / early 1960s 's. While the military was not separated, I am quite sure that any troops waiting on board a train will still be separated in a place like Huntsville, Al. If the beginning of the movie were to be the 1940s, Billy D, Lesley Ann & Rae Dawn would have been in the 70s and 80s instead of their mid-50s or early 60s. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you really like the actors because the story is not very interesting.
