After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most people will probably rush to get a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is too real or just get a lucky rebound from a good script. its moments but plainness of ... everything will most likely turn the viewers. But nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor, showing that he is a solid actor with significant chops; It's just a shame about the director and script. The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to observe everything that resembles normality. He finishes or gets fired from jobs in just a few minutes, just to get back in a boring pub that meets even more violent women while trying to write a non-conformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about, except that it involves "everything" (cancer, film, you, me). Hopping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a taberindefriend who is as widespread as himself, tries to discover Hank in vain what his life will hold for him. Whether he ever learns what it is is up for interpretation. Some may say that he never does, while others may argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity. Whatever the case, there is not much substance for Factotum even with Matt Dillon's good performance. The story winds through Hank's life without much thought of where to take the audience. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would have shone even brighter if he got a decent script.
