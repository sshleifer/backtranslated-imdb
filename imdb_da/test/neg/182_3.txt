Honest Young Insurance Agent Ronald Reagan (like Eric Gregg) is optimistic but poor. His wife, scheming Sheila Bromley (like Nona Gregg), yearns for the finer things in life. Describing himself as "not weighted with tons of justice", Mrs. Bromley begins to spend more money than Mr Reagan serves. Bromley gets the finer things in life, but puts the couple in debt. Bromley is a fun shrew. Handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as perky clerk Gloria Blondell (like Patricia Carmody); but he does not reject himself. To pay the bills, Bromley gets confused in the insurance charge - which helps to get her husband fired. An unemployed Reagan seems to be tempted for a crime life - will he stay up or be offended? Clinton Rosemond has an unpleasant "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents will happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell
