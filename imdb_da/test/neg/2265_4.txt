I have read the book 'Scarlett' and expected a good movie the first time I saw it. I'm afraid to say I was disappointed. The film did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes I didn't like as Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made no sense to make him a bad man. The way things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett were very different, and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /> <br /> There was also much less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie than originally written in the book. The film sent the two in two opposite ways, and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there could still be love between the two. A nice movie, but I think it could certainly have been better than it was, it was more true that Alexandra Rippley's book.
