The film opens with a cult leader trying to revive a dead member with his followers who chanting for his rebirth when the sun hits them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) wholeheartedly believes in his power, and is then reprocessed to collapse with what seemed to be a heart attack. Without keeping him alive, all involved, doctors and nurses are convicted of attack by Reanhauer's demonic spirit, invading the curvy body of nurse Sherri (cattle Jill Jacobson), targeting each user her as a revenge tool. Forced against his will, without the memory of causing such damage, kills Sherri's host selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's colleague, nurse Tara (Marilyn Joi), begins a rather thriving romance with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molded), once a star football player whose mother was a voodoo practitioner. Through Marcus' knowledge, descended from mother, Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murdered all unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land) deals with her current condition and welfare. It was my first Al Adamson movie, and I have to agree with their critics that, right from this movie alone, it seems he is holding them with paper clips and Elmer glue. The animation we see the spirit takes control of Sherri, is beyond horrible and rather ridiculous. A bit of soft core nonsense as a filler, some demonic possession thrown into the mix (Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she possesses), with eerie nurse behavior (.. the three nurses focused on in the movie are all quite sexually active and free -spirited) and a little violence / gore. The film is essentially shot in small rooms with a dull dialogue from a fairly everyday throw. The sexual situations are not so hard, and Al often takes them without revealing all that much. The movie looks embarrassingly cheap and there is a lack of excitement, even though the chilling score (which sounds like something from Dark Shadows) helps a little. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (.. as nurse Beth, who seems to be a nymphomaniac, if she even wants to screw a naked patient, always complains about illnesses that he really does not have enough breast hair to declare him a Neanderthal) It is bad to see, and Adamson's storyline, though weak, is somewhat coherent (.. it seems he rarely leads movies that are). Overall, the movie looks like it costs 5 bucks, and Adamson just can't overcome the budget constraints (.. or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere because of a sometimes plodding tale and boring scenes that do a little bit of history). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not to believe that she was in possession, he is constantly moving with Peter over her. I looked at the non-classified "lost" version, which I think is the right version to look at Nurse Sherri.
