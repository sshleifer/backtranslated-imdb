When they first get there, they are not welcomed by the neighboring state who heats them to stay away from the cabin where they will be staying the week. After bothering with the old man, three hill-car lights do not even take care of their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. After asking some of the local dummies who can't speak or just don't want to answer, they finally find the cabin. After they have settled in, strange things come to the visitors, including discovering crap on their car. The man is the head of this journey. It's an idiot shoots the family dog ​​that thinks it was a killer who clapped the door and a series of deaths later in the end. Adding a church group didn't make the story better. So at the end, the idiot who survives the whole trial goes around the city carrying a shot shot. Lame. That's what this movie is.
