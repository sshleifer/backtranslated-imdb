Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notes that their waste is gone again .... there must be someone stealing it from the curb. He goes into roller blades after the trash can. When he finally comes to the dump, he is surprised to learn not only that "other people's garbage" has been stolen, but that there is a secret organizational meeting at the dump. He is determined to defeat the world's rubbish, it seems. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster visit the police station and a Chinese restaurant looking for their parents, because Joan also comes away. Will they blunder their way through their problems? This is just a stupid, stupid movie, with the culprit there being the horrible script. The books from Allard and Marshall are hysterical and only a few situations from the books end up in this movie. Arnold is actually pretty nice as Mr. Stupid and the other cast members try very, very hard to do the film work. The production values ​​are very high, where the dog and the cat belong to the stupids, which add a little to the film. But it is too nothing, since the plot is wandering and weak. Perhaps one day will take another staff by translating the very fun Allard books into the big screen. Therefore, if you love to laugh, rent something else while waiting for a new production, and at least go with the books as well. But stay away from being stupid yourself, since anyone who sees this movie at the end could hardly be called intelligent.
