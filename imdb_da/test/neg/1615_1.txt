greetings; <br /> <br /> I never thought I would see that day as I would be so disgusted with a movie that it would be a burden to finish it ... I was always a fan of horror movies, B ' C and C are included. But in this case it is difficult to describe how a movie could not qualify for any letters on that scale ... The film is centered on a poorly developed story, a mixture of folklore with a subsequent taste. And on top of that, the players' performance is doubtful. Horror B movies usually fall into two categories ... 1) A gem that was submerged and under funded 2) So bad is it fun, laughing or money back. Now this movie falls in between. I was not scared, not laughing ... So I guess if you really need to see what you could, but I recommend you not ...
