Not even the Beatles could write songs that everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is not a mop-top, he is unmatched when it comes to thought-provoking action movies. Nineties came and social platforms shifted into music and movies, the emergence of the Rapper beaten the movie star was in full swing, the play took the back seat to every man's overwhelming regional accent and transparent plays. This was one of the many ice-t movies I saw as a child and loved one, only to see them later and cringe. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with basic lives until a burning building bed gets into flames surviving a card with gold implications. I give it to Walter for quickly and neatly creating the protagonists and the location. But I am mistaken for all involved to show Lame-o performances. Ice-t and dice must have been red hot at this time, and while I have enjoyed both their career as rappers, in my opinion, they fell flat in this movie. It's about ninety minutes of a guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in several states of disbelief. Now it's a movie, it's not a documentary, so I'm not wasting my time telling all the stupid plots in this movie, but there were many, and they didn't look anywhere. I felt watching this that everyone on the set was really confused and just played things out of the cuff. There are two things I still enjoy about it, one involving a scene with a needle and the other being Sadler's huge 45 gun. The bottom line of this movie is like domino's pizza. Yes, I should eat it if I'm hungry, and I don't want cooking, but I know it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.
