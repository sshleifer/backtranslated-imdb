I have no problem with how the movie does not record New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Lived. No matter what. I lived there far enough. I don't have to watch a movie that catches the Garden State. <br /> <br /> What I'm having trouble with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy for you. We use some bullet points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie INSIDE): <br /> <br /> - Music placement was questionable and condescending. Example: Big: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "The Shins. Have you ever heard of them?" "None." "Listen to this song - it will change your life!" And then they continue to play the Shins song that was in a McDonald's advertisement. (Don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to respond to something? I love it! Hey, they should have put subtitles under different scenes that instruct us to "chuckle", "say" aaaaaw "" "cried" "feel inspired" etc.) <br /> <br /> - The scene scenes were so bad. So Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The whole movie. But no, really, example: They are in the rainforest by the ark. Big runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he's so confused!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh, how move! But wait! Here comes Sam and his friend (the annoying drug addict), and they are all SCREAM !!!! BUT WAIT !!!! OH GOD!!!! Here it comes! THE KISS !!! Far, deep !!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> - The dialogue was so poor. So Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the ark, and Sam says something like, "Hello. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss." And the guy says back, "You too." Oh ... Oh my! I never understood ... could it be? Oh my God, that's it! Great life is like ... ohmigod ... AN INFINITE ABYSS !!!! Another example: Big and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like, "Is this goodbye?" Not enough for you? OK, Largeman says something like, "This is not a period at the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipse." And guess what happens when he tries to go down the jet and go back to his life in LA. You know what? Don't guess. It's a waste of your time. <br /> <br /> It's a Grader Z Wes Anderson rip-off movie. When you're not concerned with being melodramatic and cliché, the movie uses lots of times with crazy-koky-off-kilter characters. Hi, Sam's brother ... thank you Zach Braff for including him because it really made the movie so much more structured. Also ripping off the Anderson: dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. Yesterday friends, "Vagina!" says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, "I'm sorry I said the vagina." And Sam says, "That's okay." <br /> <br /> -Inventive filmography that is not inventive but meaningless and annoying. Give me a break with the speed up / down of movies. Again, Wes Anderson makes it effective in his films. And it was done well in "Donnie Darko." But it was really pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people take X and snorter cola. Better roll out all the tricks! <br /> <br /> -You can count the good moments on one side (even if you're missing fingers). It even makes it WORTHY. The retarded quarterback thing ... Well, that was good! The little thing he (largeman) says as they are about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine) ... it was good! Oh, wait, it's about it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too sweet. But he likes. But man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you got it yet?), Too sweet, all in all. This movie is horrible. Apparently, I am outside, as this waste of time is currently rated at 8.0. Although you are looking for something really exciting and subtle and unique DO. DOES NOT. RENT. THIS. MOVIE.
