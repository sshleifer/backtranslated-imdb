I think vampire movies (usually) are evil. Although the movie itself is not so good, I still like it because it has vampires in it. But it stinks. It really gives the vampire movie a bad name. <br /> <br /> For a start, fairness really shows. I'm not usually that bothering about low-cost movies - one of my favorite all-time movies is El Mariachi, which only costs $ 7,000 - but I hate this. It's also about a junk that uses a stylish wobbling camera that gives you headaches. There is little more to say than to see this. I bought it for Â£ 1.50 as it was an ex-rental and I feel cheated out of my money even for the low price.
