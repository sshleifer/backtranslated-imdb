When I went to see this movie, it was already a forced choice since my original intention was sold out. What meant was pure terror, this movie is so bad that I could hardly bear it. The story is not worth mentioning, a gay goalie forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team, who - after discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. filled with unbearably old and overused clichés of homosexuals, the thin plot perfectly matches the inane dialogues ... it is amazing that actors such as dietmar berries or charly hübner beat their talent and time on such nonsense. 1.10
