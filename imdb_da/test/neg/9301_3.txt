This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hitman for some Russian mobsters based on Buffalo. He is also a furious alcoholic, and his job performance is falling. After falling asleep in his car during a heavy blow, his evil uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he will attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortar's assistant. If you think this does not make sense, you are not alone. It gets worse. Well it actually gets better, but not before it gets much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a master teacher despite a complete lack of training, but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to mess with him as they feel positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, though he hardly gets anything to do (his character tells us he's gay, but that doesn't mean he has any meaning). The movie throws its head into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest for Frank flounders, as the two actors have no chemistry together. Around the time she enters the picture, Frank becomes much less exciting as a character. His characterization seems to be random; There is no connection in his behavior. The comedy is low key and only intermittently fun, especially disappointing considering the comic pedigree of the cast. <br /> <br /> Problems are missing in this. The Kingsley accent is horrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian and Spanish speakers. Throughout the film, Frank tells many people that he is a hitman (including a whole AA group), but no one seems to break or will do anything about it. The movie relies on clich√© scenes to carry it through its final action, especially when Leoni is an impenetrable character chasing Frank down at the airport just when he is to board a flight back to Buffalo. Though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly becomes a total disaster and turns into complete nonsense. At the end of the film Frank celebrates a year of presence. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen "You kill me". <br /> <br /> My character: D +
