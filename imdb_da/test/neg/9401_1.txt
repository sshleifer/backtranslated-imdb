Good to make American divorce with more money than brains buy a rundown villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, while having to cope with the price, she then manages to cook delicious buffets for her workers and walk around Italy indefinitely without jobs or apparent means.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover follow this a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane seems like an unskilled clueless teenage indigenous all the way through - as a dynamic clash with her seriously failing appearance - along the way of a series of (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dives, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. Flared with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous is a lumpy and meaningless recreation of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar term was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', Norman Jewish's very great ode to Italy and romance). The 'Tuscan Sun' can be the most vacant cinema of the last decade, despite its certainly lined panoramas of Italy. Bonus negative point for the alien lover fell at the last minute to give the necessary Hollywood ends for his target audience of Oprah brainwashed housewives. Avoid at all costs, unless of course you see Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.
