You have to start worrying when you see that Michael Madsen is the leader of any movie. I will not go through the list of shame that is his movie career. <br /> <br /> I saw 45 minutes and still wasn't sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a love affair between Madsen and Argento, which was basically that Madsen insults her, threatens violence and generally treats her as dirt. She loves him on the other hand, so do not shes, then she does, she wants him, then she loves him again ...... what's wrong with you woman !!!! The script is horrible, lousy soundtrack and a meaningless aggressive and raw sexuality that I think was added to lure some viewers as the movie has little else to offer. I would have given the movie a 1, but it was just about a 2 with little excitement in the last 20 minutes. It actually answered a question in the last few minutes, but I don't want to share what I want you to suffer for the full movie I did.
