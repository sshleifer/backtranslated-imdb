This film should be one of the most boring and stupid movies Perrugorria has done. <br /> <br /> It looks like a commercial from start to finish. Â¨Director spends all the time on a tripod, it does not have tempo, rhythm. It's illogical. What a mess. You can tell what has to happen since the first 15 minutes and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ how the hell Perrugorria was shot? Are you serious? The worst scene for anyone is ever shot! <br /> <br /> ------ End of spoiler ----- <br /> Poor conducting, bad script, bad acting ... Really bad overall. I would not recommend this movie at all. It's a waste of money and time.
