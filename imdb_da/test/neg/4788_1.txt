With the abundance of repetitive and derived sitcoms interfering with fall, summer, winter and spring, it's nice to see a show that sets itself off from the party in more than one area. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' takes an unusual approach. It's not about the "daily musings of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..) or about the other boring things you see anywhere in sitcoms. The show is about this little white trash (Earl) that scratches a lottery card and scores great time. At that moment, 'Karma' took it away from him. In overtime, he learns that the unusual event was probably due to all the bad things he has done, so he sits down on a mission to correct every precedent he has ever done, and he has all his works on a paper. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent prerequisite for a sitcom. Fortunately, it landed in the right hands. The performance of the show is extremely satisfying: you get an innovative comedy that is really fun and really moving many times. You can't help falling in love with Earl's sincerity and steadfastness, Randy's simple mind, good heart and observations about life, Joy's wild, flamboyant personality and Darnell's mellow, chillin demeanor that really makes him very easy for you. <Br /> <br /> When you combine the show's innovation with its true humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a keeper. Of course, with shows like this (and the incomparable "The Office"), NBC is on something. Have they finally released a cabinet or two for quality assurance? Lets hope so. And let's hope for more quality exhibitions like these will fill line-ups; shows that both US viewers and NBC executives stop crying over the long days of NBC's golden days (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
