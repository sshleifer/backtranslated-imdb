This movie suffers from the fact that Hollywood for years had no idea how to pack Jackie Chan into the masses. His low-budget Hong Kong films were all quick kinetic thrillers, highlighting his amazing gymnastics and lightweight comedy skills. His early Hollywood movie hit him in the same movie that was packed to Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie, which requires that the character is Asian, except that he is the star. In his Hong Kong movie, Chan is never boring, with the movies being a fast-paced sequel, but "The Protector" is lifeless throughout. Danny Aiello doesn't get much to work with, and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably a result of the manuscript and the direction than how the two actors came together. Both have been better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the horrible way that Jackie Chan comes out so colorless and boring. It would first be in Canada, "Rumble in the Bronx" that West would finally find out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
