After hoo-hooing American Indian scalp number one son, the border man borders Bruce Bennett (like Daniel Boone) seems initially as he wants to be straight; But he really wants to make friends with the natives. When it provided Indian boss Lon Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) also loses number one son, it becomes more difficult to clarify misunderstandings. Apparently this was Republic Pictures' attempt to make for their "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" what Disney Studio has been successful with "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" (1955). <br /> <br /> "Dan'l Boone" sang, whistled and sung by a group of kids in a wagon, Fess Parker's Davy Crockett did not follow up on Hit Parade. Singer Faron Young (like Faron Callaway) does not perform the title song (maybe wise); He sings "Long Green Valley" and gives a good impression as a blonde girlfriend to Boone's daughter. But Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the film's most valuable player. In a cute scene, Mr. Fernández Mr. Young about the character ("Susannah") he should be in love with. <br /> <br /> **** Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10 / 5/56) Ismael Rodríguez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Faron Young, Freddy Fernandez
