The "Clubbed" campaigns project a slick looking movie based on the clubbing scene in the 1980s. What we end up with is a movie with identity problems. The subplotters end up taking over from what viewers suppose to be the main plot, so the focus on this movie is primarily about "clubbing" ending up being left in the gutter. Boxing, depression, self-suffering, gangsters, bouncers, and drug deals are all hastily stuffed into 90 odd minutes. In less than 4 times I had to check the film's lap time as the concern grew that this movie was bound to disappoint. Which club scenes we see are gentle and repetitive and offer about 3 extras dances in what can hardly be recognized as a "club" that hardly captures today's mood. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about the 80's club scene, something is in line with what "Human Traffic" did in the late 90s, forgetting "Clubbed".
