This movie sucks. It's terrible. If anyone liked it, they should get there that was investigated. Jackie Mason's character sounds like a retard. The guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucks. Although Chevy Chase was in this movie, he wasn't funny. This movie had raw and unfunny jokes and did not have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Although Jackie Mason's character had the character of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was fun! He should have returned! I don't care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should also have returned. The original Caddyshack was Murray's career performance. If he was fun in the first, he could have been fun in the other. Finally comment: I recommend this movie to ... NO !!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE SUCCESS !!!! IT HAS SUCCESS, IT SUCKS NOW AND IT NEVER SUCKS !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
