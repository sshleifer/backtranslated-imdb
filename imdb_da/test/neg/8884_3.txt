I did here, this movie was good from different people. And I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem as well as the director Milos Forman. But after watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire about it. <br /> <br /> First, the play was very below average. The performance was just not strong enough to really feel shocked at what the Inquisition did. Javier Bardem gave a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had Spanish accent. It is quite obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who I think is a very good and upcoming actress, didn't make me really dissatisfied with her being tortured. Like the movie, there was nothing to admire about her performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, who I like, gave a very average performance, just as the other actors give a boring performance. This movie was mostly about him when he plays Goya. Yet he was not what he was supposed to be to make this movie good. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to fool me. He plays King Carlos IV. See, he's good in comedies, but he plays a king who just describes the whole movie to you. The management was just awful in this movie. When a movie is a mess, there are usually two people to blame for it: the director and the author. I get the feeling that Milos Forman didn't really want his actors to put a Spanish accent on it. From the very few fighting scenes here, they all showed terrible. Also as a director he must give you a sense of shock of what the Inquisition did. After this movie, I felt I could be careless about the event. To summarize the whole thing, he badly shot the actors and misunderstood the actors. <br /> <br /> The script, which was also done by Milos Forman, was as bad or perhaps even worse than the director. There was really nothing memorable of the movie, except for one where Bardem gets the same treatment that Portman's character has been given. Secondly, the movie didn't give you the feel of the time period, and at least it could have dealt with it with a quote or two. <br /> <br /> After the end of this movie I just looked at the TV thinking ok why should I worry about any of this. I don't care and am very interested in the story, but when movies like this come up, it feels as if the producers robbed you of something good that could have been taken away from the movie. When movies are so bad, we highlight many technical errors in a movie than if it was good. Like the accents. I'm not sure people would have highlighted the lack of Spanish accents if this movie was good. <br /> <br /> Since the whole point of this review is to say, just don't see it.
