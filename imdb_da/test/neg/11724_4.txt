Don't make me wrong. I have a significant soft spot for the works of the Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you have to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to name his "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" puts a pseudonym on something. As a bit of bad movie fun, "Head of the Family" lacks enough, even though it's better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a particular talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. J. W. Perra is also quite funny as the titular monster, but for such a super-intelligent creature he makes it easy to get hoodwinked. Yes, I'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty of course .... And with a main character called Lance Bogan? Nice one guys. We didn't know the Americans knew the slang!
