There can be no worse criticism for a movie than the word BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are very fun, some "funny" movies are really bad, but being BORING means nobody will ever buy the DVD to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> It seemed like a movie using the drama class from Antartic, they were too busy and drove around to get warm instead of acting. The main player's talk is a near whisper, husky style voice, marvelous, it seemed he would seduce someone, and he didn't care who. <br /> <br /> The movie can't make money if it's boring, I hope this one dies a quick, never to be seen again, death.
