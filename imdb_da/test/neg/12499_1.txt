This movie was so bad. It was not fun at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were fun. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, a kind of wonderful, soul man, and probably one or two. Chris Kattan in his worst worst as a caretaker who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend who breaks her ankle and her dance hall goes to the sweet blonde beginner Chris has eyes on. I thought the play was really bad. I like to laugh out loud comedies, this was not one. "Not another teen movie" was not fun, but had much more fun scenes than absolutely fantastic. "Scary Movie" is suuuper fun. I always laugh when I see them, super enjoyable. This movie, not fun.
