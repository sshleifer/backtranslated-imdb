Right now I'm watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful set of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climax scene when God destroys Sheban idol and much more with the Millean thunderbirds at the moment, where Yul and Gina are completing their love. Yul does a half decent job delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like Yul is delivering his lines like Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders plays George Sanders. Due to the limited number of actions she is asked to show in this role, Gina does a good job, but while the film ends, she is completely transformed into a bother that is calming and looks like she might play in a biography of mother Teresa. I think thunderbolts will do it for you, but it's almost breathtaking how fast she tells her own belief for her new religion. The supporting players are mostly horrible, lacking in credible feelings and timing. The usual big battle scenes that passed for huge dances in 1959, and an orchestra sprayed lots of trumpet calls behind a huge choir singing many "Ahs", but none of the topnotch Hollywood quality. The final sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is at the ridiculously low skill level of a junior high school play. The movie is a big piece of eye so, but not much more.
