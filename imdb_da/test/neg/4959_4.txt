From the budget, 2.5m CAD is not so much when looking at the animatronics, the puppetry in this movie, which alone is the cause of 9 weeks of shooting. I was really eager to watch this movie and had hoped to catch it when it came out but got it on DVD recently. My main problem is that it's just fun, it's better than Tenacious D, who doesn't have a funny leg in his body. But this was a really disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a very strong physical performer but his acting sucks! Rachel Skarsten gives what is possibly one of the most annoying and no fun shows I've ever seen. The only really big star in this is David Scott, whose artwork for monsters is fab! His special effects are the main reason why this movie is worth watching, loved Cyclops and Troll, and and Prof Monster was right out of the Henson library. <br /> <br /> If you see this, it won't be the biggest waste of time, but if you're looking to see this a great Horror Comedy Skirt ... don't bother.
