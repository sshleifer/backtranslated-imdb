Being a great Laura Gemser fan, I picked this up at a rental center just to see another Emanual movie. Boy, did I make a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUAL IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but it's the only connection to Emanuelle. Here Laura plays "Laura" (original, huh?) A beautiful supermodel that goes to visit her wealthy friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In tow she is a hollow photographer Carlo (a scary Gabriele Tinti) and a blond woman who has never been named. Also in Pia's mansion is Horatio (the sexy but stupid Al Cliver), a mystery that speaks nothing but nonsense. Arriving at the weekend, Pia's two daughters are a short-haired lesbian and the other a brunette. Lots of sex is implied, but hardly shown. A wonderful actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion. Laura has sex with lesbian, lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and blonde have sex with Horatio by an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks the goat's blood and is obsessed with an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rapes Laura. It all happens with so little flair that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Far from erotic looks even the actors themselves are bored during their sex scenes. Considering there were two famous couples in this movie (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of available sex scenes is inadmissible. Instead, a movie offering a first-class Eurocult cast and never delivering the goods will piss out all viewers except the hardcore Laura Gemser completist. Otherwise, remove EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
