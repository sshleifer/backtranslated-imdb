I saw that this movie came out and couldn't wait to see it. I must say I was very disappointed with it. This would have been better as a mini-series. The whole show seemed very rushed. They didn't explain very clearly things. At the end they showed John Paul II, alive and well, and the next scene he was dead. Never any explanation of what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC dropped the ball great time on something that could have been good. Overall, I think this movie was a blur. It looked like a drowning monkey jumping around from one point in John Paul's life to another point, and never explained how or why things happened. As when his elder brother left, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor, and so he left home. Even when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor, and that is it. I was very disappointed with the whole movie.
