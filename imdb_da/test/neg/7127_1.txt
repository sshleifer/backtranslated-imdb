This movie was complete tripe. Possibly it is actually a pollution. The subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake is not where to look. Sarah Michelle Gellar gets nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but she is still the best performance in this movie and her death is the best thing about it, even though she deserved a better death. Its signs of very poor writing and management. I guess she did this movie to end the connection with it as her nonsense. <br /> <br /> Not scary. Not tense. Not funny. It makes no sense at all. And as mentioned above, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only reasonable performance out of the whole cast.
