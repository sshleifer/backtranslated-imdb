OMG, what has Disney done at the last minute .. most of their new shows really suck. The success of Zach and Cody is pretty good, but others show up as Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place sucks and can't be packed. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sadie is just beyond stupid and stupid. Its about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. It's all annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret, who thinks she is the most popular girl in school and thinks she is so beautiful ... it is just beyond awful. I hate all the seasons in this show, it's just terrible in every way (the first season was better though). <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life, you wouldn't see this shot, its painful and stupid
