There was a time when Michael Jackson was honored as Pop of Pop. Then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracted wasps. Finally, it is now the time we really feel sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is another reason. I promised a rabid Michael Jackson fan to see it with her. You know the type of fan - one who tells him - or himself likes everything that the object of love ever did. As she watched this movie as she had seen twice already, I realized how far this fandom goes. Probably far enough to judge this movie over a 1/10 that some people miraculously did. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to be a parody of many other films and series, especially Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails at all levels. The action does not save the horrible story, the film has the quality of an often played video tape. The special effects were better done in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not now make this film: with aluminum foil). All this would be fun if the movie managed to be good, fun. Unfortunately, it is not. It hurts to see this. <br /> <br /> And there's Michael Jackson's look in this garbage. He appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message and manages to get across the cell phone like Jabba Hutt and as serious as a 4 year old. Just as I was thinking "who is the horrible person who enticed this poor man to join this movie and once again make a total fool of himself", I finally reached the final credits and discovered that the film was actually partially shot Jackson's Neverland Ranch. In other words: He. Like. The. <br /> <br /> This movie, and Jackson's commitment to it, is really disturbing. Don't look at it even for "haha, a movie in the IMDb Bottom 100" effect. Or be warned.
