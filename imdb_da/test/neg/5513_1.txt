A Roger Corman rip-off overall for what seems to be almost zero budget. All the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars", and I suppose a lot of props, costumes and sets were also recycled from other sources. The story seems to be written around these elements, so it's not a movie as much as it is a recycling project. Triple wager "Star Wars" junk was not necessary so or now.
