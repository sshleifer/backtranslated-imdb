The man kills bears. The man becomes bear. Man / bear meets bear. Man / bear remains man / bear after meeting bear. The end. Seriously, it's all plotted for this movie. Yes, I simplified it to an extreme, but you get the picture. I just wished I might not have seen it. <br /> <br /> The "man / bear" referred to is an Indian who kills a mother of a cub. And even though it may touch, it certainly lacks the real potential potential conflict between the two parties. Plus, there was some abuse of the two moose in the movie. But it is out of the point. <br /> <br /> Overall, much under par. Certainly need much more to be entertaining. Perhaps more laughter of secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. That's what separates bad movies from the good. "D"
