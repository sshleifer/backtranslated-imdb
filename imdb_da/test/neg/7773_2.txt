If you are a sucker for corny movies and look to see something you don't need to be aware of, it may be worth seeing. The story itself is very unrealistic. The dialogue is also not very credible. It is doubtful that you will find yourself associated with any of these signs because none of them are very sympathetic. the actor could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is noticeably out of place with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. While it doesn't say much, this is one of the best-performing performances I've seen from Tori spelling. She seems to be getting better with age. All in all, this extremely melodramatic film is mediocre at best.
