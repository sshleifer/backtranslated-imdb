If you are into bad movies for entertainment to witness bad movies, poor performance, poor production, etc. Come on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality .... you'll love Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will always be remembered as one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game ... as an actor, he will always be remembered as one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game ... I'm not sure who Rolf Bayer was ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 years old when he instructed this, maybe he might have been the next Spielberg in the hallway ... because if he was an adult man directing this ... a 15 or 16 year old could have done better .... The basis or plot of the movie probably had some historical merit and perhaps even truthfully accurate ... but the actual movie may be one of the worst movies made in American movie story ... I kept waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to come in somehow to save what "face" was left of this movie. I would have loved to have been on the red carpet, black tie gala to the Hollywood opening, as this movie preview ... since this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath ... it's on dime DVD racks now .... look for entertainment value ... this movie is so bad it is too good to pass ...
