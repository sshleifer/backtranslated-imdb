I've tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I just can't get past that all about it is just awful. I'm sure it was a brave move by someone to throw Jack Palance as the protagonist, but there is not a single fiber of my being who thinks he could act at all, much less act against type. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant writer, but it's not clear here. This odd and forced mish-mash in the 50's hipster dialogue seems to confuse any real meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even the good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane) seem to know How to Deliver Their Lines - It's as if they don't understand the meaning of what they say. And meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance are a great competition to see who can be more stent. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateurish and completely overwhelmed. The physical interaction between the characters is then set as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss the hideous set? It's so busy, ugly and constructed that it adds the robotic, interrupted quality of the characters, dialogue, and portrayals. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to suck the energy right out of me. It seems that everyone took an overdose of Valium every morning when they arrived on the set. It takes a rather miserable movie to get Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters to look bad, but it succeeds. <br /> <br /> I can see that it could have been effective as a game on or off Broadway, where intellectuals and beats could have congratulated themselves on appreciating the power of the plot and artistic blooms in the pseudo-hip dialogue.
