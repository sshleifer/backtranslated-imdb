My brain screamed, "Why do you look at it! Turn it off and go to bed!" But couch potatoness won out and I looked at the predictable ending. I think when it is Bruce Campbell, I need to give it a try. I find it hard to complain about a low budget film solely because of the low budget ... sometimes we see low budget Movies that show that a good story, good writing and good acting is enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from Sam that it takes a little more than filming it to make a movie. It is also sad because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70s and 80s, I just can't believe the movies are bad, are still made. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
