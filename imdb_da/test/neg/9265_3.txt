I bought this movie a couple of years ago and I was trying to find some information that even the mighty IMDb didn't have it on the list. It should have been all I needed to know. <br /> <br /> With friends like these is an anthology that plays as a collection of other award Twilight Zone / Ends episodes all linked by a bus journey that never really seems to end with the rest of the movie. Of the three stories, the only one I discovered was an entertainment value from the second episode where a man (black) grows out of the bacteria in a fire refrigerator. This episode wins points for a few spots of humor, and that is bizarre premise. In addition, there is an episode with a talked car (bland and pointless) and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​guessed the end of this). As has been mentioned in other comments, the 18-value is totally unjustified. There is nothing to offend here. If you're after a good horror rhetoric, check out the Asylum or Creepshow movies instead.
