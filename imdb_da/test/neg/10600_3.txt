This film had great production values, good lighting, costumes, sets, movies and plays. But somebody, somewhere, took the script and replaced all dialogue with class-school level, hardly literature writing. I felt my IQ drop points every time a character spoke. <br /> <br /> Have they done it on purpose? Was this just an accident with Brain Dead Studio Executives? At this point we do not know. <br /> <br /> All I know is this movie was a big mistake from the beginning to the end. We can't even see how Squad became the police, so instead of any character development we get what feels like a bad TV movie from the 60s. Or when. <br /> <br /> Find the manuscripts, beat them with a sock full of quarters. Everyone else, good work, but read your scripts next time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
