It is difficult to get into the depth of this kind of thing, as there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason to see it, let alone expressing an opinion about it. I don't know anything about this - laughed and stayed in the fake breasts. Apparently, it's an unofficial successor to 1982's "Slumber Party Massacre", which I DID enjoy as a fun slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a late-nite soft-core Cinemax porn! And not surprisingly, chickens such as Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (productive T & A actresses) are in this. Lots of nekkid hooters and not much else ... A group of 20-something high school cheerleaders, two random guys and the cool, stupid comic-relief slob are stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay overnight. The newly-escaped "Slumber Party" killer is in the area and starts killing them. There is no gore or originality, and I will not say that nudity is a genuine "selling point", as it is only so boring that a slasher film can be. Absolutely horrible ...
