This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set of masquerading as a castle, to be specific) replacing as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same, you want to watch from a Cinemax softcore porn, just like photography, sets, lighting and video were shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: There is no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic to your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the traumas in this movie are pretty trite. Want an example? A blind girl listening to a language tape teaching in the Italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see. <br /> <br /> This movie had a few things to do, though: The monster is actually pretty cool, pretty scary. And there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani, even a star of Italian "erotic" movies. However, Gore leaves much to be desired, as it does, even from experienced Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I've only seen two other Stuart Gordon movies: Re-Animator and From Beyond, both of which were excellent. But I will not let this little footnote in his career keep me from seeing many more of his film.
