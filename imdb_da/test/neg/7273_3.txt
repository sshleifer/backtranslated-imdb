I decided to watch this ultra-low budget film from the "Poverty Row" study, the PRC, because it co-starred the exciting character actor, Lionel Atwill ?? Plus I really liked the title. Although Atwill often played in these cheap films, his excellent shooting condition always made the movies much better, as his screen persona was great (his real life is also quite interesting, such as a bizarre soap opera). The reason I use the term "Poverty Row" is that this was a nickname given to the cheapest and worst production companies in the era. Many of these were not even real studies, but production companies renting space from the big studies at night! Yes, there is a good chance that this was filmed after normal working hours. A common thing for such studies. The story begins with Lionel Atwill tells his friends a story about something he was involved in years ago. A doctor falls in love with a lady, but he is afraid to tell her about herself. That's because his job is to kill people on Death Row ?? not exactly a glamor job! Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to break it to her, but regardless of whether she wants the man. Later you realize that this is because her own parents were criminals. Later, a man is killed and the lady implicated, although it is obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved (and is a bit of a nut) and evidence against the lady was poor. But apparently, the jury was filled with brainless people, and she was sentenced and sent to Death Row. Even more mindless is that her old girlfriend was the man responsible for her performance. Don't you think someone else could just cope with this case? Until this fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocence and proving that the flaky sister knows much more about the matter than she will admit. the film is only mildly interesting and a little silly. While it's easy to see, and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the movie never rises above the secular, and some of the actors are pretty shabby. It's sub-par and about what you would expect from such a low budget flick ?? and nothing more despite the cool title.
