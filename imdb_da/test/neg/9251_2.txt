This was shown on a premium channel so I didn't realize it was made for TV. Still, I like some of the movies on longevity (Lifestyle here in the UK), but it was terrible. The family was so cheesy, "Love you mother" "Love you even more treasure". When they were broken in for the second time, 10 minutes later, they were on it again, "Do you love mom" great cheesy smiles, etc. . She telephones her husband and tells him not to bother coming home. They were only broken up by a guy who wanted them dead, has a nutter who lives next door, who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not too long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> But as a comedy I would give it a good 7. I can even show it to my friends next time I have them around. Could be fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!
