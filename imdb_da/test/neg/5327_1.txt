I thought I had seen this movie before, as the plot overview was known. But when I looked at it one afternoon (in need of a bit of mindless-but-amusing entertainment), I didn't recognize anything - if I had seen it before, I must have blocked it in my memory. <Br /> <br /> This movie is horrible and it shows its age. In fact, it seems to be older than it is: more like a mid-80s moronic comedy. While I am a fan of toilet humor and can see the fun side of many things, this is "comedy" at its most puerile and homophobic. The plot is as thin as a supermodel that would not disturb me if only the movie was fun. <br /> <br /> There is only one entertaining line in the whole movie spoken by the Louis character: "Looks like someone threw away a perfectly good white boy!" In fact, Louis is the only sympathetic character (and that doesn't say much) . James and Carl are the kind of annoying, immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in Iraq; Susan Wilkins character is colorless (similar to Julia Roberts, but lacks her charisma) and there is zero chemistry between her and Carl - although it may be unfair to blame the actor as I do not know what she might have done with such a badly written part; and the villain is neither fun nor scary or memorable. <br /> <br /> There is good waste and bad waste. These are waste that should not be recycled.
