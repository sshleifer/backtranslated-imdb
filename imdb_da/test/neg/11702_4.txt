This is another movie I missed on Italian television as a child: remarkable for his quintet of aging stars, most of whom had never made a horror movie in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia Neal) , it's about the men's long-term crime coming back to haunt them. It has the form of a ghostless death sentence for the girl they all loved (Alice Krige), but they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their ego! Fairbanks, who was in charge of the deed, has twin sons (Craig Wasson) and then, also, Wars strengthens her revenge on them. Soon one of the latter, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman are all dead. Therefore, the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the crime scene, where they also have to fight with a couple of creepy tramps that somehow make the commandments of the war! I was delighted to see these veterans on their last leg (Douglas died before the film itself premiered as he had already completed another role while it turned out to be Astaire's own inauspicious swan song), but the GHOST STORY also went through many changes in mood - while maintaining a tight pace at all times and appearing everywhere in the bargain - to be anything but a failed curio. Having dollops of sex (including full frontal nudity from Wasson!) And cruel make-up effects muddled the waters more and marred the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's (another notable long-lasting) movie.
