If I were to choose the most depressing movie, try to be exciting, I have seen that would be this. I know how good the original is, it was better to be better than this. The movie is so dark and depressing, but it's not interesting to see either. I have seen depressing "thriller" -type films that were saved because of the tension to counteract and balance the dark quality. It did not fail. This was so disturbing to look at and it was nothing positive to make this a classic type of movie. I think another IMDb poster got it right by saying that this genre has just seen thrillers made in much better way. I totally agree - I would recommend skipping this - maybe I will see the original one day, but I doubt it. I give this a 2 out of 10.
