Against my own better judgment, I went to see this movie today and God I wish I didn't. Terrible. The first AVP movie looks like a classic compared to this, it's so bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a master historian. In fact, this is what I expect an Alien and / or Predator movie to look like if made by Uwe Boll! This movie actually offended me and the Lord only knows what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to see this piece of shit. I can't understand how any fan of any franchise liked this movie. I really don't know where to start. I mean, the first AVP was poop, but at least it's a semi-interesting story and setting, and sometimes some real tensions. It didn't take too seriously, and it could at least be half enjoyed on a clean "abandoned brain at home". But this one, it felt as if the people behind them thought they were doing the next horror masterpiece. One after another was a distinctly "exciting" scene in a dark room or corridor with crazy music playing that basically set you upside down and said "be scared now". As James Cameron once said, you can't be told to be scared, you can only get your own senses increased. The guys who made this movie were of course not aware because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared instead of letting you get to that level yourself. It's a clich√© for internet geeks saying "God, I was so sad this movie and felt like leaving", well that's exactly how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this movie very seriously, which removed every possibility of enjoyment. Even the guise of how governments do not lie to their people was played without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters are concerned, I knew that human characters should be totally meaningless to this movie, but seriously, if they are to be on the screen, they must at least do something relevant to history. I don't care that this guy gets knocked out by his boyfriend's boyfriend, I don't care about the mother whose "own daughter doesn't even know her, boo-hoo!" (a pair of night vision goggles? Give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother, which guy. Hell, even the mandatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more constructed than normal. I get the feeling that they expected the audience to be so shocked at the end, and to see that chestbursters come out of children, expectant mothers are raped and the like that it would make up for everything. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then we move into the movie stars and again very little to write home about. Were foreigners well designed? I wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the marvelous things. All you see is one of a mouth, a head, a tail or a really risky CG overview that climbs a wall and hardly enough to actually process that it is actually a stranger before Mr. "I cut Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos, think I'm doing the same here "Editor goes on with the disc tool. Also note how hack action directors always put their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. Predator could have fought huge sea bugs for everything we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time, and I thought some of the new weapon was cool, but it was about it. Also, since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a few things I liked. One was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (I also giggled a bit on "Come to the chopper!"), Though other references were stupid (the protagonist's name is Dallas, giving me a break). I also liked the visual FX for the Predator's vision, as well as how the hybrid alien looked (surely struck it from the Resurrection). But really, these are the only positive things. In general, I found this film inane, meaningless, insulting and above all offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. That they have closed the door open to someone else leaves me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had any decency, they would remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits in this movie. They have done nothing to deserve this.
