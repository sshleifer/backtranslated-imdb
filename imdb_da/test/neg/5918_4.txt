Peter Yate's Steve Tesich's pen is a relatively low key "thriller" that can't really get out of the ground. The story relates to the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the subsequent implication of a pathetic Vietnam veteran (James Woods) whom the police believe may have lifted his former employer. Like "Eyewitness", William Hurt never thinks his friend is capable of such action. Hurt is far below his usual strength and one finds it difficult to sympathize with him or an uninspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a little better in their support roles. Worth noting is the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery game. The ground is too confronted. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
