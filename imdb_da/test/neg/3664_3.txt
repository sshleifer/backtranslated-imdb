I must start by saying that the actors and actor did a good job for what they were working on. The problem in Dark Reality is that you had a bad director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative, he ended up pushing the movie up. From start to finish you can see that the film roll quality is low, but the bad lightning and shaking camera only damages it further by explaining what happens. The sound is subdued and often not understandable. I'm sure Huston (the director) would claim that this was causing a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than ample material to do so. To result in camera and lighting he did was a sign of the syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A basic sadistic female kidnapping story that avoids clich√© by keeping the girl in a desperate state all the time for good reason. Billy Bob from Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem with the story is that the dead people constantly harass the protagonist in her thoughts, and the second time they showed up I was fast-paced as this attempted to destroy the only decent part of the movie. <br /> <Ultimately, the way the director jabbed together and showed random blurred things and constantly scarce visible scenes (not because of horror, due to lighting, angles, and camera) eventually destroyed this movie. Of course, Huston was trying too hard and if anything, it looked like a poor film school project. If you want to see a decent story then it's okay, but be warned movie quality is enough for most to turn it off.
