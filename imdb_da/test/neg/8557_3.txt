Edge of Madness is a tale of a woman in the 19th century who is handpicked by dirty Scotsman who cannot hold her penis in her pants. He is just the case of having a younger brother who is against rape and killing him, but says continually that it was an accident. This makes her wife crazy, she gets mad and she takes the fall because she loves George too much. As I said, this kind of thing has been done before. This is just more "artistic" because it is Canadian and it is an indie production made on a low budget with hardly known actors (except that a child from Lassie, yes he is in it). I'm not thinking if it should go to Oscar bait, but it was definitely boring. And this is based on a 40-page short story. Half of the short story is incorporated into this flick, and I'm happy. Otherwise I would die to death. Unfortunately, I had to see it in my Media Fundamentals class, and I had a job on it. Read the short story and compare and contrast the girl to the story. BORING. <br /> <br /> You know it's harder to answer movie questions when you don't like the movie. Oh yes, I hope this is the last type of job I and my class get. For what it is worth, Annie Herron was quite warm, she had a nice, soft ass and I liked the naked parts of her in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for boring, Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality ..plus nudity.
