Now I have to admit when I saw the trailer for this movie, I looked forward to it. I'm generally a fan of light heart romantic comedies and from the trailer, it's the impression I got from this movie. But I spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were a few entertaining scenes, the view of the film was generally depressing. I also found it hard to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time that the director could have used to explore the characters occupied by an unnecessary overuse of Opera, making the movie to pull out and slowly. <br /> <br /> All in all, though there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite misleading and I would only suggest that you look at this if there really is nothing else that tickles your fancy. <br /> <br /> Not amazing and as I have said before; Mix.
