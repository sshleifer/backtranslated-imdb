After watching the movie, I feel the father, and the mother are both reasonable people, even though they are not perfect at all. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's journal a precise portrait of himself? No. Most people write only problems in their diary because she wants to solve the problem. So a journal is always a more negative side of a person. In this film, the author judges her mother's life by her journal. Not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is so ugly, external, and internal. First, she said that her father's second marriage is "not fair" for her mother. Then she said she didn't love her mother. So she doesn't love both father and mother. I doubt she loves anyone in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Through the film, I feel the author and his sisters are lacking in love and respect for their parents. However, I feel the father that mother loves their children, even the author tries to portray them as a cold, deceitful person.
