I rented this movie out of the local video store one day you know that kind of movie with the boxing type just getting out and telling you to "rent me". Well, if you see this boring movie in your video business, move on. Fight craving, rent a porn because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film lapses in repeated murders, and a hard-boiled politician stumbles around and deals with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc.). Would you like to see if the fast forward function of your VCR works? Rent this movie and put your worries to the test.
