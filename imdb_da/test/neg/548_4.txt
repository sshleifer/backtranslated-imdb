Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's last films - he ruled only a few after that. He had made the "Maisie" films in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credit it says "From the short story of Elizabeth", and completely left the author's surname ... quite strange, but since it was von Armin, they might not have wanted the German association at that time ... Sad to hear it was a flop when it was released, with the funny names like Frank Morgan (the wizard) and Jessie Ralph who played the toilet Fields' failing mother-in-law in "Bank Dick". Two gals in London (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things do not go as planned. Reginald Owen plays the man with several personalities. Except for a few fun moments, it moves quite slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot here as the indulgent take-charge type, and the picture is pretty fuzzy and out of focus too much of the movie. Italy's views are all obvious backgrounds. The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a bigger role. This was remade in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
