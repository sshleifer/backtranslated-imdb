Making a movie based on a true story, especially as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 anniversary crash, is difficult for even the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try! The actual names of both the survivors and the accidents affected by the Uruguayan air force crash have been ALL changed, the crash itself is naturally staged in a very durable way, and the aspect of cannibalism has been unnecessary and gorily played. Offensive it made lots of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, it believed it was mercifully forgotten. But the same people behind this would later give us the equally disgusting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED! <br /> <br /> This cheap horror exploitation flick made it necessary to make ALIVE some fifteen years later. That movie was a masterpiece. Survive, to put it mildly, it is not.
