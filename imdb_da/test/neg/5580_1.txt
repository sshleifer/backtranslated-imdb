Sometimes it is good to see a really bad movie like this, just so you know how decent an actor Keanu Reeves is by comparison. The prerequisite for this story is good: teens go on a boat, meteor lands in water, aliens kill teenagers. What is there not to love about it if you are in screaming thrillers? But I should have known that something was up when I read it, it was only 75 minutes long. I thought, "I hate judging movies with how long they are. Who says a movie should be 90 minutes?" But when I took the DVD home from BBuster, I was shocked at the terrible production quality that was about this totally amateurish piece of waste. The only reason I saw it to the end was because I didn't have cable TV and I've already paid four bucks for it. But there was a ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is actually decent and far outclasses this boy. First of all, the special effects were cheap and convincing. So foreigners - costume seemed to be interesting (rubber boots), but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you won't see them! And almost none of the players were convincing enough to suspend disbelief. Finally, I have to say that the DVD jack was made with much higher production standards than the movie itself, which felt like a rip-off, so beware when renting other DVDs. Save your $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
