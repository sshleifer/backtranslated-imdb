This movie was nothing more than utilizing gay cheesecake. It was not an "art" film; Just an excuse to show more free, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male gender nudity. There was a wardrobe scene involving over a dozen naked men. The camera zooms in on men's donkeys and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their full-screen dicks. There are several scenes in this movie that show the penis after the penis. It becomes superfluous REAL quickly and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I wondered if I accidentally saw a Playgirl video. If the same scenes were filmed using women (eg: completely naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly), it would quickly be dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye like that ... which is all this movie is. Any artistic profit was washed down in the bay by the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing requirements, etc. were simple and superficial; No more developed than what one would expect from a first-year philosophy student. Just cut to the hunt and rent a gay porn instead.
