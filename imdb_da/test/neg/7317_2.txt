This is a typical college comedy and its very average. The story is OK, but not very entertaining. Its about an unfortunate guy named Reno, who loses his job, gets his car ripped off and dies uncle in a strip bar. Hans got a girlfriend though (a nice one btw .-). Yet this uncle gives him his mansion in LA and Mercedes as heritage, and soon Reno and his girlfriend move to LA for this new house. The problem is that they will need some roommates to pay the high rent for this house and then the film unfolds ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts OK and has a few funny jokes here and there, but Suddenly the movie takes a trip straight down to hell ... The end is bad. Really bad. It destroys everything about the movie. You know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
