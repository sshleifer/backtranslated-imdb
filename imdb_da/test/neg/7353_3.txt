Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a bad schnook, which was eventually undermined by femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum allows himself to be thrown as another loser who falls to the femme fatale Faith Domergue in the 1950's "Where Danger Live". Perhaps they both felt that it was a good way to show that they had 'reach' as ​​actors ?? Playing against the type, the usual 'hard guy' role they were known for, would enhance their image as actors who could play any role. But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic love-sick milquetoast in 'Criss Cross', did nothing to improve Lancaster's career. Not only is Lancaster completely miscast in Thompson's one-tone role, but there is something that by nature does not like (and I can say pathetically) about the film's protagonist. Initially, Criss Cross is an interminably slow moving movie. Amongst the many unnecessary scenes in the movie is in the beginning: the flashback that chronicles Thompson's confrontation with Dan Duryeas Dundee at the nightclub. Everything that happens in the first feedback is explained later in the picture: The illegal affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's strained relationship with Martinez, policeman and his bad blood with Dundee. If Director Siodmark felt compelled to start the movie with a flashback, why not keep it for three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. In 'Criss Cross' it takes a while before the protagonist commits himself and exits the "ordinary" world of Act One. It is the scene where he "passes by" and "runs into" Anna at the nightclub. And notice how Siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between Anna dances and Steve staring at her? In addition to the horizontal, he also spent a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and his Rhumba Band than moving the story together. <br /> <br /> Until the war in Act Two, the story tells Thompson to have various unpleasant encounters with Anna and then discusses her sorrows at his usual watering hole. In the middle of Act Two, he learns that Anna has gone and married Dundee. It becomes clearer at this time that one of the film's key weaknesses is that Dundee is never on the screen during most of the second action. There are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee during this time and we are back with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovebirds. As it turns out (and Anna explains this later to Steve) the reason why she left was no just because he disappeared for eight months, but she also felt pressure from Steve's mother and direct threats from Martinez, the policeman, which meant he would make sure she ended up in the women's house for detention. Anna goes back to Steve because she realizes she's made a big mistake with Dundee? It turns out he has beaten her and she is now afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the stupid layoffs released by more than one character in Criss Cross is that you can never hijack an armored car. But everyone seems so surprised when Steve points it out, it can be done if it's an 'inside job'! You would have thought that Dundee would have known about Steve's 'profession' as a hooded car driver and told him in advance. But of course, Steve must make the proposal so Dundee won't kill him after discovering his affair with Anna (if they are so scared to get caught, why does Steve and Anna meet in his apartment where Dundee can easily find them?) . I really got a kick out of Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the 'brain' of the operation. Dundee is so stupid that he has to hire this alcoholic ex-professor type who plots heist on a card. Oh, it's about buying the ingredients to construct the gas bombs used during the robbery, and of course Finchley is good too! <br /> <br /> The only really good scene in the whole movie is armored car robbery. The editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a hoist that had gone bad. As the gas bombs go out, the brutality of the gang appears to a great extent when Dundee kills the innocent armored car guard. <br /> <br /> The movie climax is like the rest of the movie. Why does it take so long for one of Dundee's goons to kidnap Thompson? There is the nurse, so goon waits outside, then he comes in and pretends that he is a friend, Steve falls asleep, and finally when he wakes up, he knocks him off. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna at the house, we wonder how Anna got her hands on cash. Did she somehow steal it from Dundee after the hoist when he went to dinner? It has never been explained. Even worse, Anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatal out of the blue. First, her selfishness and attraction to Dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection in the hands of Steve and Martinez's threats. But after returning to Steve because she fears Dundee, she inexplicably beats him when he is most vulnerable. Just like there is instant coffee, you have instant femme fatale. <br /> <br /> In the "Film Noir" An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style "by Silver and Ward, the authors welcome 'Criss City Cross as" one of the most tragic and convincing of film noir ". To have a tragedy, you need characters that have great depth, and to be convincing, you must have a story that is plausible, nor does Criss Cross, it's an overrated "B Movie" who somehow found themselves in the pantheon of art noirs, once again the crew member triumphed on evaluating the pictures from yesteryear.
