It was perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Clearly, no research was done on Detroit (forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha !!). The scripture was horrible, the assumption was absolutely incredible, and frankly the signs were embarrassing. I can't understand for life why experienced actors would bow so low and engage in something this god horrible. Now I have never seen the original and do not know if this film pays homage to the original form. It is my understanding that the original was not in Detroit. Why they would deviate from it without examining details of the setting, only tells me that it was more than the caste that sought to pay the rent. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this junk unless you're from Detroit and want some comic relief.
