I made the mistake of seeing "Dark Star" (1974) late one night many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad plays. <br /> <br /> 2. Poor writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically silly plot. (Destroying a whole planet because its orbits are unstable or in the way will only make matters worse: instead of having a large, easily avoidable object, you will have thousands of smaller but equally lethal and more difficult objects to trace.) /> <br /> 4. Absolutely unrealistic signs. A painted beach ball like a room stranger? The authors must have made too many substances. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, most actors staring in "Dark Star" never did anything else. Of those who did something else, the majority never reacted after Dark Star. Therefore, having the Dark Star on one's play was a death star for his acting career!
