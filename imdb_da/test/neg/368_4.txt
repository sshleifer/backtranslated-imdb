Some spoilers **** A soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica come close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted movie. I'm not aware if the curious stop and start structure of the movie comes from being digested initially in serialized form (the announcer describes the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she should appear as a sexworker (whatever), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly / girly, totally hopeless when it comes to dressing and unable to make any interpersonal attachments in the world. In addition, she is always shown with two-day growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as well as emphasizing how foggy her life is. And she's waiting to get sex distribution surgery when she doesn't seem to have done anything else to pass on her transition. In fact, the character looks like a dragon queen, not someone in the middle of the transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of people from outside who are not really connected to transgender people. The film's fetishment of GRS surgery is a way to objective people who go through the transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the movie at least. At least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender ... I thought the male actor who propagated Veronica was okay, but not better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex sign of energy, self-indulgence, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by a person with female energy, a Charlotte could go on a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was referred to Veronica, but more like an abstract idea of ​​a person with male / female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good blow), not as a unique person. Yes, what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean that an already stereotyped minority needs to be stereotyped more in the process. <br /> <br /> This movie also shows that the Danes are miserable dancers. For such a promising premise (better done in a movie like "Different For Girls") is the final movie a letdown.
