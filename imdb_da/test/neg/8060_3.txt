The first thing I note is the music. It's no wonder as Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust's haunting theme or masterpiece from a story of two sisters, but I don't stop so early in the movie. One must assume that woman examines her hypothesis for her PhD thesis that cannibalism as an organized practice has never existed, would you think they should take into account that they are wrong and prepare for the journey accordingly? Or why go at all if you already think that the hypothesis is true before being tested? It is pretty incredibly ignorant and makes the movie seem so much more unrealistic and poorly scripted. It is actually the same as Ruggero Deodato's film, just totally poorly prepared. No weapons, no decent walking, just nonsense through and through. <br /> <br /> People don't go on trips like this to college without months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I excavators ... Things don't go for a really good start for our brave but stupid adventurers as they fade to miss a jaywalking iguana, and their decoy pet ferret falls out of the truck almost until it's dead, so to fall into a mud hole, well I guess it's time to go. <br /> <br /> Okay, then they flip a coin to see if they continue or forget it all. How does this scene even matter? Their whole conviction rests on a coin? After they have spent time and money, and preparation just comes out there. This just gets worse. Defiinitely are some of the worst plays and writings and music that has ever been to the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike tells how he and his friend were caught by the cannibals and caged in mud with 3 inch long leeches sucking on their blood. I found it interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into the jungle, a man they fail like a simple native, sit on the ground and eat such leeches ... wonder if they are the same? Really though this movie is just awful because the script is terrible and the play is emotionally contemplating the content. They just agree to extinguish themselves and then be eaten by cannibals as it is not a big decision. Of course, Mike is insane, but like in the first movie, the natives treat such awful behavior that is simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's films easily feel that the Americans got what they deserved, while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what is again the Americans. <br /> <br /> And because of that, the movie feels somewhat pointless. We've already got the point from the first movie, so why was the sequel made? The lieutenant's name is Rizzo?! Can it get worse? Often with movies like these when you look up, you find they haven't really acted in many other movies, and their bios are anything but non-existent so you can imagine I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in This movie was in Scorsese's Gangs of New York. Now, Lt. Rizzo well-known and I found that he was in the 2002 film Spiderman as a very small role as a tow boat captain. Reminds me how William Shatner went from being an admiral on the USS Enterprise to a cop in a car. Irony, sometimes irony seems. Shatner could never get the right music before his latest album "Has Been", which is great, just as Bono of U2 could never get a haircut, and Dan Marino could never win any Superbowls. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the irony is just sad, like Christopher Reeve, Superman can't go irony. The man will always be a legend, but because he was such a great guy, I hand over again. <br /> <br /> At this point you can tell that I'm pretty sorry to discuss Cannibal Ferox himself. <Br /> <br /> The Cannibal Holocaust message was about who is the real delusion and what is really evil? What would make natural life unknown to our moral records, or what we do to others with malicious intent? Cannibal Ferox's message seems to be 'Beware of what you're looking for, because you can just find it.' I will say this to Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her dissertation and claims that cannibalism does not exist, she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear training, but generally this movie was really bad. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
