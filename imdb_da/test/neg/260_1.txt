K Murli Mohan Rao made the much better BANDHAN in 1998 This movie is a horrible remake of THE BRING SINGER <br /> In short, the movie consists of: Salman Khan, who these days used to have the role of a spoiled lover who loses her girlfriend and he also had his comic books where he hung bad, even today he does well, he does it all here and also loses his shirt in scenes. Jackie Shroff - wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid. He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra, so in one scene is he shown as a female player? <br /> <br /> Recognizes Kumar's confusing characterization <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherje drilling, overweight and not worthy of special Pooja Bhatra, fair and actress, but lacking talent <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah - says a slice like a poetry <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - Poor guy the 2 kids were also horrible. The story is the same and has horrible cartoons, a sudden love story and boring drunk scenes plus a forced cartoon of Shakti Kapoo r <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The music is decent <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is just going through the movements, Jackie is bad, Rani is as usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are not good Inside is horrible
