Awful in a bad / good way ... this movie has officially become the worst "made for TV movie" in my book ... except for the camp value it gives, I give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. Suggestions: Watch with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you will throw some on the screen! Preferably, friends who like Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City Days' ... this movie is terribly fun. This is definitely the lowest point of career from all cast members ... honestly, I don't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is completely pathetic. EVERYONE participated in the school for overworking and poor Joan Van Ark I think she was the only one who took this absurd theater seriously ... however, she is credited as a producer. Her "mother" jeans and poor plastic surgery are stage stalls. This film also crosses the oh so delicate line of social iniquity when they introduce a mentally challenged character to the plot. This is a fuzzy movie that appears on Lifetime, which is listed as {With malicious intent} .... has anyone else had the pleasure?
