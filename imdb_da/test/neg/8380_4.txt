First, some colleges make the students take courses from their parents' loved ones. Second, few women sleep professors with sofa beds. Third, few brassy coeds have a father who boils in their dorm room. Fourth, when another member of a college group group project group encounters a violent transition, the college PRESIDENT will lift the entire class and NOT blind eye as the professor pleasantly controls the rest of the group against pigs deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the secular content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!
