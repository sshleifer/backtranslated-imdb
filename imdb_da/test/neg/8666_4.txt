Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this seemingly more faithful movie. The 1999 film is spoiled by many austen-purists, but I admire the job that Rozema did to make Mansfield Park his own. It can't be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well-written, beautifully shot and well-acted by a superior cast. I can't see how Austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and reissued at Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The play is lumpy and stupid to start, the production values ​​are sharp and cast (except for Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) is largely guilty of bad acting. I can't think of a worst-case scenario than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Her appearance was all wrong (bleached hair and dark breasts ??) and her talent was simply not suitable for the material. Sir Thomas looked constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot, like the actors who portrayed Crawfords (when I think about how superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I blame my head). <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the 1983 version, so I can't comment on it, but I'd advise anyone curious about giving the '99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and make your own mind.
