This movie is very disappointing for the one who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a pure carved tale of piracy in the Caribbean and it would have made a grand exercise. It would also have been very easy to make. All actions take place aboard a ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screenwriters took the title from Sabatini and threw away the rest of the book. Even the protagonist's name was changed, and his screen perspective was completely different from the person described in the novel. It is a sad loss for someone who loves good sea history.
