River Queen tries to pack a complicated, sweeping, historical story in just under two hours. There are some breathtaking combat scenes, and the Wanganui scene is beautifully captured. The movie, however, suffers from some bad leads - Samantha Morton (Sarah) came over as unconvincing. There was apparently an indecision about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif thrown by fate or as a strong, definite character with a clear picture of her destiny. Kiefer Sutherland's character - Private Doyle - seemed meaningless and mostly - incomprehensible. Keifer's Irish brogue needs some polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (as Sarah's son "Boy") were well rounded and credible. The last 20 minutes of the River Queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed. It was as if they decided they had to tie all the loose ends before 120 minutes was up. Eg. Where on earth did Wiremu know how to find Sara and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with an open mind. I hadn't read or heard anything much except for his restless production. What I experienced was a mish mash in New Zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.
