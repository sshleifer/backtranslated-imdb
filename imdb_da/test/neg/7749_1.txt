The director of this celluloid waste is specialized in horrible exploitation films, where pretension is everything; The previous year, he "Dangerously Close", whose good idea (about the gang of power in school and the school document editor against them) was immersed in a sea of ​​dullness and he would continue to do "Cyborg," Jean Claude Van Damme's worst. movie ever (no medium fever). This would be a comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her movie debut - who is a total blemish whose inner child is only awakened after she falls to the center of the earth and has a set of badly filmed, impossible to follow adventures (mainly involving one Set dwarfs who want her because she has big bones - go figure!) before returning home for the better is not fun, gripping or entertaining at least. And someone who sees it here to salvage over Miss Ireland is also being dismissed - not because of her voice, but because she spends most of the movie buried under lots of baggy clothes with big glasses to start. No wonder Cannon, the manufacturers, is out of service. Amazingly, Kathy Ireland has made better movies since then ... or maybe it's not that great. Next to this is "Barb Wire" "Aliens."
