That should actually own up to make such a horrible movie! In fact, I am more embarrassed that I sat through it all. It looks like an old 80-year-old sci-fi movie complete with super-fake watching "special effects", queer pictures and very cheesy dialogue. Maybe it's the way they wanted it to be, maybe they think it's cool to make movies in the 80's way it comes back in style. Who knows ... If you think the promised eye-candy will save the movie, you're out for a disappointment - the so-called "babes" are manic and even ugly. They can't act at all, I don't understand why they couldn't at least get great chickens if they want babies without talent! But I think when you make a movie, so stupid, you don't get very good choices, hot chicks don't just go up to make this kind of pitiful crap!
