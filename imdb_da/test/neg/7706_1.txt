So many of these types of movies are out these days. This zombie flick falls into the big "cheese" category as opposed to the much more polished dawn of the dead and the day of the dead. In all fairness, the two films were major study releases with large budgets behind them. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie can still be good if they would only stop accepting and using the worst scripts around. The one who wrote this movie must have been full all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie had such special effects and a very uniform plot line. The one big difference from other movies of its kind is the time it takes for people to turn into zombies. In this one it seems to take a few seconds for them to die and then become a zombie. But with ease, this "infection" spreads, you can get zombie blood over you and don't even seem to be in danger of infection, and believe me that the people in this are covered in blood. <br /> <br /> The main problem I had is that our 2 main stars sometimes walked around dozens of zombies and didn't get bitten. When everyone else becomes astonishingly fast, these 2 were swamped by zombies as they were unarmed and could get out of it without any problems. Our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. I was laughing at that time. Unarmed, like 10 zombies on her and a missile hit the building, but she manages to get out without a scratch? Okay for sure .... Also, the one who advised these people on how special forces behave has never spent any time in the military. They should have seen a movie like Blackhawk down first to get at least one idea of ​​how they behave in combat situations. A soldier was a fat overweight SPECIAL FORCES private. LOL it was a good one. Another stopped zombies thinking they were surviving, even putting their weapons down at some point. These guys are in there to fight zombies and they acted as soldiers from the movie Stripes. Special forces, lol ... Then they come to the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and it all becomes very confusing. The explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie. There was no point at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the Anti Bush jokes. The military lady in the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and ultimately it was the vice president of a "non-revealed place" who gave the order. It was the best part of the movie for me.
