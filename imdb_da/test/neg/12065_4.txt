It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, being honest with him, often missing out on other micro-budget directors. Check out the minimal crew members at Camp Blood, none of the usual thanking everyone for the pizza joint they ate in, its Brad and his friends and thats it, not pretentious nonsense. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not your average horror flick heroine, but does it well enough for you to hardly notice Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so much fun, it hurts. The clown is hardly a sincere horror file, bad guy, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life, and the picture shatters well with rural areas. Camp Blood is horror as a blue collar and basically as it gets, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a thing.
