The movie was pretty bad. It's not so much a script problem. It's just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing. The movie seems to plow along with a slow, disturbing rate. The story of San Franpsycho is that there is a serial killer on the loose who kills morally corrupt individuals (perhaps I read too much into it, but hey, that is my nature apparently) after San Franpsycho kills a few people under the golden gate Bridge we are introduced to one of the protagonists of the movie: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as curmudgeony cop named Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to chase the killer (he has a serious name, he's just The Killer), and he's trying to force a local news reporter called Rita to help him with his investigation, Bill is the stereotypical hard-edged policeman and threatens Rita to throw her in jail for preventing justice. Still, a couple of scenes pass by and suddenly Rita finds a letter back from the psychopath (he is a cold-blooded psychopath!) And she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and helps them with the study. <Br /> <br /> The movie is trying to be a tight murder thriller, but it's just a kind of bug. It's much like the movie The Black Dahlia it is trying to be excited, but it's just incredible compared to that. The movie tries to be serious throughout, but it has scenes like where The Killer masturbates (of course a fan of gore porn, what about lines like: "Ooh blood on her" or something like that), and Joe Estevez hits the table: " He's a cold-blooded killer! "I admit to throwing more than once in the movie, even though I'm sure it was supposed to be a deadly serious movie. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive points the movie is making for it is the fact that I didn't pay money to see it (huzzah netflix). And it's sad because I could see some good in their movie after watching The Damned. Sure the movie had its fair share of errors, but it was fun. Unfortunately, San Franpsycho has nothing to do with it. It went well, it has an okay script, it's not too big, but it could have been interesting. Instead, what you get is a murderer who does not span or even have vagueness of comfortable death. Also, the other reviews claim that the movie has "a good twist ending that is shocking" apparently I saw another movie because at about an hour I kind of figured out what would happen. The end didn't shock me at least. I would continue to insult this wreck of a movie, but I don't think I want to. Long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller (I use this term loosely) that does not have "Hitchcockian thrills", as another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, bland deaths that work with all the feelings of a wood shovel , and a decent soundtrack. I am sure others will try to defend this with the usual: It was a low budget film, they did the best they could with such a low budget and all the other nonsense. But when you get down to it, there was very little that they really could have used the budget, there was very little special effects work, the soundtrack sounds like it might have been reused from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned, And that's the same damned crew from the two movies. This movie reminds me a lot about another low budget flick that wasn't good and it was called Mr. Jingles, the two are about the same quality, they fail to deliver anything close to pleasure and should disappear quickly in turmoil.
