What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET, as I have said about many other boring soft core porn movies? Very small . It's just another movie with a very weak plot used to create very convincing scenes between male non-actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos, who of course have silicon implants. In fact, the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you normally see in this type of movie, as the cast members strike their hips together and give painful expressions as they have constipation or something. No wonder many people claim that sex is over character, they have probably seen too many of these movies on Sennat cable stations
