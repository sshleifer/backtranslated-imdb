I basically saw the only reason why it should have references in the third wealth of it. It turned out to be a rather brainless and predictable slasher film that seemed to be made to appeal to feminists or something. Let me tell you something if you are expecting a whole movie to see the attractive woman's tits, The last thing you want is a "tasteful" finished sex scene with annoying camera angles that don't show anything. Her busty friend didn't even get her out, but we saw lots of men's ass and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off. And in the end, you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel tips and oscillations in the villain (who turns out to be the hunk, funny enough) and she easily knocks him out (uh huh) while her male love is bound and waiting to be rescued. The funniest part was when she picks up a chair and "swings" it on the guy, and it breaks over him. Now it would be as much as she could manage to lift the chair so as not to smash it against a person with enough power to break it! It looks ridiculous, she basically relies on him, and it falls apart. If you have to do this kind of "roll reversal" waste (which has already been done to death) then you should at least make it half likely. <br /> <br /> However, there was a good deal. The bad guy got the better of his seedy friend, taught her a lesson to be such a tramp and sleeper. It is not exactly what the feminists want. <br /> <br /> Really stupid. Not that American slasher flicks are generally much better, but you should wonder why they were bothering. It brought nothing new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
