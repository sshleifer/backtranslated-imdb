If you've ever listened to any of the James Lee Burke books on tape or CD, and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree with me that Will is the personification of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or I've heard), and no one portrays a Texan better IMHO, but he's not a Cajun. His delivery is wrong. I have lived in the state for several years and I can still hear the strange patois that contains a Louisiana accent. TLJ has nothing like that. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be thrown into this role? Rock? Mickey Rourke? he will have to be big). All in all, I thought the movie was just a 4 - plot flew around like a fish out of water and did not have the normal interesting but nonlinear continuity that the book typically has. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Hollywood will try another JLB book, "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We wanted to see some of the best villains from JLB ever.
