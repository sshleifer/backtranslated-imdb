(This review will have some very obvious spoilers, so beware.) <br /> <br /> A friend brought this over and we made it through 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that Fast Forward 8x Speed ​​was the only way to watch this movie. There were points when we watched the movie at normal speed, where I would leave, prepare some of the lunch and return to find out that nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened to the background, no important facial movements were made, nothing but mind-numbing awkward silence. <br /> <br /> This is NOT how to make a thought-provoking movie, especially when the movie's plot follows the same basic Hollywood movie troops. If I told you that Disney made a movie about 4 girls who started a band and the singer was a French exchange student, what would you expect to be "the conflicts" that arise? have to overcome stage war? Someone has an unspoken infatuation? The band is late for their performance, and a page character has to buy them time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All these things happen in this movie. <Br /> <br /> At no time in this movie do you even have the slightest fraction of concern that these girls will not be able to reach their goals. <br /> <br /> * THIS IS THE SPOILERS SECTION * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I've spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know all the tapes that are referred to in mail collections and MDs that they go through and I've been singing along with the title track with karaoke friends. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie from Japan I've ever seen. Don't be confused. Although the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical Japanese high school stuff, this is not a "typical day of life for" movies. This is "a day in the life of 4 extremely random, highly conflicting, inappropriate Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also noticeable problems with the DVD. Viz decided that a big extra would be a producer who read the Wikipedia high record about the blue hearts. What a value! In addition, they care so little about the subtitle that the band's name in the subtitles, "Paran Maum", is different than it is in the chapter selection menu "Paran Marum". In the final auditorium scene there is a very visible reflection / ghost effect on everything, but it seems to be the fault of the original film. <br /> <br /> Don't see if you don't absolutely love awkward silences.
