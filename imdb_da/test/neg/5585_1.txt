6 out of the 8 comments on this topic considered this movie to be worth seeing, so let me correct the balance. <br /> <br /> If this is the best thing British independent filmmakers have to offer, they have to unpack their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry. Unfortunately for me, who was 82 minutes, I will never see again and hopefully I will save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of yourself. <br /> <br /> While the idea behind the movie is interesting, it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached. Students are boring and uninteresting, and frankly you will not worry about what happens to them. The soldiers are practically caricatures of any villain ever seen in movies. I waited for Captain Markovic to turn an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination, but these were ruined by the shockingly bad plays, bad script writing and blurry camera work. The budget may have been better used to send the "actors" (and I use this term loosely) to actor classes or Thomas Brothers to make movies, or perhaps to a spell check, because the subtitles were misspelled. That missing spellings were not picked up and corrected, tells volumes about the entire production during the course. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments are concerned with the filmmakers, whether or not they saw a completely different movie. I ask Thomas Brothers to never give up their daily jobs, because if they continue in this field, they will surely starve to death.
