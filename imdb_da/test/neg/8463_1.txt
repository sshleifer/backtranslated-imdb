Five fingers are so bad that I hardly know where to start. So let me first admit that I've only seen the first half hour. When the first finger was cut off, I thought to sleep a more useful activity. I told my boyfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. Couldn't the producer, director and / or screenwriter hear a chess mate? Like me? They should have used a digital chess clock and not an analog. This great goof makes the mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh. How, when and why did Martijn designate a Moroccan girlfriend? Such an affair is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Calling me a retard is, of course, an insult to all the people suffering with a much lower than average IQ. Moreover, as far as I know, retarder does not go with chess. I do. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest problem is the script. Just compare the little intelligent movie Hard Candy. In order to keep the spectator in a grip, the information must be revealed little by little. A good twist occasionally helps. I understood from other reviews that there is a big end of the movie. Any smart person can guess what it is. Of course, this raises several questions - why was the travel guide killed? Oh my, why should I break myself? The whole movie focuses on only one thing: the chopped fingers. The actors haven't even learned Hitchcock's lesson: getting a bomb exploded is exciting. It is more exciting to show that the bomb is ticking. But no, we do not see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown is over. I will not waste any more words on this crap. Go see Hard Candy.
