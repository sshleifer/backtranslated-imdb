This movie is a desperate attempt to run the skirts of the success of the Star Wars movies. The movie uses recycled footage from "Battle Beyond the Sars", which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least this one is better than "Battle Beyond the Stars" - there is no real play in this movie (but it's a Roger Corman movie - what did you expect again the whole soundtrack was made on a keyboard / synthesizer, the sound effects reused from "battlestar galactica" - there are no special effects because they were reused / rearranged space scenes from another movie, costume looks like something right of 1981 Salvation Army salvage. - The little boy in this movie gives a helluva performance and he would revive again to be in Sylvester Stallone's movie "Over the Top" - I give this movie 3 stars out of 10
