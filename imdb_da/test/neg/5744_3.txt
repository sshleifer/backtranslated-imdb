This is about some vampires (who can run around in the sunlight) that cause some problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent with his command to investigate. The film opens with Van Dien & Co., who goes through the jungle, and there is this big black guy who just can't positively act. He speaks all his lines as if he were reading them from the cue cards for the first time. His voice is also so low that it is positively fun. Great way to get the movie started! In any case, they run into some of our vampires, shoot them (it causes them to die for about 20 seconds), and of course they come back to life. Van Dien notes that one of them was impaled over a wooden leg and shouts to his friends to kill them with wood. The stunt work must be seen as the belief - the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees, which must make them look like they can climb really lightly, but it makes them look like they are jumping around on bungee cords or something. Yes ... at least later, the big black guy is down in South America with some guys (Van Dien not included) and they are being attacked by several vampires. It's really bad that these guys never heard of a wristwatch, because it seems to be the perfect weapon to kill the little blood sugar, but instead use the big old sticks they try to rob the vampires at hand . The big black guy ends up getting caught, and he eventually becomes a great strong vampire leader. Van Dien is fighting him later. It does not help that everyone through the movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so, which would allow a person to keep an effort in them quite easily. They just try to keep bets in them in the middle of hand-to-hand combat. Yes, not exactly brilliant tactics. <br /> <br /> There is a hot child (remember Veronica from The Lost World TV show? Yes it's her!) who also happens to be walking in the middle of Vampire County on some kind of research mission, and she also happens straight as Van Diens former wife. Hey, what are the odds? It's a pity she's not in the movie much more than she is. Will her and Casper come together again eventually? Will Van Dien defeat the big black guy who can't act? Will the circus performer vampire make you laugh through all the many action scenes? Do we want to hear the music of the three stooges when someone does something fun? Did even Lynda Carter forget how to shop in her little cameo (she is more convincing in her Sleep Number Bed advertising)? These questions and more will be answered if you do it right up to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know it can score some points on it so bad, it's good scale, but it's about it. Eh, it's a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle, I think it's a bit entertaining.
