Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I'm getting involved. The works. I want to get involved. I spend time watching things. I saw emmys last night on TV. How in the endless world did the Empire Falls (excellent name) TV movie up to any prizes? It had really wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can anyone pretend it was an OK (TV for goodness) manuscript? OK direction? You know I want all the best. Really. But I thought it was very hard that Hollywood placed this very bad movie for so many honors. Pricing? For me, it was kind of a wake-up call that Hollywood is such a small ecological community. Being cynical is not really my thing. But wow. --xptyngi
