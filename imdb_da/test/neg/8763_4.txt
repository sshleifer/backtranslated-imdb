One of the low budget horror schlockmeister actor, John Carradine's more animated roles as an implied Nazi scientist, makes people into zombies to serve the kingdom. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the simplest orders .... resembles McDonald's staff. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name when America was not at war at the time they were filmed, but it is quite obvious who the evil guys are working for! <br /> <br /> There seem to be two types of zombies in movies, the traditional voodoo type, popular in the old black and white movies from the 1930s and '40s. Blank eyed and just follows commands from another as they stumble together. And then there is the type we know from later movies like 'The Living Dead' and 'The Evil Dead'. Still roaming, but with only the intention of killing and eating meat and brains for their victims. Both have their moments in different films over the years. <br /> <br /> 'Revenge' has the former zombie type, although these are particularly knitted looks and would look more at home in an ancient time, showing freak nodding as they bite the heads of chickens. A black zombie called Lazarus with her wild hair, resembles a young Don King. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie with the others, and this is where he makes his mistake. Although he lets her keep her strappy heels like a lovely female touch as he turns her into one of the living dead, she is not happy about it. It all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears and the morality of history must never be your king to a zombie, it's just asking for trouble .... The movie is interesting enough and it rolls quickly to a finish but never rises over It is the origin of poverty. Not a patch on any real zombie classics, but fun just the same.
