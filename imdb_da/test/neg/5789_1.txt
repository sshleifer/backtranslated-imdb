Oh, man, I hated this movie. Granted, the place places were great, but it's about the only positive things I can say about it. Now I must immediately say that I am very critical of how weapons, especially firearms, are both portrayed and handled in movies. Being a war girl was the picture fine, but the scary weapon handling in the movie would never have been tolerated by a genuine SEAL Team. The action was more wood than my first sailboat, the equipment (or lack thereof) was ridiculous, and the dialogue was, should we say, missing something interesting. Well, except for the journalist, who was actually prescient. Seeing this movie was comparable to seeing "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they did it for sure. The scene in the water where after beating the first of the enemy struck the BLUE LADY BOAT, and thus had possible drowning, made me laugh so hard that in a millisecond I almost thought it was worth waiting through movie to. Then Charlie Sheen decided to pull the surviving enemy down to the depths of the sea (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts it looked like they went down about 80 feet. Nice continuity there ....) before he slashed his neck was so stupid stupid, I was stunned. Then again it was also the whole damned movie. I enjoy action movies but not this one. NOTE: The version I watched was a TV version, pan & scan. I can't imagine it was a difference, except to make it all blessed shorter!
