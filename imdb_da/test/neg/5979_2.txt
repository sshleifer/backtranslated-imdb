Ca. 5 minutes in the movie you are thrown into this brutally lukewarm cat and mouse romance between the two main characters, and it just gets worse from there. The biggest problem is the signs and how amazing they are. These are what 50-year-old producers and out-of-touch Hollywood scriptwriters believe that stoner life is like giving wild game to some pots. Gentle, boring, annoying and totally unrealistic. I despise this movie.
