(spoiler) It could be the worst movie you see, you like it as if I really liked it. Its one of those odds movies. <br /> <br /> There is a man who has seen a day in life. Black rats some, how feel sorry for him (which I think was a good idea). <br /> <br /> The killer rats become friends with men. Two big men are going to feel unwanted, so the man put the killer on them and the floor to floor both body covered by big black rats not so much blood. <br /> <br /> But think of big black rats all over the body) but start with some killing people, but rats go overboard until the rats kill his friends and girlfriends <br /> <br /> One scene in var sit on the toilet, while rats go into the pipes leading to the toilet and rats go up to him do you know and come out of the mouth (which means the rats must be eaten everything inside the body) I was laughing for several weeks <br /> <br /> Why did I like this movie, yes it is different for the rest, I for one like it when little creature takes on humanity. <br /> <br /> If you've seen any of these movies snails, slither, them, spiders, snakes, tremor, cujo, crocodile, shark, squid. <br /> <br /> If you liked them and check out Hood rats, <br /> <br /> the better then Terror toons that all I can say! 4.10
