Not "confusing" in the sense that "Gee, this movie is really complex and thus hard to follow!" But confusing in the sense that "Gee, this movie really has no idea what it does!" <br /> <br /> DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a collaboration between Hong Kong and South Korea, but it is quite unclear. A film about parallel universes mixed in with time travel mixed in with love story mixed with sadness. <br /> <br /> The film has the kind of concept that is bogged down the mind. Again, the mind is not bogged down because it is so large and complex, but boggles in the sense that it is so ridiculous, and one cannot imagine anyone ever coming up with such a terrible premise to begin with. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the DREAM OF A WARNER makes sense, and that's because the whole movie should never have been made. It's pretty awful. The only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior (not the female leader). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
