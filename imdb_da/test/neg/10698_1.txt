Norris plays a Chicago policeman who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to make Armegeddon well. He eventually kills the creature by getting this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about 20 feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? Then the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) child is apparently humanizing CN. OKAY. Does not work, makes no sense, and runs the plot, so-called, not a bit. In addition, no police officers are invited out of the country to be interviewed by other policemen. It is ridiculous as a prerequisite. It's all bad. Unfortunately, it is not so bad to be entertaining bad or campy. Just pretty bad. But - you can see how Norris tried to find his way to the successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
