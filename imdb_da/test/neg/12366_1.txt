I hope this is not part of the coming things. High-definition camcorders are becoming cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear it's what was used here), so it's open year for all Wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos. There is no hiding the fairness of this stinker and calling it a 'movie' would make the industry a great disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family excursion to the zoo. I could build myself a new house with all the wood business. What is remarkable is that no one stands out as worst. They are all just as terrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What hung me was the title. I am a sucker for this kind of thing, like Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also pretty bad, but at least I got some laughs out of it, and the play was only bad, not terrible. I can't comment on Monsturd as I haven't yet received a copy of it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope the people who made this didn't make any money from it. Otherwise, they may be encouraged to try it again. Please, boys, tie the camcorder and go back to your regular job.
