Updating Clare Booth Luce play and 1939 movies is a big disappointment. The casts of women are excellent, most of the individual scenes work, but nothing is related. There is no scene-to-scene connection, almost as if the film was formed in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Encouraged the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and prevented by her friends, is a less shocking one now at an age where divorce is so common but at the same time it is as early as ever, I just wish they could have managed to connect all the pieces together, because as it stands now, you really do not feel drawn together by the plot. Wait for cable.
