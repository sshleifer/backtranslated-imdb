OUCH, Nothing really needed to say anything else. This movie had actually considered me suicide. As a big fan of the wonderful genre that is a zombie movie, I found this to be the worst attempt I've ever been. The movie never actually seemed to go there! What was the meaning of it all, I felt hopeless and lost. Hell, it was so bad I can't justify it any more. I'll just hang out in the closet. OK now I tried to submit my comment, but the server only accepts comments that are ten lines or more. So here it goes ... Poor, terrible, no how close enough. NO TITS !!!!!! How can you have a zombie movie without breasts. In fact, the female leader had a hell of a tripod, and the only reason I saw the movie for completion was perhaps to get a glimpse of chance. NIX! Of course, there was a line that deserves to mention a line, I am looking forward to using myself one day (when I just feel the need to get my face beaten) "This pig won't smoke itself" This movie is bad , so bad.
