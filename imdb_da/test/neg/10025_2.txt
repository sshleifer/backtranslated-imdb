Oh yes, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the dubious price of "worst 80's slasher ever made". "The Prey" has got everything you normally want to avoid in a horror flick: a routinely derived plot that you have seen thousands of times before (and better), insufficient characters, and horrible beliefs, a complete lack of gore and excitement, fuzzy photography and unoriginal places and ?? most annoying of all ?? The greatest amount of meaningless padding you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration, but a guarantee!). Aside from the seemingly endless amount of National Geographic stock footage that I want to extend later, this movie is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) And twice where characters tell dillydally jokes that aren't even extremely fun! The layout is as rudimentary as it gets, with the intro with images of a devastating forest fire with OTT voice-over human screams. Fast forward almost forty years later when an older couple out camping in the same area gets ax-whacked by something that breathes heavily off-screen. This should be enough information for you to deduce that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained around ever since. Enter three unacceptable thieves any couple go up to the danger zone with only sex on their minds, ignorant of course sitting ducks for stalking and panting killer. "The Prey" is an irreremable boring movie. Apparently, it was shot in 1978 already, but no one wanted to distribute it until 1984, and it's not too difficult to see why. If you wanted to filter all the content that is actually relevant, it would only be a short movie with a maturity of 30 minutes; possibly even less. There is an amazingly large nature and wildlife footage, sometimes of animals, which I don't even live in that kind of area and they seem to go on forever. The only thing missing is actually the typical National Geographic tale that provides educational information on animal habits. Animals in their own natural biotope are unthinkable to look at, but not in a seemingly fake and cheesy 80's slasher film, to cry aloud. The last fifteen minutes is finally worth something, with some potent kitten sequences and fine makeup effects on the monster (which turns out to be Lurch from The Addams Family movie), but it's still silliness overrules ?? the scene with vultures is too stupid ?? and the final shot is just grin-out-loud retarded. As mentioned above, "The Prey" easily makes my own personal list of the worst 80's slashers along with "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate" " The Stay Awake "and" Curfew ".
