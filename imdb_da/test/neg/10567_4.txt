From scarcely alien sounding lasers to a primary school crash, Nightbeast is better classified as a dangerous mix of false blood and harsh breast. The almost pornographic style of the movie seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of coherent or effective history. However, the actor is not so beastly, many of the young, hopeful, actors, admirably, promote a hidden talent. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel who shed a pleasant light of light on this otherwise horrible movie. Nightbeast would never have looked up at him had he known the horrible film making talent in this little Maryland town.
