I just wrote a comment on "ACES HIGH" (1976), and it reminds me of this movie, which I looked at as a child when it was released. Since then I have seen it only once and it was more than enough. As Kevin says well, "it's a complete waste of time". Apart from the dog battles that are nicely done, the rest are a series of badly patched scenes with actors struggling with a miserable script and just as miserable. I can't remember the stupid German accents that Kevin mentions in his comment, but it's another pathetic mistake; If Corman tried to convince the German pilots more convincingly, why didn't he use German actors or have these parts baptized? On the other hand, good example of the scary Hollywood style of film making with their "villains" is clearly identifiable not only by their cruel acts but also by their grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> Talking about "cruel acts" the ridiculous scene was Lieutenant Hermann Goering murder. English nurses during an airbase attack are a completely disgusting piece of propaganda made with "historic overhaul". If you want to see a fact, move, highly-effected and directed film about the air war during WWI see "ACES HIGH" (1976) or the wonderful classic "THE DAWN PATROL" (1938), you won't be disappointed.
