LOCATION: A truck (Kristofferson) is fighting a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) by getting his colleagues to tie trucks together and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy. <br /> <br /> NEGATIVE: The movie's setup is weak and ends even weaker. It has all good-ole-boy / trucker cliches without adding anything new to the process. It ends up making SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT look brilliant and inspired. Kristofferson is all too laid back for a leading male role and cannot carry the picture. Borgnine's character is portrayed scary. Initially, he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overcomes a smaller controversy that starts the whole role. So at the end he is made to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly sits with Kristofferson, who doesn't work at all. In both cases, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. However, the worst part about the movie is director Peckinpah's attempt to throw in a "serious message" into this stupid action girl who doesn't, but lower it and bomb it in the process. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only good scene in the whole movie is the battle sequence inside the truck stop restaurant. Director Peckinpah puts a fun spin on his trademark 'slow motion' violence and the result is entertaining. Unfortunately, he begins to put the whole action into slow motion during the rest of the image until it eventually becomes tedious. McGraw is always a pleasure to watch, but unfortunately she has little to say or do. <br /> <br /> LOWDOWN: If you've read the synopsis than you've seen the "watch" movie. The song on which this movie is based is pretty good, but the film adds nothing to it and should never have been made. These are all very uninspired things for such a maverick director. RATING: 3 out of 10.
