Every movie made by Quentin Tarantino has grown worse. I would like to believe that most people agree with this statement, but seeing as "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has a 8.5 / 10 out of over 100,000 ratings, it doesn't seem that the general cinematic public has some meaning. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a 'masterpiece'. The problem is to claim that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as it happens, you get boatloads of people who are ready and willing to jump on another bandwagon. They will ignore ridiculously scary plays and utterly self-giving writing, so they can be part of the exclusive club called "All". This movie is so horrible that I swear it should be a kind of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. As another reviewer has already said, "Former Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing." I could not agree more. This movie is nothing more than self-indulgent and i-joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken straight out of a high school play. But thanks to the general movie coming public, I'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You have drawn one of the best practical jokes all the time.
