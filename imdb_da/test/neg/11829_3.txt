... and in this series I have been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, his one-line set Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He is a bald guy with inane catchphrases. Remember Rachel, "Xena, the War Princess" and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They have been transformed into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) Authors who decided the original characters were not cool enough for television. Remember the amazing extra-terrestrial ax, who was cool, intelligent, and really, really liked cinnamon buns? In this series, he is the Token Alien with an extremely annoying voice. Remember the witty booties our team had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so boring and stupid, it is obvious that the authors panned for the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> Forget about everything you thought you knew about Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to morphing, not Rachel, words of thought are * supposed * to echo, and Visser Three and Ax rarely, as ever, appear as andalets (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. Jerks are all around us. And if you are unlucky, one of them can customize one of your favorite books or series or graphic novels for a truly horrible television show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... TV worth seeing." ~ (the very bald) Visser Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
