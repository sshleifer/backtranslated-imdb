This miserable psychodrama employs every shabby unity in the book for receding attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, are not worth noting, let alone two precious hours of moviegoers. <br /> <br /> As in Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" (a fantastic movie that shows clearly "Heroes" in comparison), a late teenager is killed, leaving his family in death. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisoned the survivors' emotional well in a particularly corrosive manner. We follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months. The father (Jeff Daniels) is withdrawn, almost dumb, usually drunk stiff, who secretly takes leave from his job for months, instead sitting on a park bench all day and insisting on putting a full plate of food on the deceased son's place for each meal. He treats everyone else in the family with unerring nastiness. He sees his doctor regularly, but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his obvious dysfunctional condition never comes up. The mother (Sigourney Weaver) shouts to the neighbor's wife being busted, among other things, when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her designation) at a main store (which adult in fact would ever try such a stupid stunt?), And approaching the end in Coming with lunges, which everyone in the theater assumes is cancerous (she is a big smoker). Mrs. Weaver has a few flip lines, but generally behaves too relentlessly to deserve much empathy. <br /> <br /> It is not that there are no people out there who behave in these stupid ways when serious stressful circumstances arise. But why make a movie of such drift? What can anyone learn from the couple's behavior? <br /> <br /> The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is out of college and is too happy to refrain from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is genuine, it causes multifold, and his behavior is coherent under the circumstances. But Hirsch's character is too gently spoken, for morose and knocked down to carry the film. The other bit of players, sub-texts and cutesy, unreal dialogue does not help. <br /> <br /> The suicide theme echoes almost unclearly in the case of two other minor characters. So what is the author director, Dan Harris, trying to say about this topic? That it is not a serious issue? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play a father's juice as written in this script is something only his therapist might be able to answer. Avoid this dog. Instead, rent Redford's classic. My rating: 4/10 (C-). (Set on 2/17/05). If you would like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.
