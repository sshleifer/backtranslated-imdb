I lived next to the author in 1980 when he first moved to Portland from Downer's Grove, Ill. With two of his colleges. He seemed like a normal enough guy, even though he had a lot of artistic pretensions. Within a couple of years, he jumped into Portland's post-punk music scene with buddy Phil and a few others, and a band that was definitely not going anywhere, even though it got him a lot of actions, including a fling with Courtney Love in her Portland group day. He seemed to think his musical outlook was good enough to move to San Francisco, so N.Y.C. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to hear that he got a publishing contract in 1995 after the band crashed and burned. Courtney Love's name seemed to be clincher. I have no idea how the movie came, especially with this cast, but I doubt Gus Van Sant was involved. Nevertheless, reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is conscious or not, so I just want to say that this is the work of a pretty intelligent guy who wants to be an author or artist or something, but don't do it 'I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without Benzedrine.
