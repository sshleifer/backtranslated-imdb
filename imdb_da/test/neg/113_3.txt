A group of heirs to a mysterious ancient mansion find out that they must live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinfected, but they quickly find out the story of everyone who had lived there before they either died in strange accidents or having killed each other. <br /> <br /> You've seen everything before and this is too low a budget and slowly being scary and has no real surprises in the climax. No special effects or talk about, in fact, the only really entertaining thing about the whole movie is the quality of the English dubbing, which is sometimes as bad as a cheap martial arts film. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10, pretty low in choppy order of 80's haunted house movies.
