While this is not one of Miss Davies' worst movies, it's pretty bad. And it is sad that the recent IMDb riders deliberately over-lit the score on some of her films in a revisionist manner to make it easier for her to be weak in the past - or so. For years, conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a horrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau, William Randolph Hearst, bought his way to Hollywood. This is certainly the image created in Orson Welles' NEXT CAN. It is true that Hearst used his great wealth and complaint to build Davie's career. With all this money, it is not surprising that she made some great movies, and it is not surprising that people got snippy because of all the extra attention she got. Sleeping with the man who finances your movies has to be noticed. However, despite this, she also made a decent number of bad movies, and I think we really need balance when it comes to the score of her movie. After all, there could be no rational person to believe that PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies movies recently featured on Turner Classic Movies (FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserved the exceptionally high score - place them higher than such movies as HIGHLIGHTS, BEN HOW, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE AND EVERYONE SETTING UP THE WEST FRONT !! In fact, MARIANNE would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to IMDb with a score of 8.8 !!! Considering most people out there don't even know who Marion Davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters, this is a serious problem !! However, she was a much better actress than BORG KANE implied and began to break into movies before she began to sleep with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What sets PEG O 'MY HEART apart from these two other movies is what MARIANNE and FLORODORA GIRL were cozy little movies - while PEG O' MY HEART in some ways is just awful. Much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of Marion. While her French accent in MARIANNE was sweet, in PEG her Irish accent sounded just bizarre - not very Irish. Plus, and maybe I'm wrong, but her continuous use of the word 'ye' makes her sound like she should do Shakespeare, not a movie in 1933 Ireland! There was also a bizarre insistence that Marion was the perfect talented star - so they had not only act but dance and sing. The song actually fits scripts into some of her movies, but here it seemed out of place and seriously degraded by the movie. It just seemed like you could almost hear Hearst shouting "see - she's a great actress --- watch her sing and dance". Unfortunately, Marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes. But for me, the biggest problem was the idea of ​​having 36-year-old Marion, who plays such a youthful role. It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the movie was supposed to be like Mary Pickford played in teens and twenties - complete with pigtails and beautiful settings. Miss Pickford could perform these roles, even though she was no longer a girl. But here Marion had put some weight and then at least 30. No offense - she looked fine for her age - but she did not look like a teenager! <br /> <br /> Strangely, with the millions that hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fits Marion's talents. Believe me, I have rated several of her films very highly (I especially love SHOW PEOPLE), but here she could just help flop - this movie was a turkey.
