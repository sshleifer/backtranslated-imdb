Yep, Edward G. gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world. First he is a flooded prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, albeit short of DeForrest Kelly), then he is so full of remorse that his only consolation is the bottle. Throw in a combed romance, a real quick descent into penury and no nausea about who he defends, and the next thing you know - Shazam! Black Leg Attorney (God I love this sentence). He sees the light just in time to save his beloved loved one from the chair. Grazing. But really, the courtroom action is pure melodrama. See him punch a witness, see him drink poison, see him argue passionately as he connects a ball hole in his chest. Be prepared for the melodrama. <br /> <br /> However, the hearing of the movie is Jayne Russell. With curves that dictate gravity requirements and an IQ approaches absolutely zero, she is something to see. Self sings a little.
