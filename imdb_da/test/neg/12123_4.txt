Think Jumanji, but with a curse. A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that kills one who plays it. It was apparently made of a witch's skin during the Spanish Inquisition and carries an unpleasant curse. <br /> <br /> Okay, undemanding and just some kind of cool story isn't something you haven't seen before. Clearly, it has been there and made the story that hits all the right buttons in such a way that they have no real surprises. Far from the worst that SyFy has run, but it's certainly not the best. There are better choices out there, but if this is your only choice, you won't completely hate it.
