I'm sorry, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that after making the first in the series, they could get a budget to make another. Not that the budget could have been a lot - it's the smallest scary movie I've ever seen and laugh at the end (in fact I can't believe we saw it to the end), but I think it's because we couldn't. on.
