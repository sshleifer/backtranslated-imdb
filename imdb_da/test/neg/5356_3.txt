Normally, I will applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this movie is a kind of parody of ninja movies. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just couldn't. The wit is not fun enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese movies. And most of the times I like and understand the humor used in these movies. "Red Shadow" is just stupid!) The characters portrayed in this movie by that this is not a serious movie and shows that everything is about the fun. Look at the characters from parodies such as "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is made with a straight face and never falls out of character! And because of this, some scenes are fun and fun. In "Red Shadow" the players never get it. Shadow ninja should be very skilled and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors do not do their best to convince us of their talents. They don't do things with a straight face. The wit would have worked better if they did! The bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the experience for me. I like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "Red Shadow" just fails in that department. So what's there to be enjoyed. Now the music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be like the action it itself is never exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. Using humor, lack of history and depth makes me believe that this movie is for children. But I wonder if children actually want this movie. A waste of time!
