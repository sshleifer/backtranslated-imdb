Scott's collection of 80s icons cannot save this teenage disaster. But then I assume it was only a TV movie and not a big movie picture. William A. Schwartz (author) comes up with something closer to "Stewardess School", except this movie is more boring. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and completely plot-free. The only reason to see this may be to see Tina Yothers in an actual role after family ties. After this movie and just stupid "Class Cruise", I assume that Mr. Scott was wised and went back to managing sit-coms, which was his best move yet. 4 out of 10
