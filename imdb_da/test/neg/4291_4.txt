First, I must point out that Wendell Corey's role was unusual. Normally, Corey was referred to supporting roles, but here he is, what helps to carry this very light film. Without him and the character he played, the movie would have been much worse - hardly deserving a 2 or 3. <br /> So why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my pet fever is when signs seem "too stupid to live". You cannot base large plot points on the assumption that your protagonists are completely stupid (unless you have a brain injury is part of the plot of course). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a madman who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next goal is Joseph Cotts wife. So what do they do? Yes, they really do provide insufficient police protection and a plan that doesn't make sense at all (no man and the guys with shotguns that are so far away, they probably won't stop this madman). And if this is not bad, the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and goes straight into the worst possible place she could be! Does anyone stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate when movies have such stupid characters. In fact, I found myself rooting for Corey when I felt idiots deserving to die for their behavior! In addition to these clich√© documents, there was also a little player who fainted. Sure to see your husband shot ME to get someone weak, but in reality this is a rare occurrence - people rarely weaken unless there is a medical reason. So combining this with the above character issues is a real nightmare for people looking for realism - any Film Noir movie should have. <br /> <br /> All these serious issues are even more disturbing as Wendell Corey's character is incredibly well-written and conceived. It was his chance to shine as an actor - for badly the rest of the movie was so sad that Corey and the basic plot idea were sinking. This is a movie that can really use a remake - but this time without brainless signs.
