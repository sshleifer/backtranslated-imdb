This is one of the "family" movies that I can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over approx. 9. A group of siblings discover a "sandfe" (yes really) conveniently located at the end of a non-secret passage in the home of their eccentric uncle as they have been evacuated from London's flash. ... And there you have it, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of having wishes fulfilled, but none of these issues are investigated in a way that would be of interest to adults or educational for children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think of to see this is to see how strong Freddie Highmore's excellent talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre notions.
