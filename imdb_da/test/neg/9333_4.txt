"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you just had to go and look back at the end of the 50s when I was a child: a biblical epic spectacular with well-known artists, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. Then I went to see it; but I remember that "Solomon and Sheba" did not impress me at all, which was a strange thing when I had enjoyed much "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helen of Troy" and others. The point is that when you are a child, you ignore things in pictures that adults do not (for example, bad action) and you are easier to please with warriors in their armor, fighting, sword duels and action, so if you are not impressed, then something is wrong with a product of this genre. <br /> <br /> Even though it has some of these features, this movie is absolutely standard and average. Yul Brynner's wood performances as the Hebrew king do not even shine when he has a successful and half-naked Gina Lollobrigida dancing around him provocatively. She is better and makes an acceptable play. George Sanders doesn't look interested in what he's doing, and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) doesn't add anything like a conscience's conscience. The final sword duel between Brynner and Sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity (it had to be filmed, that's all). Not a good farewell to director King Vidor, Salomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as Ty Power's last unfinished image.
