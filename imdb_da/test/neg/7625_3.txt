weird.this is a television movie, but the rating on the box says it is rated R. There is nothing in the movie that would qualify for a R rating aside from it, but the movie is very slow and meaningless. I think the idea was good, but nothing was done with storyline.it was just not developed. It is mildly scary, and the play is actually pretty good, better than the movie deserves. I can't see myself seeing it again anytime soon, if ever. There have been other films dealing with the same concept, which is better made than this one. I haven't seen too many Wes Craven Films, so I can't really compare it to any of his others.as for this movie though but I think it's poorly conceived and poorly executed. For me, I can't give Chiller a higher rating than 3/10
