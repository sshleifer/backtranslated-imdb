Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him. I always liked her image and his ability to act in such danger as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you want with Rourke - meaning, mood and dirty. But this movie gives you much more - and you don't want to have most. <br /> <br /> First of all - it just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who, after killing a bus load of school children, flies Ireland to London. He is on the run from the police and from his own companions. He also promised never to kill again. It seems that the bus full of kids finally did it for him. <br /> <br /> But when he arrives in London, he is tracked by a local mobster (Bates - looks like his eyebrows and his hair came straight out of a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor again for Â£ 50,000 and a boat trip to USA. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do so but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and acknowledges the crime to him in the confession to keep the priest's mouth closed. He shows that it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> A wealth of things arise here that just don't add: <br /> <br /> 1. Why choose Rourke for your competition? As illustrated by a scene where an employee is attached to a wall of a few weights with what resembles aces - these are London men enough to make their own killings. <br /> <br /> 2. Not only that, but Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of handling Rourke? <br /> <br /> 3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police allow him to go outside - without protection, can I add - to get acquainted? No way. <br /> <br /> 4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he performed the murder) immediately after the crime takes place to confess. Why doesn't the police control the place? <br /> <br /> 5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskins blind niece especially in days after, without anyone bothering him. What? He's on the move, and he keeps on going where he committed another murder? Stupid. <br /> <br /> 6. The police actually meet Rourke in the church "cling" the body and have no idea who he is. Don't they know he's on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check on him? <br /> <br /> 7. Why does Rourke kill for you and then tell him to wait a few days to get on the boat? You would think you would get rid of him right away. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /> <br /> 8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the middle of everything? Could he not hold back for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safe expelled to the states? Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 9. Rourke's sudden inner turmoil after all his years of killing and winning over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he's a killer, she still loves him? Again - totally ridiculous. And besides - she falls in "love" with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /> <br /> 10. Whole bomb stuff at the end is simply stupid from Bate's point of view. <br /> <br /> 11. Things happen in parts of this movie that just don't make sense or are simply in there to help the story (and I say it in jest) together. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail, and Rourke suddenly shows a moral pitch to respect the hearth of the house - yet it will become a blind girl. <br /> <br /> 12. Rourke asks a hand on the boat where Bates is - and the handler almost skips his movements in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy told Rourke much more than he himself asked. <br /> <br /> 13. Hoskins priest is a former army guy and we see him beat up three minions behind a pub. I'm totally unsolicited and yet another cringe-worthy scene. I will stop there by unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so fake red it is ridiculous), his accent (which, to be fair is not so bad sometimes, but deteriorates into a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes , walk looks to the sky, etc. I also don't want to mention the music and the choppy editing style. <br /> <br /> Oooppps - I just mentioned them. <br /> <br /> All in all - A disaster in a movie with some obvious religious images thrown in (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) that would frighten a first-year movie stud star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
