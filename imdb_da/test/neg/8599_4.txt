Now I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also enjoy the toilet humor <br /> <br /> Such as Young Ones and Bottom etc. However, this has not succeeded in bringing a little smile to my face. The story follows Johnny around for his wife <br /> <br /> chucks him out (how he got his beautiful wife and child, I don't know) <br /> <br /> when he tries to shag something moving . Failing normally. I was looking forward to this, but found it quite boring and wasted my time altogether. Unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 minutes apart from washing the car then don't bother ..... <br /> <br />
