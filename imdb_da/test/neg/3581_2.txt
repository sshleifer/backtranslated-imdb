I don't know what happened to Director Abel Ferrara. Ever since the "Body Snatchers" remake, he seems to have lost it. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best films in the 90s: searing accusations of a decade gone wrong. With movies like "R Xmas" (whatever it means) and "New Rose Hotel" he seems willing to wake up and drill his former followers. This movie has no life in it. While getting excellent performances from his actors in all his projects, the result of this mishmash of ideas is simply not jell. Whatever the point is - that the new breed of drug trafficking is more or less the same as any other top middle class New Yawkuh - lost in the insane writing and boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at the 4-seat downtown LA In the lobby while buying tickets, I was surprised and pleased to see it filled with a huge, racial group of men and women in their twenties and the thirties. Then they started into the theater, but it was the theater that was "8 Mile" not "R Xmas"! The theater shows' 'R Xmas' (remember, this was opening night!) Had a total of 4 people to see it, myself, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> Way to go, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
