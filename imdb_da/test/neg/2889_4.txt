*** SPOILER ALERT *** Unfortunate and confusing arson drama that has to do with a creepy plan to burn down a great vacation resort before New Years Day. Being insured for $ 10 million is the man behind Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains of Australia, Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, determined to bring his own project down to flame. This must be done no later than January 1, two weeks before the insurance policy on the project expires. <br /> <br /> In his opinion entirely on his work builder and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt, has no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, is planning to burn the resort he builds and possibly set him up as the fall man . Anderson becomes a little suspicious when insurance researcher Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs him of some highly fished goings between Fane and the insurance company Stolt Alliance. It turns out that Proud Allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by Fane himself! This explains that vallefane has all these fire fires to collect the ten million dollar insurance that is at least twice as much as the entire Valley View Estates are worth! <br /> <br /> We later murdered Sophie McCann in a failed swimming accident to keep her out of finding out what is happening to the suspicious fries around and in Valley View Estates. That's when Lloyd's of London, who signs the Proud Alliance, insurance researcher George Engles, James Mason, shows that Fane takes a powder that leaves his ace firefighter alone and out of control to blow Fane's entire plane. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anderson has been wise for both Fane and Angels, who, unlike Fane, want Valley View Estates to go under for reasons never made quite clear, just watch the last few seconds of the movie to realize that it is author and director. The arsonist is exposed as he is about to make his girlfriend with Anderson come to his rescue. We have seen this wild chase scene with the arsonist lost in the Valley View construction site only to have it fired by Howard Anderson, where he ends up burning to a crisps at the time the fire department came to snake The sudden and inexplicable ending never made clear to what happened to Big Cheese throughout this form of things, the vicious and evil minded Julian Fane. It's as if Fane got away from Scot-Free, and only his unstable and counterfeit hands, the arsonist, who was only the instrument of Cane's crimes, ended up being the only one to pay from them.
