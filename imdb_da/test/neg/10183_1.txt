I came across this movie during channel surfing, and it seemed to be another badly made Christian movie about The End Times (which I find pretty entertaining because they take so seriously). To be fair I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and sci-fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and frightening representation of the Christian faith as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a movie, the script was terrible, the action was mediocre, and the pacing was poor. Cinematography and direction were sub-pairs: no interesting visuals, no layered plot line, no creativity. Don't just blame it on the budget - the movies can still be interesting without special effects. It wasn't. Christian films cannot apologize for their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian". <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is aimed at Christians ** <br /> <br /> First, it is unethical for any company to bait and switch your customers. I don't like being told I can only win a free iPod to realize I need $ 300 on participating stores first. Non-Christians do not like being told that they are watching a Sci-Fi movie and then being bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtleties of a sledgehammer. Hidden agenda does not win you any friends, much less convert. <br /> <br /> Secondly, you shouldn't use open threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented Christians came out as troubled, sneaky bullies in connection with the skeptical "unbeliever" - they even go as far as possible to scare the cleanup to scare him into believing. Representative Dialogue: "Turn to Jesus - OR GO TO HELL!" "Fine, don't believe me - but you will be angry!" "The day you die, I can guarantee that you will pay more attention to this Jesus thing - when you land at HELLEN'S BELLY!" OK, I can exaggerate, but it certainly came the same way. If you think this is a "clear message to Christ," you are wrong. I don't remember Jesus by threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians, please do not use this as a "witness tool" to your "missed" friends. It is heavy-handed, offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was poor. In addition to characterizing Jesus as a means of hell insurance, it left no room for debate or discussion and did not attempt to involve the question of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, it offered a pat answer: "UFOs are the devil's plan to deceive people when rapture happens" which is neither biblically nor widely accepted by most Christians. As the Bible does not mention UFOs or foreigners, you cannot use it as a source to draw conclusions in one way or another. Cleanup is not necessarily even a widely accepted, audio-Bible concept, but today most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers suggest), the idea of ​​two Christian descendants (the first as cleanup) is a relatively new phenomenon in church tradition, popular with some travel evangelists around the 20th century revolution. Most of the Orthodox Christians will likely find this movie's message to be a fairly large stretch based on many unforeseen assumptions. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie lacks the mark both as a valuable entertainment piece and as a precise representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
