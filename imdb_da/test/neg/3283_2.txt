If you haven't seen the "home war," let me tell you what you lacked. It's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only have been edgy and fun in the 60s. Where America has grown to accept race, sexual preference, religion, etc., this show seems to argue for that progress. It is a recurring step in America's development. For example, one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that the white daughter is dating a black child from school. Of course, it's fun to see how you can't see that kind of relationship in any gallery in America. I have lived in both small towns and big cities, so don't give me a kind of red condition, blown up excuse. Not only is this joke, but the father, who is not racist, finds it disturbing and asks his daughter repeatedly to break up with her boyfriend who opposes "he may sound like a racist, but he is just stupid" character. <br /> <br /> If that's not enough, another ongoing joke is that one of the sons, and soon the metro-sexual, is ambiguous in their sexual orientation. The audience learns over and over again that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced that he constantly avoids his son, fearing that his son will strike him, since all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men who can Don't Check Their Will The Father always comes to a certain acceptance of his son, once per year. Show, but usually continues to avoid him in the following episode. The only way this show can heal in my eyes is if the continuous exposure to these "unnatural events in life" opens the father's eyes a little, but it may be too much to ask - and besides jokes like these, I'm sure we get hilarity in episodes to come as - Episode 13, "Father votes against women's voters" and episode 14, "My Muslim neighbor is a terrorist". <br /> <br /> Please drop this show, FOX. We live in a different world than your executive grew up in.
