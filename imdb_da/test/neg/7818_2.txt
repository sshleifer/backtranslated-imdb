For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher makes the worst movie mistake in her career since 'Dude, where's my car?' Tara Reid co-stars as Ashton's dream, who asks him to babysit her father (and his boss) sweet owl at the weekend. The rules: 1. No shoes in the house. 2. No people in the house. 3. The boss's son gets out of the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Now, you can basically guess at the end of the first twenty minutes how the rest of the movie will show up. <br /> <You know there are movies like "Meet The Parents" where bad things happen to anyone, but it is entertaining to see and it is delivered in a way that you can't wait to see what happens next time. This is not one of those films. You know right from the start that bad things will happen and they are mostly stupid things that would never happen. It is a very frustrating movie to watch and there were about three times when I almost knocked it off because it was so bad. But I paid the rent and figured that I had to see it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good and I want to see her in several movies. Although I am not surprised if this had a hand in hurting his career. The end result is a happy ending ... but of course with that kind of movie you expect nothing short of it. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. You will sincerely regret it!
