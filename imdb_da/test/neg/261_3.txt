When I read reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, "Huh?" It was confusing. To be sure, I went to see the movie and what do you know? It's a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been changed to fit the whole essence of Indianness, but the rest is a direct boost from the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but it's so bad it just hurts me to see it. I groaned so much on this and I realized I was not the only one who did it! A guy actually went out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop making comedy roles. He screams and whines too much. Why can't he just take it easy? He does not do justice to the role that Adam Sandler originally performed. He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she is not Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Pugalia") does not match Barrymore's version ("Hi, I'm Mrs Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed to see that scene, even though I had loved the original. The music is not that bad. It is probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible movie! Avoid this at all costs!
