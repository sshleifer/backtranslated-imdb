This movie was disturbing, not because of the subject, but because of the way it was handled. The extremely obese mother (Angela) didn't even put it on the cover of the videotape, as most of the rest of the cast did. This is not fair, but is a statement in itself. I also notice that her picture is missing from IMDb (perhaps her own choice) and it seems that this is her only movie ever? The language of this movie was crude than necessary. Looked at my 10 year old son because it was rated PG in Canada and the language coming out of their mouth was shameful & disgusting. Never appreciated Shirley Maclain as so many others think. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and always want. The Chinese part was annoying. <br /> <br /> The little boy Alex is a great little actor. I have to see what he has been lately.
