A commentator said if you like Austin Powers, you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The movie seems hard, maybe too hard to laugh. Perhaps it was that all the bad guys in this movie shouted as if the scream itself supposed to be fun. I come where they tried to go with this flick. A cross between Zorro and Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just doesn't work. Austin strengthens if stupid but intelligent, Zorro Gay Blade lacks the savvy of Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for a laugh and waited for myself surprised that someone was actually paid for the manuscript. My 15 year old daughter also thought the movie was flat. My 17-year-old who chose this flick on his title went out after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people at IMDb liked this movie, but for me it lacked good timing or jokes of a good comedy.
