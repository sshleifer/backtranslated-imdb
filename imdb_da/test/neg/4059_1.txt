This is undoubtedly the WORST sequel I've ever seen and I've seen lots of them to get that conclusion. The reason is simply ridiculous. I can catch a ball and run around a field too. Why can't I play in the Superbowl? Yes I know that this movie was intended for children, but there are just some reasons that even children can realize are quite stupid and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but one was a total breakdown. Disney loses it. If I checked who won the Razzie Awards, I'd give this a couple. Have a good day! =)
