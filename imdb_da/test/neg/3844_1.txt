It was clear that the comments above, which were above the film, were made by one on the crew. I don't ever remember watching a movie that is more offensive to the talented actors or audience to watch. In my 30 years of watching movies, it's the only one I've ever gone out of. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot etc. Note to manufacturer: It's never fun to hunt people based on race. Great that you were trying to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still looking for people based on race and it's sick.
