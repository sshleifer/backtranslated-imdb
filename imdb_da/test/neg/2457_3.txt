The only thing that is more filled with gaps than the premise of this movie is its script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's brilliant, flamboyant, lack of talent. The plot is completely illogical, but super fake, and everything is crafted within an inch of its life in the most cliché, overheated way. I love how the middle school autopsy room is a hollow vaulted marble mausoleum with low light in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland runs a canvas-backed army jeep. No one in Joel Schumacher's movie lives in an unusual way. It is always an alternative universe, where everyone is young and painfully hip, but strictly and obsessively according to a medieval billionaire man's idea of ​​hip. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin's brother # 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he slept with, as the inton "I call you" and "I just need space" is the funniest friggin 'thing in the whole universe !!!! What kind of world do we live in where Joel Schumacher gets to keep people throwing money on him? "Flatliners" have caused me to review man's entire oeuvre solely for the kind of high performance yuks contained therein.
