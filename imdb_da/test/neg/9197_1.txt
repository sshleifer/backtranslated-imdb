I'm sorry maybe, it's part of the wave of praise for firefighter since 911, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it's not supposed to knock off your socks, but I'm sorry this movie is terrible. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least so many clichés. It's a boring story (impressive to be sad when there are dangerous fires and livers being rescued) about a firefighter. And his boring life told in a meaningless 'scene from now' flashback to the former style. We start the movie with the hero in danger in a collapsing burning building. The whole movie is about trying to make us love this guy, so we squeeze out a few tears when he meets his end in the final of the scene from the start of the movie. I found it difficult to care for and wished he had previously gone into smoke. Cliches are abundant as - best friend's death, love at first place, howling in a new job, first-born, a worried wife with a man with a dangerous job, a grandfather boss / superior, 2.4 children (well over 2 but close enough) , sacrifice your life to save others, prices for bravery .... further and further. It is every firefighter's life, any police officer, nurse, doctor in one way or another. It was lazy if it was supposed to be a 'life flashing to the eye' when he died, so God helps the poor guy, I'm surprised he doesn't suck in more smoke to go faster. Flashbacks are mostly earthly and predictable, dully acted and with a soundtrack that could put The Laughing Cow out of business, it was so cheesy, it actually sounded like muzak or copyright free elevator stuff !!! Avoid at all costs unless you need something to look at with a Sunday night. Or maybe if you're related to a firefighter - warning - your life will end up terribly, or you'll be scared for life if you're a brave firefighter according to this movie. Unless your John Travolta (strange velcro style hair in this one !!)
