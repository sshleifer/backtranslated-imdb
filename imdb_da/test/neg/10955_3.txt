The production company for this movie calls itself 'Nott Entertainment', and it's a surprisingly appropriate name. This is very 'Nott' entertaining from start to finish, which is a shame because a mix of zombie film and western could have been interesting. Every time a low-budget zombie movie is released, it will be "for the fans of the fans". I consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but for many more like this, and I will re-evaluate my opinion! The movie seems to be a rip-off of the half-decent Aussie zombie flick 'Undead', expecting just to have the lead in a cowboy hat; Everyone is wearing one but it does not make much sense because the film seems to be set in modern times. The Credits sequence at the beginning of the movie fools us into believing that we will be in favor of an atmospheric movie, but when the movie starts correctly; It soon becomes clear what we really are in. Of course, there are a lot of things to do, and it is actually quite well done, although the good things I have to say about the film are pretty much ending there. There is a twist halfway through which could have been interesting if the rest of the movie was. All in all, it's just another zombie movie in a world with too many zombie movies. I do not recommend it.
