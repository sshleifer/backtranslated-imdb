When I had avoided watching the movie in the cinema, but bought the DVD for my wife for Christmas, I had to see it. I don't expect much, which usually means I get more than I negotiated for. But 'Mamma Mia' - complete, completely cr **. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this movie is just awful. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but these races along with songs that rushed one after another, no characterization, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD), were only thrown away with only half of the The body Ever on the screen, the dance squad from the North Americans appears on a small Greek island on will, while the set and set-up of numbers would have confused Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties! Meryl (see me I'm acting) Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her big piece - 'The winner takes it all' - is Meryl on the Met! Note to the instructor - it should have been shot in silence with the camera, which gradually shows the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the song is horrible karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. You can never settle down and just enjoy the music, the enthusiasm and the characters. But what's even worse is how this botched piece of excre **** has become the highest grossing movie in the UK and the best selling DVD to start? Blair, Campbell and New Labor have really reduced Britain to zombies - critical faculties anyone ???
