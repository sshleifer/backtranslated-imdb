Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and the ethereal sense of the movie were sublime. It just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonists. Being caught in her imagination, there is never a sense of danger as opposed to, says David Lynch's film haunting every time. This also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at. Who would it be with? <br /> <br /> Of course, Mirror mask will draw comparisons with the maze with the teen-anxiety / fantasy theme, but unfortunately it doesn't come close to delivering the same Henson essence. The sick mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while making eye candy. <br /> <br /> Not agonizingly horrible to leave The Cell, not as engaging dreamy as Labyrinth - a forgettable but good-looking fantasy.
