Some years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are actually the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I watched this movie in a sneak preview, and left after half an hour. Couldn't stand anymore. How can you make an interesting movie about people who constantly tell each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are .........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I, still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle, who didn't know the war was over. How he would suddenly appear in the movie and would start emptying his M16 by the characters in the movie. The red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the movie ........... So I was not so much gripped by this movie! Time to leave!
