A film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, filmed in beautiful surroundings, managed to present a horrible trivial and clich√©d production, roughly clumsy script, poor continuity, intrusive slushy music, sugary casting and pallid acting. <br /> <br /> It was a throw up between the script and the action that was worse. The script has probably won - the historical background, backstory and character description was spelled out in painful details in the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe quite how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> In a pre-release screening, there was a massive emigration from about thirty minutes into. In an hour, many of those left behind laughed aloud. I must add, I am a frankophile, I am fascinated by Canada and love historical film. This was really sometime.
