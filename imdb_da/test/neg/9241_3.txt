Harmony Korrine - Hates or Hates Him? On this proof, loathe can be a better word. Not him of course, just everything he does. But it could have been so different because the first ten minutes of this movie promise so much, including a great idea that a Michael Jackson impersonator will fall in love with a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Fantastic. And set in Paris! This could be fantastic. But unfortunately, Korrine can rub the odd decent idea, but because he is a horrible writer, the story fails at all levels, and the audience outbreak I knew in an hour is proof that he is the most boring and pretentious movie out there. Apparently the excursion rate at its premiere last year was Cannes festival quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two main characters, he changes the story stupidly to a castle's borders to introduce a bunch of other impersonators that make the whole experience dull and narrative unclear. When will the independent cinema stop funding this startup?
