If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in serious danger. I'm a big fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of bad, but there's not a letter in the alphabet that could describe this rancid piece of stuck puke enough. This movie even goes "so bad it's good" phase and goes on to "so bad that your world will seem a little less meaningful to having seen it" phase. It's hard to say what's more disturbing: .1. The fact that the people who wrote this believed their political satire (I use the term very, very, very loosely) was twig enough to film. They were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this waste for obviously little or no money. That someone actually thought it would be a good idea to choose this step for distribution on a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I was a weaker one, I would most likely have attached grapefruit spoons in my eyes and then blindly threw me to my death in conflicting traffic after seeing this. As it says, I live, but I'm always horrified by the experience.
