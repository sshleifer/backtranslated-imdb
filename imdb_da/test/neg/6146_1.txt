In addition to the fact that Skylar is a complete shower bag and his disadvantages are imaginative, his schemes require far too much preparation to make any of his scams worthwhile. Without renouncing any spoilers (as if it matters with this piece of shit), his disadvantage is such a shame because it requires effort of days and days of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and a whole camera crew member, etc. Just to scam someone for a service that costs less than a hundred bucks ..... moreover, if you read in the credits, they reappear some of the phone calls, etc. because they do not jump out ... The whole concept of this show is bunk Because all his disadvantages have the cost of both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual price of the service he is trying to get for free ... what is con?
