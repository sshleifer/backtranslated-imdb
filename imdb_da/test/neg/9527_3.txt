The story I understand is "based on real events." It can either be good or bad, depending on what kind of permission is taken with the right events and how they are done. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to gag a maggot. I don't expect much to go in - anticipating a story of rich high school kids who take a sea cruise under a hedgerow. It was what I expected was a movie in the future that looks like something about boot camp or basic training, this kind of drill sergeant says, "My duty is to get you out of your massive civilian roads." Well, that's the way it is. The kids begin as children and end up as an organic group. But it's a lot of hokies than any boot-camp movie I've ever seen outside of a conscious comedy. Who works this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in third grade. The dialogue interferes with the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does a better than average job, but then his performance is mediocre. He brings nothing extra to that part, even though he has given his lines, it is hard to know how he could do much with them. The rest of the casting is undefeated and a couple of the kids are painfully inadequate. There is very tearing up and very crying. The best scene involves a dolphin. <br /> <br /> The immature clich√©s continue to last. The Coast Guard is thrown into the hard-hearted court's role at the hearing following the disaster. The interrogator does nothing but beats Bridges upside down with his erroneous interpretations and misunderstandings of events. "You let the crew drink alcohol, don't you?" (A couple of harmless drinks.) "And you don't punish them even if you punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin business.) The technical details of the sinking are left scary. What is a "white squall" anyway? And if it's just as dangerous as Bridges claims, why wasn't the whole crew warned and wearing a vest? But why continue? If the "Albatross" was a Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and immersed by the ridiculous comic book.
