I've always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he has achieved and his film. Because even though I had meant to watch this movie, for some reason it had no chance. Apparently I didn't miss much. This must be one of Chuck's worst movies. So this trucker, Billy Dawes (Augenstein) gets the chance to get his delivery, but on the way he is detained and forced into a jerkwater town where a stupid locally corrupt judge (Murdock) who runs the whole city has arrested him and fake Prosecutor brought him up. He denies the charges and runs for it. The local hick police beat him and he disappears. But now his brother, JD John Dawes (Norris) is going another truck looking for him. He quickly finds that the city is run, buy it loser judge, and that his brother is no place to find. Not long after he begins to beat almost everyone in the city. Meanwhile, the woman's movie calls local truckers on a CB radio, and they all rush into the city. LOL with that big rigs. Eventually, Norris finds her brother and beats several tough guys. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. In fact, it starts okay and you are fine when Norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt police because there are such losers. But there is almost no history, the play is bad, and the end? .. it is not right. The judge has hit his house in a large rig, and you never know what is happening. Does he live? Norris doesn't even get him rubbish. Meanwhile, Norris takes some of a spokesman at the end. So what? Norris also manages to take over everyone in the city, gets his hand broken and shot in the side and continues to fight. Come on! This movie was apparently made for cash at CB then, so there was someone behind me. They even use the CBs in the movie. The addition to this seems to draw the film near the end and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you get bored and need something to see it, it will pass the time. As far as Norris he continued to make much better movies than this. 3 out of 10
