"Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's the Party's Death!" Should I say more? Scarecrow gone wild got four out of ten stars from me for a single reason: apart from the terrible actions, plot holes, cheap special effects and anti-climactic whistling, it was movie gold! I think this movie could have been really good if scarecrow turned out to be a baseball coach (as portrayed by the ever so brilliant Ken Shamrock). But then again they would have had to cut the amazing electricity effects of the Jedi power plant. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, my friends and I were convinced that it was actually written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teen-year-old boy. This movie has topless women, miserable false gore and dialogue that could not have spoken out of a paper bag or in this case a grain field. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the filmmaker one thing, that would be this; "How much did you have to pay the teenager who wrote this to you?"
