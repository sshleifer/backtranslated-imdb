Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that a woman had a hand in this horrible "woman's image" and I think that is the worst possible way. The problem is, it could have been so good if they had left out the Jane Eyre stuff and attached to the much more interesting scenes involving the Spanish / Portuguese Jews in early 19th century London. When the audio track music is better than the movie, you know you're having trouble. As you speed up the video because you can't stop the movie, just to make sure you don't miss out on something, you're in even worse trouble. This film will end on the Romanesque television channel where it rightly belongs.
