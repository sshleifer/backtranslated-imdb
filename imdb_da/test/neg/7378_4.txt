First of all, I am in the United States <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought it was an obvious and abominable rip off of "The Office" (UK). So I would have given it zero stars, but see it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series. It is still difficult to see this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the American "Office") without comparison. It's just not even close to being the same. <br /> <br /> I want to give it some credit for being original and ahead of time. I would also say that - and the United States "Office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satires. The British "office" is somewhat larger and more transcendent, as if populated with real people in events that felt they had actually happened. But unlike this or the sharp Christopher Guest "mockumentaries" it is not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" is definitely. <br /> <br /> Be it possible, "The Newsroom" is still not very fun. It is secluded and self-conscious, but with a caste and crew that is not as smart or talented enough to raise the goods. It is weighty comedy that is worn on weak shoulders. Commendable, but ultimately not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what about the lack of an anamorphic DVD? I know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen because I saw the pilot section on one of our HD channels. CBC, bring the program. ; )
