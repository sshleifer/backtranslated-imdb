On the way home from a day on the beach, four young people seek a cloudless downpour in the Lord's and Lady Alexander's homes after their car runs out of gas. They do not know it, but the house they are holding is the place for a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only woman in the group, must be sacrificed. As her male companions urgently need her help, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things really get out of hand, and everyone else who participates in the black mass is also killed. The four are trying to escape, but soon discover, there is no escape from what they have seen. One by one they meet their fate. <br /> <br /> Gong in the Tragic Ceremony, I was positive, I would enjoy it. Slow-burning gothic horror is right up in my alley. I'm also very fond of some of Riccardo Freda's other films like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost, and Vampiri. Tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work as they should. The biggest tragedy of the tragic ceremony is the time I spent watching this mess on a movie. With a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me. The signs are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is horrible. There is a subplot of some damn beads that do not go and serve only to confuse things even more. In addition, nothing happens interesting for most of the film. At the time when the four leaders realized that they were in danger, I was well past the point of care. And I don't understand the reviews I've read that praise the actor of Camille Keaton. I suppose it's a great achievement if you're considering an emotional drowsiness acting. The three male leaders are the very definition of non-descriptive. They don't do anything to stand out. The support cast includes some genre favorites such as Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but no one has given anything to do. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute long monologue at the end of the film, trying to explain what happened in the previous 80 minutes. It is a weak attempt to make a cover for a very weak film.
