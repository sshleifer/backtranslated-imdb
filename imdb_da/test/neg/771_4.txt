Someone else called this movie a "fable-horror" movie, and I think it fits well. That is at least the concept. A group of teenagers, each with their own vice, gets the eyes of a twisted sideshow bark. He decides to teach the teenager a lesson by making them part of the freak show. A cool idea, but could have been done better. The fate of some of the teenagers is also obvious in your face, while other characters might have been more vicious. The end was also a serious disappointment. No resolution or big twist or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a low budget horror movie, it's pretty fun to see. If you are into cheesy spookfests, you need a laugh to look at this. I think one of its flaws, however, is ... that it takes too seriously. It's a silly movie, and if it was a little more self-conscious when it comes to that, I think it would have been better. But at least there's enough nice carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you going.
