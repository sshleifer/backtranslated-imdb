I went to the cinema to see an example of this movie without knowing anything about it. Recognizing Jennifer Lynch's name and seeing the 18 certificate, I realized that it could be disruptive. In fact, I found the movie a father. I found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it. The actor is horrible - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous pulling face. I almost do shame on the actors, even though the script gives them no chance of any credible character interaction. After some shocking events (there is plenty to "try and shock the viewer in this movie), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was exaggerated or thought it was wise, as it really was clear! The performance of the little girl character named Stephanie was the best thing about the movie. Quiet and intense. I really couldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Its violent without point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and plain stupid.
