**** SPOILER ALERT **** My girlfriend, some friends, and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We kind of knew what we came in. But the lack of plot, direction and special effects has actually left us hoping for a great (or acceptable) fighting situation between the two main characters ... the poorly reproduced swimming cobra and the super violent giant comodo (there ate people like scooping ice cream) ... we eventually get it but had to cut because of possibly budget or time constraints? The one redeeming quality is that it is ridiculously bad, with many prominent details pointed out by other readers. I recommend this movie if you are in cut onions to make you cry.
