Formerly Clint Eastwood's last tribute to the once great west. But while I thought this should be good and raise the line for future westerns to come, I was unfortunately mistaken. Unforgettable, though simple in plot, it falls flat on signs and feelings, and I will definitely say that Unforgiven is Eastwood's worst movie to date. Eastwoods itself seems too old to play a role as a play and board, which also adds a downfall to the movie's overall appearance. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem hasty and ragged around the edges, especially Eastwood's character. The play does not seem to flow and contributes to what the characters feel. The direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. So generally unforgiven is not Eastwood's best and by far one of the worst westerns around.
