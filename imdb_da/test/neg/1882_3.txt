Unlike Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolia's, I left the cinema's feeling very disappointed. I started entering the characters and their complex mother / daughter and father / daughter relationships at the beginning. I cried myself. But I had no sympathy for the signs with the end. The final act did not seem to conform to the mother's character at all. So even though the play was pretty good, I thought the movie on a whole was disappointing.
