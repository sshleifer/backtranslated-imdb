Not like I walked in expecting much from it, but at least I was hoping for a funny stupid big budget movie. This is not even that. This item is at the bottom of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me I've seen many of them). Bad play, zero characterization, little or no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that's where you can drive semi-trailers through the holes in). Sure, it has action and is tall and has more action and more noise and blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good (or even half-way) decent movie. Beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made - all I can assume is that they haven't seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.
