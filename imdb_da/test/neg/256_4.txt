On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he got his first leading role in this B-image Love Affair. The first thing you should realize is that this movie has nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of these movies. In fact, Bogey is billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heir who finds out that she has lived her extravagant lifestyle with the greeting of her late father's best friend and financial advisor Hale Hamilton. It comes as a shock to Mackaill. She sees a show business career as a way of income. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot pilot, who is also an aviation engineer, and designs an ultimate aircraft engine and looks for investors. Mackaill is willing to do that, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey. Given the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it is a little disturbing to see him as this very moral and self-righteous character in love affair. The part is not good at him. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is your average B program other feature, nothing special about it.
