This film is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the Stone Age. The effects are far too cheesy. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, why I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total time. She would probably deny all involvement. In short, there is no part of this movie worth seeing, except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent this to see the worst movie ever made, bar none.
