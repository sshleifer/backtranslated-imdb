While it has been many decades since I last read Mr. Well's "World of War" or "The Time Machine" or other of his works, I think they were all set in London or at least in England. This class "B" ("C"?) Film is set in the eastern part of the United States, like Orson Welles excellent radioadaptation 67 years ago. However, this movie shows no quality in the story style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's resistance would not be acceptable in most colleges. I was actually embarrassed by him. His rolling around in the grass on the ground crying "My family, my family" was almost ridiculous, like his reaction to the death of his brother. Of the three movie versions of the story that I have seen, this was by far the worst, with Gene Barry's 1950s version the best. In addition, it was the first time I ever saw a "machine monster" dripping sticky saliva that made the creature in "Alien".
