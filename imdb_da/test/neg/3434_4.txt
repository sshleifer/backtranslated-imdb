So I got it from the rental shop where I work before it was released (the release is 8/21), so today, and now I am speechless. They could have had a decent movie here, but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways. First of all, sharing with John Krasinski was fun, and that's the only reason I gave it over a 3, but they are broken up by bad acting and horrible "serious" reflections on the life between the protagonist (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend ( the annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better than a straight comedy ala Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> I like it because I think Krasinski is fun and wants to see him do it well. The story was not bad either, just not very original. But the director (and many of the actors) was terrible. I swear they had trouble keeping people's faces in the shot and just went with it anyway. Their carelessness is shown when the gun expert corrects another sign and says that a "Dirty Harry" gun is not one. 357 magnum but a .45 (it was like all at a .44 magnum). <br /> <br /> See this if you 1 really like John Krasinski 2- like watching low budget (and bad-directed) movie or 3- Have too much time on your hands (this is me!)
