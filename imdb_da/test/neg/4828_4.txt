I've seen this movie about thirty years ago and it's stuck in my mind so far. When I got over it on DVD, I didn't hesitate too long, even more, because I have a feel for early Belmondo flicks. But what a bad surprise! Some movies should be allowed to step back from public exposure, to preserve some memory and not to shock the audience. <br /> <br /> Broadly hailed as one of Chabrul's rare cynical works, the only lasting impression I got from the rest was ... boredom. Some movies really don't age in style. But what about movies that have no style at all? <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the script, uninspired action - presumably due to lack of direction - a kind of production design, which I do not deserve I deserve its name, less than mediocre photography, and last but not least the worst editing job I have For years, this really makes it difficult to stand. <br /> <br /> It was my impression that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment, but of course no idea or any kind of skill. It really comes as a surprise that this did not suddenly stop Chabril's career. Do not blame the overall bad taste of the 70s, this is itself shed and a worthy speaker for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.
