Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's beautiful smile and sultry look beyond the film, but unfortunately they are the only two things worth watching on this movie. When in theory we have to keep an eye on the story. <br /> <br /> The ground is thin on the ground and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she doesn't add any of the sparks she injected into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. Since the Dark Angel, it seems that Alba has been reduced to naked eyes (but what eye lights!), And is the only reason to put her in the movies. <br /> <br /> The concept of sleeping dictionary is daft and incomparable, with little character development (or sign for that matter) to make us complete 109 minutes of maturity with this world. Despite the film's short running time, it still feels too long and too unemployed. It seems a shame that such a talent as Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, Bob Hoskins is wasted on an up-and-coming narrative that scarcely increases a pulse. This movie seriously misses a trick, an exotic setting, a more than standby, with nice filmography and a chance to exploit the themes and dualistic concepts of "civilization". But there is little narrative to talk about, no drama, no sense, we see a story of love, more a story of desire and woman, happy to please men without question. Can you be honest if Jessica Alba was free to let you sleep with her do you seriously think you would be able to concentrate on learning a native language? Here lies the big problem, both in the suspension of unbelievers and also in what the female characters are limited and reduced to. Take, for example, the fact that Jessica Alba's character undergoes the mental and physical hardship of pregnancy and birth to her forbidden love, yet we see that she looks lovely and curved one minute, so lovely and curvy, with a baby, the next . br /> <br /> It is a pity to watch a movie with promises that do not meet anything near that potential. I could write endlessly about the film's mistakes, but it hurts me to do so. The movie looks good, the premise could have been made for a nice movie, but unfortunately it was not to be.
