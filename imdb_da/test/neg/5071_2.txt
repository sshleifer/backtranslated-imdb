I would like to write a little summary of this movie's plot, but ... there is simply not one! If you just look at the plot words for this title, you know pretty much the entire content of the movie: sex, tits, exploitation, female frontal nudity and woman's prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and no more. "Escape of the Island Women" (an alternative title not even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic in the prison, but it is completely lacking in brutality. WIP flicks are intended to mix graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich can certainly not compete with specialists in the field, such as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he should have kept making regular soft-core flicks. The only aspects that resemble cult cinema are the tyrant president's resemblance to Fidel Castro and the group violence of a (less?) Girl of soldiers. The girls, however, are amazing and the Ibiza movie scene looks very enchanting.
