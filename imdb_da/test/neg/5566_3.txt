The actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, are quite okay. Apart from this, there is nothing to save from this movie. Incredibly poorly behaved, stupid to tears dialogues, all-for-anticipated plot, a lot of goofs and inconsistencies (for example, a beautiful young girl gets hit in the head by a morning star, and not only does she survive but hardly scratches!) To make it short because it's not worth more, even the genre's fans can avoid it.
