Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910s, others didn't quite do it. Examples that his new job and Shanghaied are going to think about, and I also wanted The Floorwalker in this category. Charlie gets wrong for a department store manager (and vice versa). This manager is trying to steal money from the cash register and run for it, and Charlie is just an honest customer but blamed for some missing items stolen by other customers. <br /> <br /> There are not many laughs in it, except for the last few minutes or so with some amazing scenes on the escalator. Besides, quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
