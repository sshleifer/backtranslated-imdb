This is what they came up with for prop comedian Carrot Top's first feature film. A stupid surfer (carrot woman) inherits a R&D business from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things go less than swimming, but become much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt business racers. The most incredible thing about this movie is that the smart girl, Courtney Thorne-Smith, would find this red-haired step-child fascinating at least (but then he only inherited millions). 'Classic' moments include cartoon Larry Miller who drinks sweat from a plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Fun comedy? Try the UN funny toilet humor and that's exactly where it belongs - in the toilet ... rinsed twice.
