My mother and I rented this movie. I mean, we love those kind of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they're big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks. <br /> <br /> But oh we were fooled !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small Texas town. Halfway all the sudden things are all Christians on us. My mother and I believe in God and Jesus and the devil, but the way this movie preached made it annoying. All I really have to say is that we are Christians, but even we like to have fun. So don't be blamed on Christians as a whole, just blame the Christians who need to suck fun out of this movie. In fact, you can clearly understand the director's attitude to UFO's, and that's what he thinks it's all demonic. Now I could say a few words, but I will not. All I want to say is to not watch this movie unless you want to be served. In fact, it says many times that we must be perfect to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.
