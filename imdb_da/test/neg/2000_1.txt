This is my first comment on a movie here. I must say of all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead for an example, it's REALLY worth it! I promise. Don't even look at it. It's boring, bad acting, bad script and plot, bad effects the whole movie is a big piece of shit! If I could, I would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1 that is horrible, I have to vote. But I want to say that the movie is worse than horrible. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt yourself by watching this movie and hope it gets better because I can tell you already, it won't! I hoped there might be a single scene that would be worth seeing. There was no good scene at all. <br /> <br /> What an excellent piece of crap. <br /> <br /> And Coolio like a vampire? LAUGH OUT LOUD! LMAO! YARGH!
