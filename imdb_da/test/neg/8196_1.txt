One night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall movies, this monstrosity was broadcast. Though it was tempted to extinguish it, we saw it to the bitter end and hoped to see part of the redeeming value. Alas, there was none. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; editing was ridiculous. Then there was precious little to save. After a few minutes of Cameron Mitchell's doctor's character telling of some of his patients, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally horrible action, and a complete lack of coherence and continuity. The rotting cherry on this fat root was the most horrible "special effects" and "makeup" to always shine the screen, even for television. The protagonist stumbles through his role in a dimest gum mask and a pair of dishwashers that apparently have been dipped in glue and rolled into beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy movie quality tried to cover how badly the tenth power makeup was. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made during this hopelessly amateur video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-old children could have produced a better project. In the end, the bad Mr. Mitchell's back (how desperate he must have been for money!) And drones out some nonsense that would link this pile of crap with the AIDS epidemic. Please save yourself and your loved ones for inhuman cruelty by sitting through this. It was so bad that even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not have saved it.
