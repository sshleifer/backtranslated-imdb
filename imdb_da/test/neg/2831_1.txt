First of all, this is one of the worst soft-core to cable "erotic thriller" I've ever seen in my life. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want to do, it is a brothel wife and is set in a brothel. This, of course, makes the softcore-simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes, seems "in context." No matter what. <br /> <br /> Forget a moment that this was never meant to win any awards. The actors are horrible, and their line reading made me scratch. The woman who plays the female policeman is so poor that it is without description. She must be a really good friend to the guys who put the movie to this horrible adventure if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are slightly higher than porn. Other than that? I suppose if you are really full and you need something to laugh at, it would be a perfect movie. And if so, I recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the woman's policeman. What is that accent, Brooklyn? Hysterically fun!
