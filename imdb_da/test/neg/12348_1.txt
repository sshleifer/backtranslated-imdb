I was looking for a documentary with the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (by Errol Morris). Instead, I was appalled by this thorough and naive consideration of a very complex and disruptive man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This movie is called "Return of Fujimori". The director assumes that she made a "perfect" movie because it promotes both pro and anti-Fujimori factions when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> The movie has few crucial facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) She uses the so-called "landslide" election in 1995, when Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote as an example of Fujimori's massive popular support. But we all know now to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film says Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the truth commission final report says there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in Peru. 33% of them were caused by SL. It leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, the military and other groups. The fact that she uses the same misleading information that Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of how horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> For any person with some training in Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly a complete manipulator, a deceptive character and relentless egoism. His regime was far from being democratic. He is still a threat to the horses. Despite these facts, the director directs the Fujimori story. Not only on how he wants the camera to be placed, but the film's narrative and direction seems to be part of his political agenda. He always seems to have the last word. There are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and unsolicited remarks. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? The director, when questioned at the screening, did not conceal that she was deeply impressed by Fujimori's charm and intelligence. Yes, she has been completely charmed by him and you can see it by watching this movie. It is obvious that she has difficulty digesting the many facts that point to his responsibility for corruption, murder and deception that took place. She assured the thrilling audience that Fujimori really was a "patriot", as a few moments earlier, one of the leading Peruvian journalists was very sensational in telling us that Fujimori was primarily a "traitor". She continued to say that despite all the accusations, "a single dollar" was found in any bank account on his name, etc. Etc. It was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs who ruled the country for 10 years when they defended their masters. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This movie makes injustice the story. It is an insult to hundreds of dead people, disappeared or unfairly imprisoned by Fujimori's regime. No wonder she later admitted that all the Peruvian intellectuals she was friends with while the film felt betrayed by it. Impartial? The words "oportunistic", "naive" and "denial" replace me.
