I watched this movie tonight in Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as "world premiere" of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it before). I have to say I still don't really know what to do about the movie. I am not familiar with the book, bought the ticket only two hours in advance and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, when I had trouble getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes told by Jones' character, but somehow this perspective didn't fit me. And I really can't say whether some of the laugh movie was calculated or not. The cuts were sudden and disturbing, the scenes somehow merged, and the story wasn't always sensible right away (even leaving the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good, but couldn't really save the movie in any way. It was entertaining, but sometimes only in the sense that I was sitting there thinking of technical details about film making and what went wrong with this. I still don't know what kind of mood the director intended the movie to have. It was a strange mix of light, dark, supernatural. Unfortunately, it didn't penetrate me and I saw it with a technical eye. But thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie has somehow failed. I would certainly have expected something else with these involved actors ... too bad!
