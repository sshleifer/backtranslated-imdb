Having seen Darwin's nightmare, one must have the impression that Tanzania is a living hell, with its population being quasi-slaves, delivering the finest fish to the well-fed Europeans, leaving the bones of the fish to the starving population. In exchange for the fish, the Western-made weapons, which the primarily unemployed population eagerly awaits, receive because being a soldier is their only source of income. So everything is all dark with trade as incarnation of evil and source of all misery? Not quite. Fortunately, Darwin's nightmare shows only the dark sides, and completely saves the positive aspects. In fact, the documentary tells virtually nothing about the economic and ecological significance of victoriaaperch for the region. <br /> <br /> For the Victoria Lake countries, victoriaperch is the second largest source of income. The salaries in the fisheries are far above average. Tanzania has banned large trawlers to secure thousands of fishermen's jobs. The neighboring states have met with agreements to keep fishing at a sustainable level. The towns by the lake benefit from the taxes that fishermen have to pay for each kilogram of fish caught and the taxes on the factories' exports and profits. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of local traditional fish, which still plays an important role in feeding the local population. <br /> <br /> By ignoring these positive signs, the documentaries remove the much-needed Western consumers and investors and thus threaten to exacerbate the situation of Africa. <br /> <br /> For further reading I recommend two articles, the German alternative wing newspaper wrote on the subject: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
