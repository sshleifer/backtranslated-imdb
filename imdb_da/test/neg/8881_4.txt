So the other half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with Spanish question, but the film jumped forward many years with the French ruling Spain. The movie does a little to fill you in what happened and I can't remember much about it. Then the movie becomes confusing then. The movie begins when Ines, the daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of Judaism of the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. She is put on the question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth cannot buy her out of prison. Her father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession that says he is the offspring of a chimpanzee, hoping to have Ines released. All it does is give a reason to the church to condemn Lorenzo, who runs out to France. <br /> <br /> Then the movie goes on for many years and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines is released from prison. It was very good make up work to make Natalie Portman look that revived. She finds her family dead and seeks Goya for her help. She tells him she had a child in prison. Goya creates a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with French and power. He's the father. Goya sees her daughter and tells Lorenzo who decides it's best to send her to America so no one will find out. But before his plans are executed, the British go to Spain, and Spain regains power, and he is now pursued. That part is not well told in the film. It's as if the film shows that this happens in one day. FINAL VALUE: The movie is good until it jumps many years in the post-study period, and the movie expects you to understand what's going on. It was just too confusing for me then.
