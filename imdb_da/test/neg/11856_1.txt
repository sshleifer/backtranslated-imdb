So bad, it's entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me you need a beer, a drink or anything to get through this turkey. Where do they get financial support for such paint-by-the-numbers horror flicks? The fate of this film predicts which characters are being eaten and in what order, and the so-called "uniforms" of the "military" jokers are being scrapped. The riders are by no means the same raptors we met in "Jurassic Park", but a cousin. (Sorry, no spoilers here. You have to see it to find out for yourself.) Don't expect the plot to be reasonable, simple as it is, just go together for the ride. You can make it a game ... take another drink every time you hear a particular sound ... or better yet, every time someone gets crushed by a "raptor". With a little luck you will not even remember watching this "C-grade" made-for-TV movie!
