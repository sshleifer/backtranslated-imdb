This is a pretty bad movie, but well, this movie is at least not as boring as the third Ghoulies movie. Yes, it's a bad movie for writing, controlling, acting and basically everything. It has such a weak, simple and ridiculous story that also has little to do with the previous Ghoulie movie entries. It is trying to connect the movie with the first movie "Ghoulies" from 1985, but then on the other hand, if they really wanted to connect this movie to its predecessors, is there Ghoulies in this movie? Instead, we have some little people played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil dressed up as demons. Not that Ghoulies from the previous movies were any classic characters, yet they were heart and soul in the movie and also gave the movies a certain amount of fun. It's like having a Gremlins movie without Gremlins. The film is not really interesting to see because it lacks tension, good humor, exciting characters and basically everything else you can think of, because it was put together by people who, of course, are not the most talented within their business. Like the director's Jim Wynorski resumes, with films like "The Witches of Breastwick" and its successor, "Alabama Jones and Busty Crusade", "House on Hooter Hill", "Scream Queen Hot Tub Party", "The Bare Wench Project" and The sequels "The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless" and "The Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs of Mystery Mountain" and "The Da Vinci Coed" on it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is pretty stupid and campy, but it's not really enough to increase this movie and give it a little more entertainment value. You know, it's that kind of cheap watching movie with some lame-special effects, costumes, make-up and actors that no one has ever heard of ever since. <br /> <br /> It's still not the worst movie out of the series Because of the reason that "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is by far a worse movie, one had some horrible humor attempts. This movie still makes some attempts to be serious and professional, although the end result is far from perfect. <br/> <br /> Poor movie production and maybe only visible to those who have seen the previous Ghoulies entrances. <br /> <br /> 3/10
