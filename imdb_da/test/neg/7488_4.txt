Clearly, Andreas Bethmann would like to wear Jess Franco's crown while he (at least cinematically) looks at the old workhorse's wife, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt, salacious, masturbating jailer in this modern ambitious W.I.P. movie. With some exceptions, many of Franco's films are produced inappropriately and run in a crook, hurriedly. Cutters are not always cut together and the sound mixes can be terrible. As I watched "Angel of Death 2" (also called "Prison Island Massacre"), I asked myself whether Bethmann was intentionally trying to replicate Franco's patronage, or was he just naturally scary as his mentor? Is this movie deliberately bad, which would be self-covering, or is it simply bad at neglect? After a hitchhiker is forced to give a gun point blowjob, her rape fills her mouth and then fills her vagina with some drugs. Minutes later, she is drawn into a clifftop prison for reasons that are not explained and exposed to mud and rough handling of staff and other prisoners. Since this is a WIP movie, there are lesbian scenes galore and lots of violent behavior. Gore is also bloody and sadistic with delights like teeth pulling and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The action is pretty horrible, and the battle scenes are paralyzed, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash can fans enjoy. Unfortunately, the flat script makes a flat movie. So despite several atrocities, hardcore sex and a guest picture from Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But isn't that what most Jess Franco movies are?
