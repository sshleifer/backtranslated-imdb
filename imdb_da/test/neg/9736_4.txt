Despite working for the worst government in the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally regarded as historians and World War II buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant mechanic of warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and supplies he had wanted in Africa, the argument goes that things would have gone very differently. And that's certainly true. Rommel was in fact a military genius and of all accounts an upright, honest man. <br /> <br /> But this movie goes out of its way to portray him as a close weekend. He does his job and tries to win the war to Hitler, but constantly Fuhrer burns and gives him ridiculous orders, which Rommel (James Mason) expresses with amazement, but rarely actually questions and never, never abides. Only when it is obviously obvious that Hitler leads Germany to destroy, Rommel thinks he is treacherous; This dilemma plays out as the movie's main theme, a good man in bad situations trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is fine as Rommel, but it is hardly a memorable feat in keeping with George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so appropriate to make him look like a decent person, forgetting to make him interesting. He occasionally lapses in some warmth when he, along with his wife Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy, cast), but usually Mason is called upon to give a stiff British performance ?? as if the British were trying to invoke Rommel for themselves (though all Nazis have English accents except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Performed on the cheap, with no battle scenes released stock footage and beaches of Southern California doubling for Tunisia, there is nothing special to recommend this movie. A remake can be interesting (I would only choose Ed Harris because of a little physical resemblance and well Harris can act) it was seasoned a little, but this movie showed me mostly how much more demanding we as viewers have become in those Last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more.
