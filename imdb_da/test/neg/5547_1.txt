Give H.G. Lewis Point: He managed to incorporate beef exotic dancers, gallons of his infamous fake blood and Henny Youngman into a movie. "The Gore Gore Girls" was Lewis's horror movie swan song, and ending with a head being squashed by a car. Oh ... Henny plays a surly night club owner whose girls fall into Lewis standard slaughterhouse.
