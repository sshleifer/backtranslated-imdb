Reading through most of the other reviews I usually agree with most of the comments. The only thing I would add is the heterogeneous way the movie has been corrected and produced. I think some of these new wave filmmakers think they are clever by using unusual (sometimes jerked) camera angles and braiding from one scene to another. It goes well with these film festivals, and with some of these indie-type critics, but it destroys the movie for me. I have noticed in the reviews, a comment that none of these filmmakers' films have become blockbusters. This might show me my opinion, as the movie has the "rush" that makes you wonder why such a beautiful movie seems to lack a smooth flow. Regarding the comment that Kiefer Sutherland is a big name to put on the poster, I would bet he was joking when he saw the last cut. This is a story of real potential, spoiled by trying to be different in its production. Worth seeing but not many would come back to another view.
