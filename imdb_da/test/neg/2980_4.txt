Not finding the right words is everybody's problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy. They do not know what to say and they do not know how to say it, and therefore they start on the potentially humiliating business of preset speed dating. Unfortunately, they all come across as cardboard characters rather than genuine people. The story follows a traditional three-act structure: knowing the great role in their enchanted single-life, the actual dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic fallout that shows some of the newfound couple's follies. Because it is all so predictable, I would say it as a story, "The Shop" is a failure. As a comedy, it is mostly too stupid to be really fun. Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the amount of soap opera as the independent wealthy Miriam. Great makeup on her too (Verena Wei√üert): Heavy eye shadow meets skin-colored lip gloss, creating a burning and bohemian, but frugal effect. Also, Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian sweeper and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutrition expert. They bypass the communication challenge using the timeless body language of copulation.
