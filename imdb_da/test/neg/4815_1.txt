Addle-brained stupidity that the "Bullwinkle" sign has made fun for a quarter of a century in advance, shows no dead horses that you can tear a good movie (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) without copying a single string of quality from the object to your ass. The actor hardly records on the cable TV scale, the plot is less nuanced than an old "Sgt. Rock" cartoon, and only Boris J. Badanov-style "bad guy" mustache is missing from the Commies. This movie achieves the unusual experience of being too bad, too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposite thumbs.
