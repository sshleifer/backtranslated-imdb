I should have known when I heard Anne Rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. I couldn't have predicted that years after it's release, just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are amazing, and although I understand that many are lost in translation into the screen, this movie was a great big finger for its original work. One day I hope someone tries again, the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and look in both upper and lower case without good reason. They destroy Lestat's history. The queen's performance is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can't make myself laugh. The charm and feel of novels is just not there. The movie is a bad excuse to get as many musicians and "dark" pictures as possible in a movie and hope that teeny Goths of America will cut it up. Part of the appeal of the first film, of Louis' history, is that he is trapped between his humanity and his curse. Lestat must take over and show magic and excitement in the vampire world. Thank God I read the books first, or I had never touched them after this movie.
