I found it hard to worry about these characters, who were either annoying or incomplete, all living their fabulous hilarious urban life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue turned out to be love at times, and at other times the story seemed difficult to follow - was it me or were the whole scenes deleted? <br /> <br /> It felt like a bad sitcom somehow turned into a movie. The stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" might have been fun in the early 90s. As it is here, how much of the movie's humor comes from - and boy gets it fast quickly. <br /> <br /> Apart from the attractive Irish man, this movie was a dud. And not even in a "so bad is the good road". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Perhaps if you have never met any gay people or never thought of homosexuality before, then this movie may have some meaning to say. Otherwise you will still be better off hiring Boys in Band or Beautiful Thing.
