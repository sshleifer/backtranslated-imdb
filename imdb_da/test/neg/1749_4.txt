I liked most of this movie. As other reviews mentioned it has a good cast, the plot is interesting enough. All in all, it's fun to watch. But the end I feel is completely botched, it left me confused. Yes, you expect people to cross and cross each other in this kind of movie, but four times? Well, if that's justified by the plot then why not? <br /> <br /> But that's the bad part, there's absolutely no reason for it. After a certain point, it is all without significance. (here comes SPOILER). After the airport scene, ENRICO and his accomplices already have the money. I couldn't understand the need for the rest of the scams. Is it just necessary to rub Federico's nose in that he has been fooled? I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the movie and 2 out of 10 at the end.
