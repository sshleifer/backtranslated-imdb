What did they think when they made this really horrible movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did anyone have to make this film that explains her unique artistic vision as a result of an (imaginary) affair with a grotesque but charismatic hair freak (played by Downey)? In real life, Arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and the woman's role to express herself. In this film, Arbus is an ultrasound Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is attributed to a devotion to Beauty and the Beast for an interesting man. For this reinvention, the film is really shameful. Regardless of this, it is just drowsy and boring.
