I've decided to rinse this show from my memory down the toilet of the bad TV show into the turmoil of forgetful, disappointing, pointless, rubbish TV show hell. <br /> <br /> The Skyler guy who is the host / star / creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not very nice and not at all funny. In short, why is this guy on television, and especially why is he in a comedy show when he is not fun and pretends to be professional when he is definitely nothing more than an obvious pretext? Others have already said this, but this guy is totally fake and fraud. If you believe in any of these disadvantages, I think you should seriously consider getting your head checked because they are all false and those who may be true are so meaningless as spending the whole day getting someone out to give you an average meal at a restaurant? Seriously this guy needs to go away, happy that this show got canned.
