Saw this movie on a Saturday matin√©e with a friend. The theater was about 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are a lot of fun lines, it is more of a drama / excitement with humor sprinkled on top. Robin Williams gives a decent performance like Laura Linney. Become a fan of the Daily Show, Lewis Black is pretty good at this. Christopher Walken also gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly and stays that way for about the first thirty minutes so that the voltage part starts and starts to keep you on the edge of the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy film? I know that, as well as everyone else, I struggled a little with this. A character would crack a joke during the excitement sequence and you just wanted to hear one or two laughs in the theater. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, the film was left with applause. So certainly some people enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a four out of ten because I think the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a thrill / drama movie and the actors performances, while not bad, were just decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie is not what was announced.
