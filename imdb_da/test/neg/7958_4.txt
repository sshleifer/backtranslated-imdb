Deepa has again tried to boldly produce a topic that no one will talk about. The story is ok, movies are outstanding, manuscripts and plays are far below average. I suppose the blame is for the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, where her original set was destroyed in 2000. It resulted in a completely different cast, I just wonder what a spectacular movie would have been if it had the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. The current actors Lisa Ray (who is just good at squirming in Bombay Dyeing bedsheets) and John Abraham are pathetic, need basic lessons in acting. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the movie as much as possible. The child had done an excellent job. The movie's editing and flow is also not something you would have expected from Deepa. Great subject, sends a strong message of a practice that is still rather fierce in rural India but lacks the standards Deepa sets for herself on fire and earth. See it once ... when it's on DVD, don't bother paying $ 10 to see it .... yes it beats the average Hindi movie at all times
