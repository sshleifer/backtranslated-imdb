VIVA LA BAM This "Jackass" spin off focuses on Bam Margeras and his friends (of course scripted) adventures (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, while having its fair share of widespread comedy and crazy stunts, focuses primarily on Bam's torture of his parents. I'm sorry to say this, Bam, but ... you are by no means as tough as you think you are. This ego-exhibited show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic without faith. The overly stylized intro ending with Bam's cold explains that he will do "whatever f ***" he wants. What about you doing something that is actually fun? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The camera work was terrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply vile stunts they made friends. <br /> <br /> Not so with "Viva la Bam". We follow ours all around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but it never feels like anything but real lame and scripted comedy. Stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a dull and boring way that they can hardly make you smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a bad spin-off of what does a little good but feeds Margeras already for big ego. I do not recommend this lame and imaginative show to anyone.
