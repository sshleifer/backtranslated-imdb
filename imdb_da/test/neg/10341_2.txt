I participated in a screening of this film. It was done with clich√©s and very unfunny jokes and set ups. I think the other comments were of people who may have worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. I'm amazed at this movie costing $ 3-4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? Of course, this did not go to writers for rewriting. Well thought to knock on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a big miss. There was little or no spark between the protagonists, and the inciting event was, at best, staggering. The direction was uninspired and looked like a student movie. <br /> <br /> I don't even know what that means. Everyone wants to Italians. Is that a true saying. I never heard it.
