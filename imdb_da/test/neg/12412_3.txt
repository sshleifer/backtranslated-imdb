Oh, another movie with motorcycles, hell angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool driver. This movie does not depend on the story, but lots of drinking, pot and lots of moronic acts. Steve's rendering of a dying cat under his "I love what I know" serenade made me vomit for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) does with everyone! Fat did the best acting as he just laughs and produces sounds. I also dare you to try to find out what Banjo says. "You messin 'white private warehouse." These are scriptwriting people. <br /> <br /> I liked the end. What better place to have a climax than a lighthouse! You have to see this to remove it. <br /> <br /> THE JETER, THE !!!
