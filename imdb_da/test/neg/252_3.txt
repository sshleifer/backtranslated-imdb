"RVAM" s reputation ahead of it. I first heard about it in one of these co-style biobooks, "The 50 Worst Movies Ever" or "The Golden Turkey Awards" or something similar. Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to see it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally came around to show it, I expect the kind of cathartic experience that only a real film stinker can give. <br /> <br /> But "Robot" wasn't really that bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is definitely a "Z" movie through and through. Some of the vocal copying (as is the case for K. Gordon Murray's import) is horrible cheesy, and the film itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein, as much of it seems to be recording from an earlier "Aztec Mummy" "movie, told with a voice-over by the leading man. A dead giveaway: anytime the question "So what happened?" Asked more than twice in the dialog box, you look at reassembled footage along with some consideration for plot context or momentum. In RVAM, "What happened then?" or "What happened then?" Spoken at least four times in the 1st hour. <br /> <br /> Even without the structural problems, the plot and dialogue do not translate well into an older American audience. For example, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back story. He includes a note about Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who suddenly became a vicious master criminal" and began his quest for the treasure of the Aztec mummy guard. No background, no explanation, he was just "suddenly turned evil". It was clear that this was aimed at a rather discriminating audience. <br /> <br /> However, the clinician is "Robot", the supposed "show" of this movie. This robot is the worst robot-specific effect since "Undersea Kingdom" or even "Santa Claus vs. The Martians". Compared to this unwanted junk, Tin Man from the "Wizard Of Oz" saw the Terminator chassis chasing Linda Connor through the foundry in T2. Aztec Mummy itself is well designed and executed; He is recognizable undead, well-known to look like a mummy, yet separate from the "Boris Karloff" bandage collection known to most American audiences. But who designed the robot in this follow-up had no sense of the concept ... or no budget. At least they could have given him some knees for heaven's sake. <br /> <br /> In addition, the titular battle is terribly accomplished and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen shot battles on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the movie just stops. It seems to be a bit of a rip off considering how long the movie uses to build up to the actual battle. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the movie is not horrible or incompetent as a Coleman Francis movie or a Larry Buchanan movie was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of the Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is a Coppola movie. It's just kind of boring and boring and silly. The actors are competent (in a way B-movie way) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp seems to have a wonderful time especially when he learns and charts and hijacks in his coat and "Phantom Of the Opera" suit. I often found myself rooting for him, despite being the villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've seen a lot, much worse. File this with "Samson Vs The Vampire Women", under "interesting Mexican juvenile oddities".
