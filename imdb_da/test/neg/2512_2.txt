This is a rather meaningless remake. Beginning with the opening title shot of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece of chiller it was. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays a city boy photographer returning to a semi-desert desert town populated by a proliferation of underdeveloped cliché documents: the lollipop sucks Daby-Doll Lolita, the "ornery old coot prospector, the curly Veterinarian and his Asian wife etc ... <br /> <br /> Kerwin's characters testify to breaking something in a hill and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of strange blue stone are scattered around. begins to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people start acting strange, things explode, Kervin's character comes in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in a movie.The film does not develop a sense of place, no character development, no humor Everything that made Jack Arnold's original scary little Cold-War paranoia classic has been abandoned, just running through its minimal hoops and ending only. <br /> <br /> The special effects aren't special - The inside of the ship looks like bits of adhesive film wrapped around some ropes, which were then dangled in front of the camera to hit some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire work ever put on the screen. The script is repetitive - everyone says everything at least twice, Kerwin has to say "let's get out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in one scene. Lots of things are inexplicable at the end - why do foreigners need all heat and water for example? - Not that anyone would watch if the filmmakers didn't care why should we? The play is appropriate - better than the script, which at times has a subdued improvisation quality, deserves. Although the actors often seem to want to get it as soon as possible - a remarkable example of this is when Elizabeth Peña records the shortest token moment for "frustrated despair hands for face movement" before following his son Stevie outside. see him make "angry sulky teen smash something from a table" gesture. <br /> <br /> Continuity errors include the (GB) sticker on the back of Kerwin's jeep that arises and disappears, a dual action of the gas in the exploding car, a byperson is at two places at once - once in Alien Stevie's POV shot immediately afterwards in a reaction shot, Elizabeth Peña seems to close a car door twice ... you can tell I was caught, can't you? The film commits the biggest mistake. It's boring.
