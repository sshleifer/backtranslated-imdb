I would like to sit down and write an intelligent, thoughtful review, but I feel I would spend more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did. I live in Los Angeles and I'm sorry to say that the characters seemed as much as underemployed and too ego inflated ACTORS. There was not a moment in the movie as I could escape the feeling that I was watching the busy talk of free actors at a hipster LA coffee shop. One of the worst indie movies I have ever experienced with so little to recommend it to hear what won at Sundance has effectively removed any prior interest I may have had in participating, much less considering a positive Sundance review that is meaningful. Look at your own risk.
