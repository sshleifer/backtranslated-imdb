OK, I usually don't add comments to movies, but I finally watched a movie that was so full of bullsh * t and riddled with incompetence that I just had to warn people about. The Blackwater Valley Exorcist is resolved on a wife-beating / pederast / priest and this podunk family of horse freaks and to make a long story short of the youngest daughter who became molested by the priest but in love with the heavenly ranch hand is obsessed. Along with a heroic god who fights Mexican gardener who once participated in an exorcism, the wife / paternity / pastor manages to save the day, but not until the possessive demon is able to jump to a hooker to whom the city sheriff got to blow him. All in all, this movie is the biggest pile of useless (I could get much descriptive with this part, but why waste my energy on this movie) I've ever seen. Anyone and any person associated with making this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot contaminate the soil with their useless spawn.
