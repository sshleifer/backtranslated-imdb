This movie is one that belongs to the rockery floor. For one, the opening sequence does not open the element of "gang" related topic. If it was not meant to at least get the right part. Secondly ... what about all the glancing left and then right ??? they even do it in synchronous style. Nowhere have I witnessed a member of a rival crew going up to a bar, looking for someone from the outside looking like he is all that and a bag o chips on a barbie and going away without being confronted or even getting ' what for '. I wasted money on the rental price and am glad I did not buy the DVD myself. <br /> <br /> If this was done by college (T.A.F.E), then at least they gave the old Aussie trial. Better luck next time.
