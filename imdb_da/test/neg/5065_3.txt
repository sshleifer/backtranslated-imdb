The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who herself has divers to Estonia's wreck, puts this stupid "thriller" together to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Of course, Donald Sutherland is always visible - but he is only in three stages. He delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional. Also the main leader, JÃ¼rgen Prochnov, is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the molding is poor. The actor who plays the Swedish ministerial secretary (or what she was - she doesn't look at the list) is extremely poor. Scripture has some good ideas, and the story is actually interesting. The final manuscript should have been rewritten a few times yet. Some scenes are generally ridiculous - especially final scenes. <br /> <br /> The film is nearly 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. Presented as a 60 minute television movie, this could have been very interesting. As a two-hour function, it is pretentious, boring, stupid, and outright stupid. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe may be a good journalist (her ideas on governments using Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden have been finalized recently as the Swedish military officially said that actually used the ship for this) but as a film producer she sucks. <br /> <br /> The director, author, and actors suck more. /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given it a 1 if it was not for the fact that history is quite interesting at times, Donald Sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage. <br /> <br /> But we don't even see the boat sink! What kind of movie about a ship sinking is it? Like a werewolf film without a werewolf ...
