Hi, today I watched this movie because of medium (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it would be worth seeing. Also the comments here were quiet good, but after starting to watch this movie, I quickly understand that this movie is not near a 5.6! It's just boring. You can describe the movie with some words also it is just the standard horror movie story with all standard horror movie scenes. I don't know why people still like these movies or why they vote for such movies better than a 1-3 in IMDb. Just some examples <br /> <br /> Wrap people who come from somewhere or go / drive to anywhere. They meet in some way on their strange strangers, but maybe they are just good, so hang out with them. So a very important scene for every horror movie "Oh my cell phone doesn't work oh, mine too. It's so weird, but we don't need them so enjoy our trip ..." uhhhhhh our weird person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream for a while until he begins to cut parts from us or kill some of us. After a while, the victims sacrifice a weapon or a chance to escape ofcorse, they never think of running away or even killing the psychopath if they get the chance that they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with some of the handfuls of the standard tricks they got in these movies and all run back as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... oh and eventually it gets really exciting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow good movies. ... OK, if I have never seen a movie of this kind, I would say it is a movie that can be seen, but if anyone has ever seen any movie of its kind, it just has to be a boring waste of time because almost everything in the movie you know before you even looked at it, because every time it runs as a standard shadow film schematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can just drag some adjustment buttons and get the new Shuttle, Saw45674, the Jeepers Creepers kind of movie.
