The script appears to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, host cough) "borrowed" from a particular other movie involving the use of a self-propelled manned drill. The scene after scene was the two films almost the same. Just enough of serial numbers filed in this to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, I have to say that I found this entertaining as I enjoy deep underground-martial arts of movies. It's a bit on the stupid side, as far as science goes, but if you are willing to screw your eyes really hard and do so, so you don't feel the scientific gaff here and there and all the time this film is almost tolerable. Far better than "Supernova", which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in, was so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save it. A note for filmmakers: Hire a person who knows something about the subject that the film is dealing with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a great effect in general to prevent your audience from stupid on you to do stupid science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost usable. I've seen far worse in my time. <br /> <br /> A new idea of ​​disaster film: Instead of always having a happy end where the world is rescued once again, what about some where things are a little bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end in failure. Especially when the problem to be solved was caused initially by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused catastrophe with glowing, heart-warming sorts of reluctance justifies stupidity by saying, "No matter how terribly a problem is caused by killing stupidity, it can be solved." That is certainly not the case. A self-inflicted disaster film with an unhappy ending would serve as a warning of "Not so stupid stupid at first." Are you going to watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section of your local video rental store, then why not. But avoid "Supernova" as I can assure you that you are not boring. It was definitely not one of Luke Perry's better films. This one is better. It doesn't say much, but it's better. <br /> <br /> A dead head to be a deep underground genre movie. A dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the script of another particular movie of the same genre.
