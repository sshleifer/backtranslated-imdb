One of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-striped Technicolor card was that a ballet dancer shown here is called Maria Gambarelli! I half wondered if Blake Edwards named the character of Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this now forgotten performer (though the spelling of the Sommer character's surname was actually Gambrelli). I saw this on YouTube mainly to see an early Judy Garland look when we see her in profile with her two older sisters singing "La Cucaracha". It was the highlight for me, who otherwise showed some dances (like that for Mrs Gambarelli), who was fun and a little lame comedy between Andy Devine as a great bullfight (yes, right!) And Buster Keaton as a bullfighter giving one Of course, a man is in animal suits. Only fun part of these two is when they cry - with Buster giving the handkerchief for "bull" - the sad part of "La Cucaracha". Lame was also watching Ted Healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher holding failing Healy for other movie stars. (Healy himself didn't know Zeppo had left the Marx brothers when he put "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!). Speaking of a Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig, even though he has a hat to hide his bald head. It was also interesting to see Ida Lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning, although I also recognized Toby Wing from his part in Murder of Vanities last year (at least when the presenter Pete Smith identified her). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny with his clever story. Other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos, and not all are M-G-M contract players either! So with all that being said, La Fiesta de Santa Barbara is well worth a visit for all the curious about Judy Garland's early movie performance or the early use of 3-strip Technicolor.
