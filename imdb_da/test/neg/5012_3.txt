this movie is supposedly a comedy.so where did all the laughs go. Then forget to put them in, on the version I saw. As a football movie, it is mildly entertaining, I think. Maybe I'm just a stick in mud without a noticeable sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is just not fun. It's also annoying, with the way over the top "you're a winner" musical score. and the odd thing is, the team sucked through most of the season, only wins the last two games, and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the playoffs.so what is the point? are they celebrating mediocrity? I can not see it. If anyone knows, let me know. This movie is not amazing or even very good. I give it a low 3 *
