In a quiet town, there are a couple of girls witnessing the murder of one of their friends for a strange young boy named Milo, who lives across the city. After the murder, his body was found in a river and his pronounced death. So sixteen years later, a wedding girls retire to their childhood town, and Claire a schoolteacher is obsessed with Milo's death when she has recurring visions of him, and her friends die one by one, and no one believes in her when she claim Milo is separate from it. So now she goes out to find out the terrible truth. When I came across this movie, I was quite skeptical about it, especially when it had "From the Creators of Anaconda" on the front, but managed to read the odd little plot sketch on the back of the video box, it sounded good and right refreshing for a change. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a completely different story when it came to watching the movie. It just seemed to be hard to be smart and very psychologically based, but the latter element didn't look so good to me, and it was basically a long-lasting and most compelling thriller. Hi, I admit it had its moments, but hardly enough to make it either effectively chilling or memorable. But a bravo to the filmmakers, at least the story is not a rehash of the slasher imitators who followed "Scream" and shock horror, there is no self-reflecting humor obvious? In fact, there is not even a HINT of humor. Even if it was too serious? Especially since the plot is quite absurd, but it is not the biggest problem. What an unfortunate plot we get, I didn't know much about what was going on, as it seems to foam many things in favor of some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. None! More like irrelevant scenes and geese inducing cliches that we see from time to time. You can also see some influences from some "good" 70's horror movies, one of which is "Don't Look Now". This when our protagonist continues to see the figure of her past in a slicker. The other should be one of my favorites "Alice, Sweet Alice" with the person who causes the problems of wearing a yellow slicker and committing grisly death. Interesting idea, but it comes across quite low and too many errors occur. I liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood when the performances and circumstances had something horrible about it, but when it leans in their adulthood, it was tired and unintentional for the most part, and the performances were not terrible but incredibly earthly and Hardly any involvement is a good way to put it on. Most of the dialogue made me moan in disbelief as to how constructed and awkward it was. You must shout "no duh!" on the screen because you just can't believe what you hear. The police detective gets the edge of it! <br /> <br /> Quality ready - the movie is not bad, in fact it is better than your usual straight two video to say. Very smooth things. With some ingenious and prominent camera angles and a weak score that works reasonably well. Another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the insidious sound effects, and that the bicycle clock does not leave a ringing sensation in your ears. The setting of a quiet primary school was well done, and the rest of the action takes place in a house. But do not expect any real excitement or surprises, as these do not exist. The deaths are not pleasant, and they are mildly bloody, and it is more aftermath of what happens to these bodies that are trying to disturb you. The villain in this piece, the medieval child Milo Jeeder was mildly uncomfortable, good that the voice and the yellow slicker begin with an imprint, but it seems to lose its effect when we come to the conclusion of the film. The cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to (moving over) Jason (beware) Freddy and (this is not children's play) Chucky, but you must fool me! Right? He is labeled "The Evil New Face", yes certainly. All he needs is to be taught in some manners and problem-solving. Overall, the film left me with a sour taste that I could have gone without seeing it. I would certainly have done it. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much in this blur of a movie. Or even better just skip it as you won't miss much, really.
