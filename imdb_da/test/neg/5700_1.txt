It must have been a long time since I saw such a bad movie. I have to say it's really hard to make a good and / or realistic movie about air disasters, but this movie was such a waste of time and money. I also think this is an unofficial way of trying to get a bad reputation on Airbus. First, the cockpit looks very much like an Airbus cockpit, secondly you have a stick, third with computers to control beet / elevators / aileron via "fly by wire". When I watched this movie, I thought the movie's intention was "not to fly with computerized aircraft like Airbus, use Boeing instead, they have a direct connection to steering and rudder." <br /> <br /> All I can say: Poor history, horrible acting (most of the actors), worst movie trick ever ...
