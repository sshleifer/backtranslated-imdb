I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's Secretary) is one of the only good things about this movie. She is my favorite actress ever, every role she plays is always done so well. Her character is blurry, sarcastic, clever, light hearted, funny and cunning. She really does pull this role well and you get a good sense of what her character is about. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. The music is the most entertaining thing left. One of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while wearing her tight zebra striped tank top. One thing that was a little exciting about history was the idea that someone is renting these three college-aged children to spruce up an old abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and says - go on it. It would be great fun and I wish someone would give me that chance! Imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you will decide how to decorate it and straighten it up. You have total control over the entire building. It would be so much fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure, they think of it as a great task. They walk around with long faces and struggle with each other all the time. It's a bit of a bummer. But it is fun to think about the possibilities that these people are not even excited about. The film does a pretty good job so you feel helpless or a little spooked out of the theater itself. But the play (besides Woronov .. and possibly Murdoch, the boss - just because it makes a really good money hungry fake smiley businessman who never has happiness) is really awful and you end up feeling unhappy. Plus, the random slapstick is a bit sticky and kind of ruins, the reality that the film is trying to create. See it here if you dig Mary Woronov, the funky 80's Casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky overloaded theater for yourself is exciting at all.
