Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy along with clich√©-ride moralization. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked friend. Laughable special effects. Overdone is trading with bad timing. Sodom and Gamaah were destroyed before the flood? Strange terms and too many subplots, the Bible does not mention. God as a doubting father, who just has to entertain by whistling before deciding the world, must be saved from disaster. Bivideo wannabe director John Irvin adds another mistake in his worthless list of ill-directed movies, which seriously lacks plot and direction.
