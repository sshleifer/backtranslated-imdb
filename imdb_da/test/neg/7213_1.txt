this movie is a pile of waste, and to try to base it first is just a farce, the most important thing that let it go for me was the use of one line out of the first, which once said of classical actors so when Sam Elliot can not be reproduced in any way, I mean when Dalton phones are turning in 1. and he finishes the call with being cold, it was good, but when the chump calls the DEA agent home and ends the call with the stay cool do not have the same ring now really do, there are others, but I can not have trouble sending them up, but I hope you get my drive, they should have named this roadhouse wannabe ........ ..
