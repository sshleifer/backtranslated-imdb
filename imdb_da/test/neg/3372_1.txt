Jack Frost 2 was a horrible, horrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal for a great movie. The original was a low-cost comedy horror movie about a murdered, which was transformed into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. And the snowman walked around murdering people and avoiding drying dry like the plague. However, this was far from the quality of the original. It seems that this even had a lower budget, because for some reason after an hour in this movie I still hadn't seen the snowman. He gets some revenge if he is always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the sign. Disappointing for no belief, even for a bad cinema fan.
