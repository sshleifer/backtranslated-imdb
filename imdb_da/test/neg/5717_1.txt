Corny and some really bad actors, but for a Golan-Globus movie on equal footing. Saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because I liked swords and Turkish movies (what did I think?). Arnold is playing a Supreme Lord who tries to make sure an old talisman is destroyed before it blows the world. Briitte Nielsen is the title character, who at that time was Sly's girl and a pretty bad actress. Movie producers like to throw Playboy type women who can't trade in low-budget B movies. Brigitte oozes it up as Sonya and Arnold seem to be wood like Lord Kalidor. There is also Sandahl Bergman (who was in the original Conan movie as Valeria) here she plays the evil queen Gedren, an obvious camp for her Conan role. And then one of the most annoying children's actors on the screen (ernie reyes) as Prince Tarn, who should have been hit hard and sent to bed. What a bit annoying scut. Some of the swords are too bad, but the music really sucks. Special effects are cheap and look very much like the 70s as the explosion of the evil queen's castle in the climax of the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very low movie, but b movie films like it for their campiness.
