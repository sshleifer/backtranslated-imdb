Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. In fact, it's more like two or three ideas that are constantly struggling for depiction. This movie not only has its cake and eats it too; It has the whole bakery. Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he shoots the ugly camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many mistakes and oddities in the film, the injured partner is never heard from again or pointed out to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The Niro's best gag is his talk to a classroom of small children opening up the picture of how the police do not seem to be real police. It's fun when the movie progresses, his character and Murphy begin to act more and more like the cliches they seem to clash so strongly with. In a more intelligent movie, De Niros diatribe could have played as an ironic comment; Here it shows only to point out how real the movie is. While a spear on a reality-based policeman could be fun, the writing and director Tom Dey (who made far superior to Shanghai Noon a few years ago, seems to be watching the movie instead) being uncertain about foothold and instead slamming the television industry , they really let them turn off the lights (the hardest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs are they like to play table tennis at work). Russo's character has a glint of fiendish joy in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actors' enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> With a little on-screen to keep my attention, I began to wander and it's dangerous in a movie with these many plot holes. E.g; If Showtime (the name of the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are at work? For that matter, if their investigation of smugglers and the entire average guy Vargas is removed, why hasn't the hippie mentioned to him that they are on his track? Then I should not be surprised again by this villainous actions; This is the same joker who is very angry at an associate to use his new supergun without approval, threatening a deal and then sending him? By using about ten superguns to correct his entire house, of course! It's like equipping a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, Showtime gets laughing, but it's simply not enough for the movie's nearly two-hour running time. Even worse, the really wise gags suggest that this movie could really have been on something if they had only put a few drafts for the script. Murphy mugs and talks as quickly as possible with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat bored through most of this. After a completely unnecessary fist between the police and the gangsters (which remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests), Russia's character smokes "It's great TV!" Maybe it's great TV, but it's far from a fantastic movie.
