There seem to be many fans of this movie here, but I found it boring, slow, chronic and meaningless. And I see and enjoy lots of art houses and independent movies, so I didn't expect an action movie. I did not sympathize with either character. The guy from the landscape was a bad guest and did not seem to be very hard to find a job and his family in Istanbul was humorous and closed emotionally. <br /> <br /> In an interview on the DVD, the director says that the film is about a common situation in Turkey - the person going out to the country because there are no jobs and coming to Istanbul and staying with relatives during the attempt to find work. It is in itself interesting, but the film was not.
