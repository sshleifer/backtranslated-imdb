I'm not that old, I can't remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple of times. But some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells. From the moment this movie opens, you can't have sympathy or empathy for the female leadership. You also won't find anything extremely fun after hearing the opening line. Goldthwait, of course, hates so much that he must break down to feel better - even though it is his own imaginary character, he breaks down. <br /> <br /> If you ever saw Shakes the Clown, you know how unfunny Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It wasn't even fun by accident It is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits' hands become paralyzed so he can't write another script. Turn his tongue on him so he can't dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pathetic and has to make room for a new talent who dies to enter Hollywood
