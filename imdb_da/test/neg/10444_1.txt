this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they should be underwater and they literally go ashore and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big, slow computer-generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I think even worse than usual. How does this guy work? The management is the worst and there is nothing redeemable throughout the movies. I love shark movies, and this one just disappoints. I've seen these studios movies before and everything they do has a star going down and doing bad work. I'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.
