This is not a good movie. It's a tried and true remake of the English movie 'The Hitch'. But it insults the original. This is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like "David Dhawan" who is credited for managing good movies like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No. 1" ... <br / > The main theme of this movie is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes to appeal to the Indian audience, but somehow the story and the manuscript are not convincing enough. Plus it appears from the main roles, ie. Salman Khan and Govinda are pitiful. It seems they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare breasts. I do not consider this fascinating and at least any cartoon. What did the instructor think? In addition, viewers must carry the case of Govinda's Over-acting. It was simply unbearable. I ADVISE VIEWER TO SEE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK. My rating of 2 for this movie could be considered a very generous one. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would recommend the viewers to watch the English movie "Hitch" which is much better.
