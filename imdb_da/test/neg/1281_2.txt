Why did they change the sweet Rugrats TV show we all know and love in a miserable attempt to target teenagers? They don't have to. All ages see the usual rugrats. When I heard about it, I thought, "Hey. They made a TV series about the movie. Except, they really grew up as a teenager! This is getting better." When I saw it, it was as if I was watching as said of ginger unless they made it suck. Good job. <br /> <br /> When in the Rugrats series has Tommy been the director? Never. Basically, all the episodes in this trial series are about Tommy's love to lead. I don't like that. Rather, I see plots that change every episode. Not the same again and again. Also, when in the old series have each character had their own pages of history? Never. This series did it. I did not like that all separated. I don't want to see Angelica's side of the story. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like being told by ginger and rugged.
