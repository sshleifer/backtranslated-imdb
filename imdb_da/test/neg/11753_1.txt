Hitchcock's original classic greatly benefited from the performance, but also the appearance of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of reindeer cut innocence: a young teen-idol type persona. He was not an actor who had portrayed evil before this; nor was he physically suited to the role that the public might have imagined a psychopath to look, especially in the fifties, as this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (shared personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a piece of genuine Hitchcockian genius. The crowd was surprised to say the least. <br /> <br /> This is why this reprocessing does not work, even though you are trying to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you would never believe as a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily conceivable as one. He lacks Perkin's fragile appearance, and his play is clearly subordinate, at least in this role (honestly, has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as truly as Anthony Perkins?). Although it was a pointless reproduction to begin with, miscasting of history's main character sucks this movie all the way down. <br /> <br /> As a side view, I feel that Hollywood's propensity to recreate amazing movies because "young" people refuse to see something that is not in color, not only sucks high-sky of corporate greed, but is exceptionally disrespectful of the original work. As for viewers who cannot see black and white, it is their loss. Hopefully they will mature in the future and no longer require shiny colors to keep their attention. When they do, they discover that sometimes black and white work much better. With the background subdued, the story and the performances are so much more front and center. And in many cases the mood or atmosphere created by black and white filmography is just not achievable in color.
