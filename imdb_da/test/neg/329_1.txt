I've always loved horror flicks. From some of the usual well-known as "The Exorcist" to some of the more underrated as "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who speaks people, even call this garbage a b movie. It is right up at the bottom of the Z-grade. The play is the worst ever on film. Really, I've seen better on an episode of "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Looking for when the woman is going to tell them about the legend of Jack-o. She paused sometimes for a few seconds, as if someone was flashing her cue card and she was struggling to read her lines. And ROOT! <br /> <br /> Oh, and besides the bad acting, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a plastic-lit pumpkin. See Linnea Quigley in "Demons Night" or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", far superior flicks.
