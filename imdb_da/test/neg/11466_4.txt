Michael Bassett's film "Solomon Kane" (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing fantasy action adventure movie that, despite some genius scenes falling flat with its awkward pacing, has poor characterization and general dullness . Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elisabeth's army camp in Africa, where he comes face to face with the Devil's Reaper ?? a demon that gathers the devil's debts, ie. souls ?? refuses to go to hell yet, he avoids Reaper and starts a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon has left his culture of violence and bloodshed, and now includes the values ​​of peace and non-values. But when he is expelled from the monastery because of the fear of the Devil's Reaper returning, he must return to his home in Devon and along the way he turns to a traveling family of Puritans leading to the New World. On their journey through the British counties, the family is attacked, and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is abducted by the evil wizard Malachi's army, which is leading the front lines of the mysterious Masked Rider. Now a man of peace is that Solomon must return to his former life as a man of irrational violence and destruction to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite having great source material to work from and build on to create a potentially exciting and lasting medieval action adventure movie, the movie fails in three key areas. The pacing of this movie is horrible, which can have a lot to do with its incredibly short maturity of just one hour and forty minutes (and this is probably a consequence of the fact that they want to make this movie a trilogy). By constantly jumping between drama and self-characterization into action and courageous bloodshed, something kills the tension of action sequences. Instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, blaming with eagerness, expectation, the film feels incredibly subdued, and this follows on the next piece of criticism, boring. Despite being an "action-adventure" movie or in some circles, an "action epic", "Solomon Kane" is almost certainly not. The action is mundane and boring, and is generally finished before you get the chance to admire the beauty of a beheading. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there is very little characterization within this film. For example, we know a little and because of this, a little about the young woman who Soloman sets out on his journey to save. And I imagine again that the filmmaker will refer this criticism to the fact that there will probably be another movie that will hopefully touch on these aspects that this movie certainly missed. <br /> <br /> It's not a horrible movie though. James Purefoy gives a great performance like Salomon, the mercenary, to decide whether to fall back on his conscience or his knife, and how his decisions will affect not only himself but also those around him. While respecting, admiring and acknowledging must also go to Bassett and his crew to create living places that beautifully reflect the period of filming. At times, it's hard not to be carried away with the admiration of the beauty of the locations, the shooting composition and the mise-one scene on show here. It certainly shows that much time and effort has been put into this movie, but unfortunately it is not the same for the story and the characters at hand. 'Solomon Kane' certainly had the potential to be more than just an 'action epic', but it seems that the lack of a true depth of history and characters has resulted in Michael Bassett creating nothing more than one one-dimensional look at swordplay in the Middle Ages.
