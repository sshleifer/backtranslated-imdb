Right then. This movie is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other movies, has songs from other movies (Blink 182's "Mutt", Grand Theft Audio's "We Luv U"), an inordinately leading man, a ridiculous plot and paralyzed parodies of movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Redeeming Features? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough said.
