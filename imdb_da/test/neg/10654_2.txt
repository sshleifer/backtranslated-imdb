This movie is horrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a skilled teenager with the power to save the shameful Chinese. The movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot didn't do anything to show us more than a cheap sense sensibly. The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can draw from it is that it shows how arrogant a human can be. Katie must have inherited from her mother, the most annoying character I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The plot and scene were ok but the plot destroys everything, full of cheap clich√©s and hypocritical scenes, I don't expect to see this movie again in my life. Skip this one!
