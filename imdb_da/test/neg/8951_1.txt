Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the last 10 years. The writings of James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's sidekick, are almost as pathetic written by a role as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and played with almost as much conviction. <br /> <br /> On this show, people are not answering how people react to real-life things - everyone is polarized - everyone is either a very good guy or a bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minutes talk to them and then they change immediately). This is not how it works, it's not how people are. This exhibition does not take place in this reality. The plot lines are about as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just go into people's houses without getting angry and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend behind her. With Walker, everyone on the show works, including the "evil" as if he were the kind of hero that myths and adventures are made of, and the time itself bends to its whim. The lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. It is as if the scriptwriter of Wesley Crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter of Bob Sags' funniest home movies (for "humor" parts) came together and wrote all the scripts for this show. <Br /> <br /> This show is for people who believe that good always dominates evil. It is for the elderly. It is for desirable thinkers. It is for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a good ending. It is for people who want to slip away into oblivion. It is for people whose election medicine is their television. <br /> <br /> I crawl every time I see an ad for this show myself. My opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years. <br /> <br /> I used to like Chuck Norris, but this show has forever fainted him in my mind. I can't even see his older movies without thinking about this show.
