God, I hated this movie! I saw it on a snap preview 13 years ago and I still have bad flashbacks. It was without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever paid to watch. It was poorly written, badly directed, and (surprisingly considered the cast) badly acted. I'd rather be thrown out on a rooftop on razor sharp tips, and then my skin has peeled off than sitting through it again. Can you guess I didn't like it?
