I watched this movie yesterday on television. I just finished reading the book, where the movie was supposedly based. In the opening, it credited "This is a free adaptation of Eça de Queiró's novel". I should have switched off my TV at the moment. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" is making a story about the influence of the Church on people and hypocrisy in people who claim morality in the late 1800s into a story of sex. In fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was the genitals, which were only mildly mentioned in Eça de Queiró's novel. And of course the name of some characters. <br/> <br /> The characters, in the novel, were Amélia and João Eduardo victims of the church's influence. Amélia was seduced by father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. João Eduardo, her fiancé, was influenced by the priests because he dared to criticize them. In this movie, Amélia seduces anyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a drug dealer and illegal weapon. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento has turned a novel that criticized moral costumes of an era and turned it into just another movie with lots of (bad) sex. Even worse, her story was completely empty of ideas. Two waste hours! Eça de Queirós didn't really deserve it.
