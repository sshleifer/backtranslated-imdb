Quentin Tarantino's partner in crime Roger Avary (co-author of "Pulp Fiction") goes out on his own (QT goes exec. Prod. This time) to this exaggerated French thriller. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is Zed, a secure cracker extraordinaire who has driven over to France from the United States at the request of an old friend. There he stands with a modley crew member of driven hippies who, with little or no planning, think they can beat a bank vault full of gold bulbs on a French national holiday. <br /> <br /> Avary's reworking robbery has gone wrong, as Tarantino developed so well in "Reservoir Dogs", only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive alone, so Avary has plunged into a pretty beautiful distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a student coming call girl who entertains Zed upon his arrival in Paris. An amazing distraction she certainly is, but no more. I think our director wanted to add another angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately, the speed didn't help add the depth of his superficial plot so desperately needed. There was never a story in this idea that was no more than an idea. Even the surreal journey to Paris' seedy dives is uninspiring. I guess one should admit that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other over a broken jewel height, that is, until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue. "Reservoir Dogs" had it, "Killing Zoe" did not. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of the dubious Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglade's crazy portrayal of the obsessive ringleader does nothing to lift the matter. In short, Avary has tried to suppress entertainment out of nowhere. <br/> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
