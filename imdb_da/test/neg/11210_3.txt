This is a great movie for the first time ninjas dating. If you are trying to impress some cute little ninjets, I strongly recommend playing this masterpiece. It is one of the special films that allows you to miss big parts of it without disturbing the plot. I also wondered where hides a Teal ninja? Are ninjas colored coded like this? Is it normal? If I was attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas, I would die of laughter before I came to his sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was more choices, it went pretty well. I found that there were many questions about how to "sneak around" and look evil. It's about the eyebrows and attitude. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie could have been better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or the color-coded ninjas could combine in a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes, and Patricia had to avenge him 3. Various monkeys were scattered through the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced with another character 6. The French guy was also a black star ninja 7. Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as "comic" relief 8. Ninja forces came from miticlorians.
