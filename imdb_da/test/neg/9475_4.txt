Well, first of all, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is higher than Mary-Kate herself) and their boyfriends are not even French, so it is bad because they fall accents. Lamo. It's not that bad either, not their best. I'm a big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't understand me. the story is ok and it's fun to watch. It's not the kind of movie you would see again and again. But hey, when they made this movie, they were still new to it all and doing their own movie stuff. The girls also work as they are older than 13. But if you are a young viewer it is a good movie. Not so good if you are older than 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids. Then it's okay. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
