The worst ever Korean movie! The reason is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the movie does not create a single shock. It builds excitement well enough and leaves you agitated and gives no shock or jumping moment. When there is a chilling moment, you are not bothered by it, as you are still trying to figure out who is who and what is going on! It goes like this: a modeling company recruits 4 people for a modeling career. But the owners are not what they think they have model dolls of all and a strange girl is seen walking around the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and it is as much as I could understand. The end is a mud of killing, and you don't know who is a doll that is genuine and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
