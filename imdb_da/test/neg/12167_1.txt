I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I didn't finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst shit I've ever seen. What did you think to do three hours out of it? It may have a pretty good story, but actors? No. Suspense? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. It had nothing. <br /> <br /> It has this strange, crazy scientist with Einstein hair, the classic thing. Not really at all. And a man is getting younger all the time. It seems that they have just used the name Stephen King to make a crazy, too long movie with nothing exciting at all. <br /> <br /> I give this movie "1 (horrible)". If they had like -5, I'd probably take it instead. It was a total waste of time.
