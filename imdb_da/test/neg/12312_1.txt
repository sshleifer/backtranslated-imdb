When my own child asks me to leave the opening file of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to scratch my eyes. I wanted to get through the screen and release Mike Myers to sacrifice the last sharpness of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life that I have seen and immediately wanted to "unwatch" if only possible. The other films are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than this crap in the hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I'm ever witnessing this good Seus's blasphemy. <br /> <br /> To Mike Myers I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
