I enjoyed the first "Toxic Avenger", but the sequel just didn't work. There are some fun gags in the opening that involve members of the home for the blind, but past that point I was simply bored. The sequel is also filled with very quirky, low-brow humor. Only this time it is not fun! Much of the gag is about crusty Japanese stereotypes. Almost all Japanese characters appear to be minced fish. Have everyone in Japan chopped fish? The troma films are known to be more than a little irreverent, but if you want to use humor that involves racist stereotypes, at least it's fun. I can't laugh if I get the same crap I've seen a million times before! One thing I should give credit to is the free nudity. There is even more free naked than in the first. But on the whole, I was very disappointed, and the movie ends with a boring hunting scene that had me huffing and puffing, dying for the film to fade to black. At least there is a hilarious line from the movie that had me bawling with laughter. After the villain says a line from Shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) replies by saying, "F ** k you - it's from David Mamet." My score: 3 (out of 10)
