What we know about Caravaggio suggests a strong brawler with a healthy sense of right that lived among hoors and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. His works themes were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the saint within that profane. He lived at a time when homosexuality brought a death sentence and political intrigue usually involved deaths in a society defined by the maximum "strangling boy for the purity of his screams". <br /> <br /> You can't fault Derek Jarman for his filmography, nor his recreation of Caravaggio's paintings, and you certainly can't blame the man who shines away from homosexuality. But honestly, Jarman never punishes caricature over the 80s. Italian patronage is the 80s in London's art scene complete with beautiful waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy piece of Northern rough oiling his motorcycle. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of a Mills and Boons ("Why, Miss Lena without having a gypsy headscarf, you're beautiful ..."). Jarman gives Caravaggio a particularly tired motive for the murder, which left him scared. <br /> <br /> This could have been a visually stunning treat for a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent, and decadent, yet elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of Renaissance masterpieces, watched by emperors and kings. Instead, what you get is Pierre et Gilles do Italy. The beautiful boys of young boys are shown to perfection, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to satirize London's art scene, showing it low and pretentious. Using Caravaggio and the Renaissance Italy to do so is to use a silk bag to make a pig ear. In fairness, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the paintings it describes.
