Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself, but in relation to the original it cannot be stacked. Robert Stack is a terrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while fun just can't compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is fun, the only sign from the original. Most of the other characters in the film lack the original template (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except the hysterically funny lawyer Peter Blunt played by Randy Quaid. Every line says he reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office (I don't favor court cases or movements. I find out where you live and come to your house and knock down the door with ** * Baseball bat, Make a bonfire with chip indians, maybe the golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it, and then I have come up on the junior, and I take care of your brooks brothers and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight **! Do we have an understanding?). From his small role is Dan Acroyd, who is of course not a substitute for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond annoying, and all he does is not fun, it's just stupid. Overall, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison with the amazing original it cannot cut it.
