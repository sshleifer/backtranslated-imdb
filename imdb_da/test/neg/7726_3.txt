I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll movies to see if they were as bad as all that. The first thing I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most, and actually rated it a 4 out of 10. Next up was the first House of the Dead movie. Now it was terribly bad. I could look at ten minutes of it and quickly forward a little, and that was it. I could see where it went, and I didn't have to see more of it to judge it one by 10 only. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (which, however, is not of Uwe Ball, but mysteriously written by the same guys who wrote the first one so incompetently, and when it got a higher rating on IMDb than the original, I thought I would give it a try. And I actually managed to see it all. It started with some funny references and cool lines (like how the president got his orders from the Vice President!) And actresses it is bright year better than the first. Here we have cool lotachas like the ultra-modern Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coolness is in league with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Man, I hope some Matrix-style movies come together for her once. And the always lovely, super-aerobicized Victoria Pratt. I love athletic women. And there was also Nadine Velazquez (Catalina on "My name is earl") who performed quite well. <br /> <br /> The story was not much, nor was the action great, and the Ending was a disappointment as they failed in their mission. Oh well, at least the two mains survived. Guess it also a little victory. <br /> <br /> Good cast, but a pretty bad movie. The actors make it easy to see, but there is no real substance there. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
