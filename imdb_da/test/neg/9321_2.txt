Let me start by saying that I had been eager to anticipate the release of the movie for a while. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I regret to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a movie that could make last fall's "Exorcist: The Beginning" look good, but "Dominion" does just that. No wait ... it makes it look like a big movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I got myself excited about this movie and it contributed to the crash. The idea that Warner Bros. released two versions of what is essentially the same movie within six months of each other, after all, was an exciting attraction. Plus, I'm a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in the right way, he gives a good performance despite the film's often ridiculous content. On the other hand, the support molding in this film is scary. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - empty staring, delivering all her lines with the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects of this movie are at best ridiculous, and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to deprive the film's chance of being taken seriously. This movie led to more rigid giggling than anything else, and with the exception of a real chilling shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover his eyes and fringe, it also failed to offer anything in the scarecrow. I could go into detail and possibly give some spoilers away, but frankly I'm too exhausted to think about how bad this movie was to write all the things I want to say. <br /> <br /> The hunger Part of it all is that the basic idea that both versions of the film were trying to give ... a story of a pastor who has lost his faith and then regains it Having taken over his troubled past ... had great potential, especially with Skarsgard as a leading man. Unfortunately, this potential was wasted. Just watch this movie if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't expect to watch a good movie, or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours in your life. Otherwise, be satisfied with the version that was first released and continue.
