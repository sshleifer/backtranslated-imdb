I was expecting a pretty straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, raw teen comedy when I sat down to see this ... it turned out to be pretty accurate ... it was only much more sick and disgusting than I would have believed. I don't know if the director / author Gregory Poirier is ill or deeply shaken sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I might have taken it, if only it were, if all that was wrong, it required a hard stomach ... but it's not. The film is also terribly medieval and disturbing. Every single character that has more than a second of the time on the screen is an extreme ... sexual, mental or physical. I don't know if it's just the director's sense of humor, but I just found it to be ... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, there must be some seriousness. The reason is stupid. The action is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written ... all of them. There is not a single sympathetic character in the movie. The humor is disgusting and goes too far. The movie is just so incredibly poorly finished that I really don't think it's worth it for some time. If you like R-rated, raw comedies with lots of sexual induendo and graphic stuff, see The Groomsmen, or better yet, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don't look at this. I can't possibly describe you how bad it is ... you should experience it yourself. However, this is one of the times when I say you are better off speculating. That way, you can just imagine that this movie goes very close to the bottom ... without knowing it is going through it, and much lower than that. This movie looks most like a group of horny teenage guys came together, put together a movie crew member, and each one got an idea, they filmed it and put it all together. It lacks structure, texture and taste. I only recommend this for horny teen guys who have seen every other R-rated raw teen teen comedy and who doesn't care about the quality. Everyone else ... makes sense; Avoid this. It is not even worth seeing the boot. Believe me. 1.10
