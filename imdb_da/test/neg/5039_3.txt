To this day, Malcolm McLaren tells everyone that they are good at believing him that Sex Pistols was his idea and that the band members were his dolls to be used to make him money. There is a good reason why he does this, that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * The McLaren was actually directed by the band to be a leader, not vice versa. <br /> <br /> * The guns were a decent organic band and not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. The rat and Vicious also went back a long way. This is something that has led to unfair criticism of the guns over the years as they have been compared to manufactured boys' bands. <br /> <br /> * The band and no one else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created advertisements and gave interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not start the Bill Grundy event. The guns only appeared on the program because Queen had pulled out. According to the band, McLaren was on the back of arrests. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not fired. <br /> <br /> Far from persuading Sex Pistols, John Lydon (Rotten) actually sued him in the 1980s for control and a substantial amount of money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers was from McLaren's boast of 'The Great Rock & Roll Swindle'. This would indicate that McLaren is not too bright despite his influence. <br /> <br /> * Sackings and subsequent pay offs from A&M and EMI were again not constructed, only the way things went. <br /> <br /> * McLaren talks about the money he made from the band. If he had been competent, he could have done much more. It seems that he does not properly organize footage himself. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's claim at the beginning of the movie that he invented punk rock can be rejected in about ten seconds. The guns were not the first punk band, but the highest profile. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. The only parts that are worth looking at are the band's real footage, which is later used much better in 'The Filth And the Fury'.
