Has it ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few news in the "film noir" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a movie I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of these mail order video companies that offer (mostly) "dupey" looking copies of hard-to-find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The movie has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and see it. About ten minutes into this movie I began to have other thoughts. About halfway through this movie I didn't like it. When the film ended, I didn't just like what I despised. The film opens with the police questioning Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Except for being full, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a policeman and demands to be allowed to go home, the police strike him up. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the police quit and then announces Willis is clear. Willis swears he'll get revenge. Later, one of the police officers shot dead. With no other evidence that Willis is "wounding" the battle, Conroy Willis makes his only suspicion, despite his boss naming a few mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but in the absence of evidence, Willis is released. The next day, two more police are killed by a bomb. This time, Conroy goes to the bakery that Willis owns and tries to get acquainted with him. Conroy doesn't know it, but a local enjoys whose paper has been accused. Conroy's police ministry department snaps a picture of Conroy trying to smother Willis and Conroy being fired. But Conroy continues his persecution, and Willis flies to Mexico, where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (who Willis treats quite roughly) to help him prove that Willis is a killer. What this movie lacks is a compelling script. The script looks as if only a rough draft was written, and shooting began before a completed script was completed. Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur without any real reason other than the script requires it. Apart from the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass every now and then, there's nothing in the early part of the movie to make us believe he's a crazy killer cheating his wife. He treats his wife, children and employees well. Early in the film you get the impression that its Conroy is the one who is a loose cannon. He seems to randomly approve of police brutality. Conroy, no reason is convinced from the start Willis has criminal past. He seems to be operating on the motto of the old Communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something, we just haven't figured it out yet." Later, Conroy shows kindness to Al's mistress and young son, now we like him. Pardon! The early impression I got from Conroy stuck with me for too long. And he is also a stupid politician. Only after he was fired and going to Mexico, he runs a background check on Willis and discovers that a warrant has been issued for him issued in Maryland. Why didn't he think about it before? Because this movie hadn't spent enough time to run. Casting is good. Gene Barry is well considering how badly his role is in Al Willis. I'm a big fan of 40's and 50's criminal thrillers, but I didn't just think this movie was good, but left a bad taste in my mouth (a lot of modern movies do, but older movies rarely do).
