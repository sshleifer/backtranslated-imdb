I like Noel Coward, the white one. I like Noel Coward, the play writes. I like Noel Coward, the composer and the singer, but I scare the Noel Coward actress. For me it is a man who should have stayed well behind the scenes, write his plays and compose his music and make his deep and hilarious observations. He should never have been allowed in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the best outstanding talents in the 20th century, but the man just couldn't act and his voice. .with it's rolling R's and it's all too round tonal quality ... well it could easily grill cheese in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite offers from Coward, as he tirelessly shows a psychiatrist is starting an affair with a much younger woman, worse off the fact that the much younger woman is an old school friend by his much younger wife. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is so much a joy to see as ever as Coward's offended wife. It is her performance that saves this movie from immense dullness. I assume that her own little fling in Coward's Brief Encounter four years earlier qualified her for this role as she must have raised a couple of eyebrows with such a promiscuous woman and it gave her the chance to win back a few fans and get something lost sympathy. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of his productions. But the rest of the movie is dull, badly acted, predictable and at all dull to almost ass-clenching level. <br /> <br /> If you want Noel Coward, take the time to see where we are serving, Blythe Spirit or This Happy Breed instead. Three Noel Coward treasures. With lovely movies like these I suppose we can forgive him for this turkey. I have given these four stars only for the addition of Miss Johnson, but on the whole I will avoid this as a plague.
