Blood Corridors <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> London, 1840: While trying to formulate an anesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to drugs and oppressed by local bodysatchers. <br /> <br /> Riding a Gothic revival caused by the latest success of Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN COURSE (1957), Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is a weird mix of historic drama and Grand Guignol theatrics. Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff away from Hollywood - where his film career had been abandoned in a B movie route (VOODOO ICELAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for a couple of shaky shocks where good men were disturbed by circumstances without their control. In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who stumbles on a horrible secret while researching a series of murders from recent history, while in blood critics is an abusive surgeon who falls in exchange for a gang of criminal masterminds. at the East End pub rents Francis de Wolff. Less than a horror movie than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings, the film inhibits its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills (a leg cut open, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the story is mainly motivated by Karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anesthetic formula, who will relieve the patient's terrible suffering during the operation. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title 'The Doctor from Seven Dials', the finished film went out until 1962 due to the indifference of the distributors MGM, at which time co-star Christopher Lee had achieved a prominent screen credit despite to play a small - but significant role as 'Resurrection Joe', a creepy Cockney Thug who murders carefully selected patrons by Wolff's creepy pub and sells the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this glorious cameo before Frankenstein's cross beat him to international stardom, which accounts for his limited screen time, although his intense performance is one of the film's highlights. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) distinguishes himself as Wolff's partner in crime, and there is a celebration of well-known faces to support roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: DARKNESS PRINS), Betta St. John (THE DEAD OF THE DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Superb art direction (by Anthony Masters) and filmography (Geoffrey Faithful).
