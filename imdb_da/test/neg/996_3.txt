Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue advertising agency taken over by blacks. They are led by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. But he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors. It's about as original as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969, but it just seems stupid today. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. HOW is this fun?), Cruel or obvious, and the movie is full of unlikely characters. It's done in a very experimental way, making it even harder to take ... or understand. The movie just gets bizarre and surreal as it goes along. The end comes out of nothing. To make matters worse, with the only exception to Johnson, ALL appearances are bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of movies) is particularly annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (clear in bright colors) are entertaining and there is a rare good line here and there. I heard it was a cult classic, but it's more interesting than good. Skip it ... unless you're in experimental 1960's movie.
