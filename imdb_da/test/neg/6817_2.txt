PDQ Bach did better. Much of Bach's speaking part is letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment. Anna Magdalen's diary, mainly about the death of children and various other family relationships, is a more conspicuous one. The music is disturbing: 17th-century chapel orchestras and choirs, producing concert hall sound from the 20th century. The overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show. J S Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for himself. This movie adds nothing. Netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn't play so I streamed the movie. It was clear that Netflix was trying to tell me something.
