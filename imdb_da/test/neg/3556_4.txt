Ealing Comedies is their own specific subgenre in the history of the film. They were wry, droll reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always entertaining, but I feel it is misleading to characterize them as comedies. They are breezy and good-humored, rather than laugh-out-loud funny. However, the best of them are twisted with discrete satire and shot through with an occasional dark strip (especially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). I have a love for them all, but The Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one I have the biggest problem with. Compared to the others, it seems somewhat perfunctory. For me it is a sketch for a movie, but one that had to spend much more time on development before it was ready to go in front of the cameras. Everything about it is a little undercooked. For example, no real context or background is given. Henry is simply a conscientious drudge whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized while Albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by killing gift shop waste. This creates a motive for their crime, but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence of their characters or their plan. Other characters are introduced, but do not play a real role in history. The elderly resident of Hrun's guest house could (with his love of detective stories) become an ignorant thorn in his side, but used only as a background color. Similarly, the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are just there to keep the plot ticking together. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is powered exclusively by its compact plot units, which I find both frustrating and slightly annoying. The non-very brilliant robbery is achieved with minimal problems, despite Albert being prevented from performing his part in the plan (at Sidney Tafler's Clayton). The gold is then smuggled to France without accident. Everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a smaller hitch, lamely based on the French pronunciation of the letter 'R', resulting in six of the golden Eiffel Towers being accidentally sold to some English schoolgirls. <br /> This leads to a number of hectic chases when Henry and Albert attempt to retrieve them. These scenes are well done, but at each point the composers are frustrated in their pursuit of schoolgirls by a number of completely unfortunate accidents. It is as if God intentionally intervenes to give them a hard time. This kind of plot always has me painting my teeth. <br /> <br /> When they finally track the last Eiffel Tower to a Police Academy exhibit and pull it out under the nose of John Gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) all pieces of plot logic are abandoned. The final bills then just fill up the screen time until we return to the framed unit that the image started. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't even tell us about the fate of Albert's fate (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This brilliant little caper has the Ealing team's professionalism behind it, so it's far from being a bad movie. I suppose most viewers will find it much more fun than I do (and why shouldn't they?), But I don't think there was a much better movie waiting to be made, if only more time and forces had been spent on fleshing out both the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> By the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed option. <br /> <br /> PS: A curious footnote is that Audrey Hepburn is honored for her single line early, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much larger contribution. I think she just had a better agent.
