I just want to start with some quotes from other reviewers who describe it best. <br /> <br /> "This is easily one of the most overrated films this year and probably the worst movie Tarantino has ever done." "The only good thing in this movie was Mr. Waltz's performance." <br /> <br /> "So I was really disappointed and watching this movie in place # 40 of the best movies of all time is the only thing about this that leaves me with my mouth opened" Now for more details go and read "Hated it" reviews. One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats the audience like a lot of stupid people. (Front spoiler). Now I know Tarantino's style is based on imagination and fictional plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officers will be present for a movie prizes in obsessed France, and you have only two guards throughout the theater and surroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with steel pipes that lock doors and burners. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds, opening the door of our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler on point blank with about 100 rounds ... very stupid. Challenge at least our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go see Valkyrie). In addition, Mike Myer's imitation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy who makes Hitler, just picture it. What further destroyed it is the only wise and powerful sign that nailed everyone in the movie, with its psychological and emotional interrogations, ending up being deceived by the most thoughtless character in the movie. After watching the movie, I sympathized with Nazis who were portrayed for having more courage and humanity than our Basterds !!! Imagine it. <br /> <br /> My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2 hours 33 minutes wasted or you want to pause, see this movie.
