It is great that these three young directors have produced films with good production values ​​and decent plays. There is some good work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer from much of the modern gay cinema; Recycled plots, for known units (I've seen the "pool" setting too many times in gay men's movies) and hackneyed scripts. The most egregious of all is "Dorothy," whose distinguished premise is that a sweet young guy will have trouble getting laid in NYC because of the lack of identifiable gay boys in his vicinity. <br /> <br /> With regard to the cinema these shorts games like tacky little gay specials. Not much imagination in their writing or execution; Basically, they follow a point-and-shoot, shot / reaction shot / master shot convention that becomes painfully boring after five or so minutes. There is hope for queer cinema in the works Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late, big Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These movies are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values ​​are basically a gay bourgeois sensibility. That's probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
