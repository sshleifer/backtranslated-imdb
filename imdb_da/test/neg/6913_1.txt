Oh God why? I am appalled at the sheer incessancy of this delicious blathering nonsense. If all that makes sense. Well, like this movie from the bottom of the poverty line in the 1940s Hollywood, nothing in this door-pounding horror - made on three sets - very sensible ... except Dr Markoffs (Jerkoff?) Veil that shines uncontrollably for some plonky piano - The player's daughter who has big melons and a flouncy hairdresser. It's just awful ... and even has a gorilla and a big dog for meaningless, extra distractions. More Elephantine than Elephant Man, and it's just in 62 minutes! .... MONSTER MAKER is the kind of movie kids in 2005, just shouting with disbelief and wondering what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth who made them the lovable movie cooks they are today. You just have to be there. In 1944 or when in hell, this insane drive was shown to impressionable 13-year-olds in brilliant 3000-seat velvet films on a wet day. One way or another. It was made without cause by botchville crapshooter movie scammers PRC Pictures during the war years by escaping German refugees who knew who was going to make a movie when they came out of Europe when the Nazis advanced on the UFA studios ... the monster in this movie, As the mad scientist is actually a Nazi nightmare.
