Michael Caine usually appears in either very good ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without A Clue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or really bad comedies ("Noises Off", "Death Becomes Here "," Harry & Walter Go to NY "). This falls into the latter category. TA is a comedy that succeeds in only two things: coping with a cast that includes Caine, Gambon and Richardson, all of whom have comic abilities and succeed in their mission of not making the viewer laugh. There is not one really fun moment here. The main reason is the miserable script; There was so much unsuccessful attempt to write an unlimited historical story that is simply too embarrassing to follow (considering it's only a comedy) that the author (s) forgot to do the marvelous fun that, as far as I can Remember, what the whole meaning of a comedy should be. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this Moron before. Some people even say "If you're a Moron fan, you'll love this" blah blah blah. And Moron fan? Does this non-descriptive person really have fans? A comedy as poorly written as this requires a mega-talent to echo a laugh or two out of it, one like Steve Coogan and not your average Moron. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them the complete morons that they usually are. The characters of Caine and Moron are insufficiently stupid. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl. Only a truly horrible writer would think it wise to obtain a scary manuscript that is a super intelligent wise child. Smart-a ** kids are not even fun for Bill Cosby fans anymore. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a normal child and she was very funny. This stupid ol 'the-kid-ice-smarter-end-the-adults shtick belongs to a century-old Marx brothers movie.
