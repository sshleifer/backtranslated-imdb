As several posters have "suggested", this is an excuse "Star Wars" ripoff. Now, if you're going to tear off "Star Wars", at least do so; "Battlestar Galactica" did, and there were a couple of other space operations that didn't do a bad job of it, but it's certainly not one of them. David Mendenhall, the young management, is actually not too bad even though he is so overboard on the "sweet" factor. Vince Edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his "Ben Casey" days; If anything, he is even more wood than he was ten. The other performances are also nothing to write home about. Even worse are the special effects; The best thing to say about them is that they are miserable. Obviously, "foreigners" are simply actors wearing little foam or latex rubber masks, and "battle" the scenes between Edwards' raiders and aliens are poorly staged and badly shot. A very weak effort by Roger Corman. Skip it over.
