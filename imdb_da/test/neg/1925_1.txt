A nice young cast is wasted in this empty, mawkish, manipulative film that attempts to be a combination of both a sweet comedy and a welcoming drama. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem endless as characters do nothing but mop and emote. The dialogue is filled with stylish clich√©s and attempted wealth on the pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> The goal of being a moving and profound look at life and love ends the movie just being pretentious. The only real weight is the burden that the talented caste is forced to carry as well as they can. But never be afraid - they are held up by the puppet strings in the constructed plot.
