Ladies and gentlemen. Be sad (or be happy!) .. We are in the vile crime of T.V Serie-ERA !! Now count with me and anathematize our Luck: <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest "EVEN" The Cosby Mysteries "! .. Have we not already had it ?! From the end of 1990 to the end of the 2000s, we have almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner (or team) going to solve crimes by the investigation autopsy .. and what a nauseating task to do. So you will probably have many and many deterrent scenes, where we clearly, precisely and terribly see the most horrible shots in T.V's history. <br /> <br /> OH GOD .. When we had those big days; the good cop (or detective) ERA like Columbo, Kojak, Magnum and Simon & Simon. Or the good old Sci-Fi ERA, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider. And oh, we also have the lovely and sexy ones: Cover up, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop like Thunder in Paradise. All of them were unforgettable, original, good. . Real good thoughts, actions, women. To X FILES came. And then it was the beginning of the accident or to be precise: The disaster! X Files was undoubtedly one of the biggest, but there were a few drawbacks we had, Agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) had at each episode making an autopsy ... and of course, her lap (like the series succeed) become part of our living room so that the producers thirst for money loved it with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth. Therefore, they tried to repeat it in another, not too long classification: The Forensic! But it became so ugly, full of deformation and very cruddy like BONES. Plus unsexy present by Emily Deschanel, and bleeder like David Boreanaz (he was much better in the angel) and all those bodies. To the extent that every time I saw it, I found my self-defeating AAAAHHHHHH !! What a horrible brutal !! .. <br /> <br /> Please disconnect .. You have canceled before real good shows like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here it is a bad .. So thank you .. Little Mercy and enough with Bones-ERA !!! .. Or we will lose ourselves of Nausea and Monotony !!
