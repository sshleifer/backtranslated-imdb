What irritates me with so-called science programs like these is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live millions of years ago. First, no one can even do a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions / billion years old. It is a low theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with large assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot. Second, no one can prove that evolution has ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still MISSING! If you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth, they are complete animals of a particular species, e.g. A dog or cat. No one has ever found the skeleton of a dog that turns into a cat or in the example presented in this series, a dinosaur becomes a bird. <br /> <br /> This is totally hogwash. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal that changes into another kind of animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything in it were created. <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious world view hiding under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you see here is SCIENCE FICTION. <br /> <br /> To see a science fiction program that has a decency to admit that it is a science fiction program, look rather Star Trek or Star Wars.
