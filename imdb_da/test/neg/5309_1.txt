I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this case I have to weigh in. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, sharp dialogue, refreshing plot phrases. Movies based on his books go back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majesty (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez) among others. Even when done so, the films have at least some degree of history's essence coming through. This, .... it's simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. The action is bad (I don't know why, because these are very good people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, chemistry is lacking, the actors and actors are misguided. When Elmore Leonard is a great storyteller, I hope that anyone who does not know his work would be discouraged from reading his books because they saw this disappointing reproduction of one of his stories. The story is a successor to Get Shorty. If you haven't seen that movie, don't see this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. <br /> <br /> I looked cold a couple of years back, and tonight you've visited knowledge again. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how gloomy this successor was. Fortunately, I do not think less of those who appeared in this movie because they had done so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and fun. Travolta I almost always like, but he is so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the previous Get Shorty. He was obviously unable to enjoy what happened here. <br /> <br /> And I hear Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, is in pre-production for the 2008 release. Hopefully they can pull it off. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all good.
