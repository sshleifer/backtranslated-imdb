From what I understand, Mr. Bava this project before completion ... AND HAPPY THAT !!! If I were him, I would surely have made every copy burn, and if somebody in the future ever asked me about this movie ... IT'S NEVER HAPPINESS & IT'S ANY PROPERTY ... the end of the story . <br /> <br /> Despite some nice sets and good photography, this is a horrible movie ... should it be scary? (not least) should it be fun ?? (puh-leese) A total waste of time ... and I really don't like to say it !!
