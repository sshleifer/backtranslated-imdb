I bought this movie from a market stall three years ago .. I'll give it to you when I sat down and watch it .. I thought 'OK! This will be another great act B-movie. "Of course I was wrong. While I watched this movie, I began to realize that this movie took me to another planet .. full of cr * p! <br /> <br /> I started to get bored and Tired of this movie, although I wanted to see it happen in the end .. I really felt it really came to my nerves. <br /> <br /> The people behind the movie may have brought some well-known name actors into this project .. But what were they thinking? Even these actors couldn't save this movie. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie ... I felt this was a waste of money ... just buying this little life sucks movies for a small amount of money. A few months later I sent the tape to charity .. I didn't want to see it again .. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you are thinking of watching a movie then nodding I can highly recommend it to you .. Me? I'd rather go to Pro Plus and see something decent ..! <br /> <br /> Disappointing 1 in 10!
