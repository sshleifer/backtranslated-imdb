What the hell is this movie about? Well, if I didn't know that "the son of the mask" is categorized as comedy, I would never have a clue! And comedy? A tragedy, it is the right genre for this yet another-so-called successor. Yes I have seen "Dumb and Dumber" but I never thought anyone would ever make the title right in Hollywood. Yes, you see "The Mask's Son" and you think .. 5 minutes - Dumb ... 10 minutes - Dumber ... 15 minutes Dumeste ... And then after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say: / I am from here ... Sorry, my nominees for the Comedy Crap of the Year 2005.
