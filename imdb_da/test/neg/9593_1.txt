Laughed my ass off, but probably because I was stoned. That aside ... this is by no means a horror movie, there is no horror at all throughout this movie and the plot holes are so large that even a below average IQ person would think it was stupid. In addition, I live in Denmark and have been throughout my life and can assure you that Denmark is far too small a country where you need GPSs and maps to find your way back if you lost. I would estimate that unless you really made an effort in it, you could never be farther away from the city or more than a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I don't think any part of the film, except for two shots from Copenhagen, where none of the players were in, was actually lost in Denmark. Mossy woman does not speak Swedish. The helmet of the first moss house is brand new. The girl they find in the forest hides under a kind of stone that is not found in Denmark. This is just stupid.
