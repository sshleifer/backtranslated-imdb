After a 19th century gun dual that goes wrong, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her goth, tempting persona to maintain her talents as a cold-blooded killer. This is a low class B feature that should have gone straight to the video. Violence is evil and shudder, but actually quite mild. The story is so weak, and the dialogue is so random that it is hard to work much interest. Eileen Daly is the protagonist Lilith Silver. Also in the casting are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
