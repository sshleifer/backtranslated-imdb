Rented (free rental thank goodness) this as supposedly filmed in CT where I live .... could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matters! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt at a low budget, which can be good if done right. In a nutshell about a bunch of young adults witnessing meteor wreck and subsequently falling in front of foreigners on a lighthouse, assisted by goalkeeper and wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - Acting = Terrible <br /> <br /> - Writing = Uninspired <br /> <br /> - Story = done a million times before with different settings <br /> < br /> - production values ​​= okay (lighting) for budget <br /> <br /> - effects (creation, digital, others) EXCELLENT, VERY CHEAP VIEW <br /> <br /> So you get the core of it. To add insult to injury, than credits have circles of movies - really now ...... who cares! Distributed under a Universal company, shocked, they would even do so after viewing. Finally, as an alternative, try "CREEP". Low budget, but well written, well acted, and right, good, scary!
