This movie was horrible. I thought it would be OK, but it just got worse and worse. From the start scene it seems to be heading for another safe predictable rom-com, but the moment he gets to the house, it just goes up. None of the characters have any depth, and the only person who was anywhere near credible was Tom, although the way he became so easily distracted just irritated me after a while. The dialogue is ridiculous and the film's structure is almost completely non-existent. In an insulting attempt at comedy, the author / instructor introduces a new character or event into virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, making it very confusing to keep track of what's going on. The reason is hardly an excuse for a movie: guy likes girl, house sets fathers home to get to know girl, destroys house, becomes girl. A complete waste of time.
