This is definitely the worst comedy I've ever seen. However, it is difficult to explain because (unless you have seen this), I know you have never seen a good or bad comedy; it's just there (it's the original part - not good or bad, just there)! <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have seen every comedian acting as a lead, and like all of them. It makes it such a mystery. The support bands actually work (although the dialogue is poor). The only sign that is pretty good is what is played by John Goodman. He does a great job with the little dialogue he has, and actually has a fun line (I don't wanna spoil the only fun line in the movie if you decide to watch anyway. It involves a pancake.) The great mysteries are the most important leaders. I will not call them signs because no signs have been developed. This script is so young that they don't even bother giving the leading fictitious names. They all use their own. They don't even seem to try to act. It's as if they all read aloud from scripts that the local junior high sent to them. I actually wrote a paper like this to my English class when I was thirteen, it wasn't fun either. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, just don't rent this. It is not fun. It doesn't even have the kind of bad dialogue you can moan for. I just sat staring through it all. It was so boring that I couldn't even feel annoyance at how bad it was. I can't imagine how this even gets a rating of 4 here.
