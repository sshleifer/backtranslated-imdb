Maybe James P. Lay knows what to do in the audio department if a director monitors him. <br /> <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)', however, he cannot obtain anything as an author or as a director. <Br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this movie, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no words, no action that deserves that name. <br /> <br /> In any of these departments, this movie is trillions of light years behind any short film that has some real thinking in it, even one minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works! <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it could be used as a mental torture or as a negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Recommend it only to your worst enemies!
