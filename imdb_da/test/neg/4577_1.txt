I had in vain to catch this on an aircraft recently. I had the bigger accident of playing on my RETURN flight too. Of course, Demi is trying to get some "arty" cred, the movie is a shambles because of its miserable acting ability. A better actress could have done this work, but a simple look at Moore's face shows the emptiness inside. At least she didn't destroy the American literature this time.
