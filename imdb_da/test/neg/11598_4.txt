Komodo vs Cobra will not set the world on fire. It is not a hallmark of cinema history. What it is is a group of under-funded filmmakers trying to make another movie, making another paycheck, and continuing to support themselves and their families. As such, I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it must be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not many big budget films are made there. BUT-- they're a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into the creepy American monster girl needs affordable SFX. And I get a kick out to look for the same places over and over in these flicks. If for some reason you see yourself watching it again, look at the sequence where Pare and company go through a "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you happen to still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the people in there trampling through the same ersatz jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. I can admire the thrift of these movies. Every dollar really shows up on the screen! Too bad there just isn't enough dollars ......
