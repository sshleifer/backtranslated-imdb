I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the film itself, based solely on the chance that it is one of the rare, overlooked gems one can discover from time to time and really enjoy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not one of those films. I'm not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse, deliberate agenda, but some elements in it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. It is a good prerequisite and it could have made a gripping story, but the execution just made me switch between being annoyed and amused at the ridicule of it. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the United States on job search and who are used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, violent devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore fun. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of immigrants is also a worthy example of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as an ointment to boo-boos and ouies worldwide. I couldn't help laughing when I saw these "field workers" probably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hairpieces from a top notch salon. A little restraint and a more impartial hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie that evokes some intended emotions over sarcastic snickers.
