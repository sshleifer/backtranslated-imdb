Having eaten "Human Pork Chop" and digested it properly, I felt encouraged and obliged to inform potential viewers that chewing on this product is NO FUNCTION and its low nutrient substance. According to the tedious nature of this movie, the following will be a warning more than an overview. This is the first time I wanted an "I-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie" button on IMDB because the only response to this boring piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference. Any possible assessment would do injustice to all the other things listed here, a "10" doubt anyway, "1" may persuade some readers that this is one of those cases where "it's so bad that it's actually really bad and it's kewl! "and" 5 "is also unsatisfactory, people might think it's an ok-flick and okay if you want some cheesy fun as it's not ... Honest against God, it is neither a "10", a zero or a 5, it is not something, a black hole, a fruitful work that is the concept of a man. I bought the 3 DVD region which was cheap (7 bucks !!!) at least and of good picture quality, I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted under my own post. Oh, I should be disappointed. This movie is neither shocking nor obnoxious nor unpleasant either ... it is not even ridiculous, it does not take too seriously to laugh, but still serious enough not to be a cartoon. A really scary, amateurish effort. The only order I found MILDLY DISTURBING is when two giggling thugs put a nasty dog ​​in a bag and bash it against a brick ... but even such a cruel premise only leads to a poor performance. The further downed TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and filmed with no sense of tension, suffering or humiliation - the stools look like painted bog-mellows !!! There is a slaughterhouse scene at the end of a loooong 85 minutes, where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup that one also finds depicted on the front of the DVD) begins to dispose of the woman's body. Reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now these flicks are worth seeing and true masterpieces. Let's be REALISTIC for once and don't rush to make a myth out of any Asian wannabe scary movies that seems to happen lately ... If you're looking for some eastern horror, try Danny Lee's masterpiece with it The same (English) title "Ba Xian fan dian zhi pure rou cha shao bao" (Human Pork Chop) dates from 1992 and has - without reason I could add - been compared to "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer". There is also a similar film that tells the same story of another movie crew member called "Ren tou doufu shang" (same day as a secret in my soup), a kind of rival production. It is available as a region 3 DVD and is considered to be better than "Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". I can add a few words to the special effects ... what special effects?!? There are a couple of limbs, they look awful - in the wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". <Br /> <br /> It's all about the information I can share on this topic, hopefully it will prove useful ... Enjoy your meal!
