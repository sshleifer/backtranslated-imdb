I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned in my chair. It's so bad that it just couldn't have been worse. Not even did I laugh at the sadly tried jokes in this movie. I have seen and enjoyed numerous parodies of great movies, but unfortunately it will always be the one I remember best - in my nightmares. The only reason anyone would like to see this is if they want it to enter a coma for a short period of time. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever.
