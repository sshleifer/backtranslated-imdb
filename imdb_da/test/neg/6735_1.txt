If I could have given this movie 0/10 I would, and that is the first movie I wanted to judge so low. Its worse than terrible. If I went to see it in the cinema I would like to have the cinema pay ME to see it (at least the minimum wage). Some of the camera's shots were quite effective, but much was nonsense, for example. scold reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders sideways from his body (see is believing). Several totally meaningless kills of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh loudly because of the victim's actions / facial expressions when they were shot. I only saw it to the end (fast 10 minute transmission of the boring meaningless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal in a decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none (should have known he in The beginning threw someone while walking down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - the end of the 'action' scene. In a scene, we see the Seagal hand-carved throne's neck in slow motion, making it clear that his hand has never been contacted. The top villain continues to come back to life. He is shot in the chest in two separate apartments. The first time it is with a shotgun blowing him out on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the street. In summary, this movie is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks very low budget (even for Seagal). The color is dull and gray. I could go on and on .... like this movie, but I don't want to. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. It is guaranteed to put you to bed.
