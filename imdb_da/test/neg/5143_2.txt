The movie plot seems to have been built up of an irreconcilable dream. There is not enough realism to keep the viewer's interest. The Vermont Farm scene was an erroneous opportunity to show how farms were created and farm families lived that would have been interesting and entertaining. There was little if no study of the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period. The costumes from the Canadians looked like something from the French Revolution, absolutely incredible. The fiddle game was good and of the time period, but Chris's movements while apparently played were incredible. The appearance of the wool was a never-explained mystery, and the train disappeared in thin air was too much. I couldn't understand how a living trout was frozen in the ice and why two men in the desert without food would release the trout, a good source of food.
