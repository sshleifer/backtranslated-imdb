Generally speaking, political messages are made on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental proof, keep an eye on the content of your hearts. Most people go to the cinema to be entertained, not sold some poppycock political jokes. The hook here is the big name that is cast. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances corresponds to a whole movie that went completely nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal screen time. In short, "Silver City" should be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non-documentary, migratory political exposure to illegal immigration, pollution and a number of other causes that do not belong, except on the small screen. - NOTE
