I clicked on the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see, the island of Dr. Moreau. I only caught a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man ran to meet Charlie and grabbed him by the arm. Suddenly, an Assassin in a light rain jacket drains the old man in the head (with a side arm) across the street. After waiting for "C" to turn around and see, "A" tries to shoot "C" and is missing clear. "C" was a much easier target, the old one couldn't have gone far. You h! There is a hunt and "C" is on an elevator "A" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable, which is parallel to "A". He hits and removes the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, "A" lines up to "C" from maybe 50 meters, but it's silly to see that a motorcycle comes up and breaks the rider instead. How does Charlie get his share? Goes to the producers and says "Look, my child needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid Sit-Com. All the actors are good except, yup ... you got it. I usually have to leave 2 or 3 minutes of waiting for C.S.I. to move on. Let's see what can I do for the next hour. I know I will trim my toenails! Much better use of my time.
