Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, like most reviewers, I've been consistently disappointed with the adaptations to movies from his printed works. A few notable exceptions are "Stand By Me" from "The Body", "Carrie" from the short story short story, and "The Shawshank Redemption" from "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This movie is by far the worst ever produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is not surprising that Mr. King has largely denied any connection with it. I feel the thing that most offended me about this badly acted, inexpensive, secretive piece of waste is that they had arrogance to completely change the end. Don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow-wow of a movie! !
