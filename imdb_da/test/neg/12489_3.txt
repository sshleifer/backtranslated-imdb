At the start of the film, Ramgopal Verma says "Sarkar" is his tribute to The Godfather. This feels more like an insult. It pales terribly in relation to the Coppola classic. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film created a lot of expectations and buzz. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character that automatically draws instant comparisons with Indian political party Shiv Senas Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who returns from abroad and gets caught in Sarkar's policy at home. Like Al Pacino in the original Godfather. <br /> <br /> Like most Bollywood fares, events and signs are obviously simplified and without any solid foundation. Fast phone calls and sudden messages turn the movie from one direction to another. Abishek goes to Mumbai's dark underground politics crime nusus that a duck takes to water. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar should look magnificent and powerful, he just ends up looking old and clueless. Most of his plays are centered around and constantly staring at various things around the movie - the actor in front of him, the floor or in another random direction. <br /> <br /> However, Kay Kay performs very well as the rejected older son Vishnu. It also makes Zakir Hussain like Rashid, the Dubai-based dope smuggler who wants to get his foot in Mumbai. This actor has a great screen presence and can send shivers into your spine with the way he looks. The moment he enters the screen, you will run and store under the bed. <br /> <br /> All their obvious mistakes were not contradictory, and the movie did well at the box office. Buzz and the big star cast of course helps. Verma also manages to keep your interest albeit mild against the last half of the film. He actually makes a sequel to this, which I am sure will be more of the same fare.
