OK - I gave it a "3" just because of course they had no money to make this movie, but I feel it might deserve the "2.3" rating it had when I came here. I actually help raise that rating despite being bored for the last one and a half hours. I want to save the "1s" and "2s" for the higher budget crap. At least, the decision-makers of the "Youth's Revolt" did not make much money. They managed to waste 90 minutes in my life. <br /> <br /> The movie is too claustrophobic for me. The whole movie takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and hallways. With an attitude like this, there should have been more action or character development, but there is just a lot of pointless speech. I didn't get to know any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a Goth chick, but we never find much more about them. None of the characters seem really sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie made at zero budget. No scary special effects. No excitement. Really nothing interesting at all here, folks. I admit that I downloaded this from the web. It was free, but I throw it away. <br /> <br /> Excuse the filmmakers. Better luck next time. This is more like a soap opera than a zombie film.
