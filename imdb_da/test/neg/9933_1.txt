First of all, even IMDb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is very "gappy". Even main characters lack it as Buddy for example. <br /> <br /> Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this tortured me for 82 or in many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much is because I was very excited to see it in advance. <br /> <br /> The plot line itself is good. It could have been a good movie if it was done correctly and with careful casting. Golden Brooks was a big disappointment. I now see that the only role she can be good at is the tall, fun-loving, energetic sexy chick she plays on Girlfriends. Melodramatic roles are not for her at all. She thoroughly killed her character, Rachel. I love some of the casting that Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they couldn't save this catastrophic movie. Of course, it's only my personal opinion that I can't stand Hill Harper as a man, nor did he help me like him here either. <br /> <br /> Golden Brook's voice disturbed me so much that I actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie. It seemed as if she whispered throughout the collection. The director, I don't even want to waste the board space, he did such a bad job. The editing, photography / camera focus and almost everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Quite unreal and many times just hilarious (as it had to make you cry and search deep within yourself). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was seriously messed up. I would NOT recommend it to anyone unless they are filmographic and want to see an example of their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a good day, all !!!
