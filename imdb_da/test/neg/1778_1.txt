Initially, the look of a control panel that reads "8 miles of the cost of California" and no, I did not see it, they really did not understand the cost rather than off the coast. These people must have been morons. It's good if you're into horrible movies, but the sheer fact that they couldn't get a simple spelling problem makes me believe they really didn't do anything for creating the movie at all. The Navy uniforms are not correct at all in any way. <br /> <br /> Wow, quite ridiculous, but good if you're looking for something insane stupid to see. How these people have made some money out of this is beyond me.
