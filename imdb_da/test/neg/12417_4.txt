The "Wild Rebels" was probably a fun second movie on a movie triple feature drive 40 years ago. It has not age very well, but it was never meant to be old it was of course meant to be one-time use, forgettable fun from the start. Taken at that level, it is a good example of the biker flick genre. <br /> <br /> Several items help distinguish it from the dozens of similar movies being knocked out at the same time. "Helden", "Rod Tillman" (Steve Alaimo) comes as something of an unimpressive 'Everyman' - he is not very brave, hard, talented or handsome (though he wins a battle with a hard biker member halfway into the movie, and the girlfriend member chooses to help him over his fellow player at the end of the movie). The soundtrack is quite well finished with a nice 'Ventures' style bass / drum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit. And even though the manuscript is pretty low, all the actors retain their cardboard characters convincingly and with a lot of energy. There are lots of careless technical gaffes: horrible 'day to night scenes' occur in broad daylight, screaming tires in a swamp, fire sirens mistakenly attached to the soundtrack instead of police sirens, a banknote made of duct tape on a ceiling tile, a luger That sounds like a Winchester 30-06, shotgun blasts that cut down people 100 yards away, a detective kills a biker on a 3rd floor landing off the ground with a 2 inch barrel revolver. <br /> <br /> There are a whole lot of greasy story elements: Linda (the girl gang member) disables a bank guard with a drug-filled syringe, the final shooting takes place inside a lighthouse (!), police roadblocks do not actually block roads, police has apparently never heard of ducking, and police detectives have apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their undercover guy wea ring a lead. <br /> <br /> But the plot chugs along, the cameraman knows what he's doing, pacing in most scenes is pretty good, and there are some fine, zippy one liners and dialogue exchanges here and there that keep the energy level up. (My favorite: "Man you divulge with private stock!" (Ie Linda) "No, don't look this out or anything, but if a copy of the MST version should fall into your hands, you should have some good ones, Low fun to watch, much superior to "Five the Hard Way" or "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three other MST covered counter culture films).
