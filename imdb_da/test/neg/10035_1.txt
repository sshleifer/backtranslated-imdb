If someone tells you that this picture is just amazing, they probably have something to do with either doing it or taking advantage of it. This movie is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It is a low budget film with amateur players. It looks like it was filmed for a movie competition. The action is horrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw scriptwriter. My family laughed at it. One class ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You will not be afraid of this. Here is a little taste of the terrible elements of this movie. When the guy gets his toe stomped by Ric White's silly depiction of the reverend James Johnston walking cane. The boys' reactions are as if he had an amputation without painkillers. Watch the DVD extra files after watching the movie. When you see Ric White and others talk so seriously about the movie, you will laugh until your stomach hurts. How people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck. Don't be fooled as we did and buy this mistake.
