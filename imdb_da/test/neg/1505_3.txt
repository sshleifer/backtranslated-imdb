OK the end of the story is - all the killings were a joke on the protagonist, and no one is actually dead. Yes I know Cry Wolf did it and did well, but it's not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Although the "signs" do not seem to die, we see them being stabbed to death (and other ways they are killed), even though these "kill" DO NOT take place as anyone can see them. Sir. Director, if you want to show people being killed, someone should see it if they are off the camera and the sign is falsely killed, it alone, it does not work - and finally I liked a few scenes but your end destroyed all. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible (especially the child at the beginning, who really thinks he tricked his friends into thinking they were playing with their dead grandmother's brains) The script is less than half baked (though you is half baked you like the movie) the only reason i gave this movie a 3 is because a) they actually did something b) they got it released and c) they shot at movie Yes you read right, they wasted (in it at least $ 5,000 on film stock for this crap. Sadly, if they had shot DV, they'd got some money for a better cast and another author to go through the script and do it well. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director did something (like most don't) but HATWE the fact that he comes on IMDFB and talks about how the "original" movie is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see if a friend has it It can be a fun movie to borrow.
