... And it's a not very good documentary, whether American MOVIE seems to have confused some people to believe it is a spoof documentary ("Mockumentary") and even some newspaper television lists described it as such. I don't want to laugh out loud because it is easy to fault this documentary as a big wind up, it's a spider. <br /> <br /> What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary is centered on budding film producer Mark Borchardt, who is .... How can I say that? What's more, it's even confused? Yes, but it is not necessarily a bad thing, because if we had no dreams, we would all still live in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies must not be taken as a criticism since both Sam Raimi (yes the one ) and Peter Jackson (yes the one) both started making low budget horror comedies so again it is not a criticism. No, it's just that Mark Borchardt (yes the one) is a parody of American trailer waste <br /> <br /> Remember there is something about MA RY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a risky hitch hiker ("Come In in my office because you are f *** in the 'lighthouse') Well, what Mark looks like with most Jerry Springer guests, so it's very easy to see why some people thought this was not a It is not a very good documentary, as Mark and co give me a crawl. Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow up to be a serial killer? Does anyone else think that there is plenty of time to this happens?
