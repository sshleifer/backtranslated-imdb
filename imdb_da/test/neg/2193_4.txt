Now I've seen two movies by director Chen Kaige, a very good (Goodbye to my concubine), and this bad, The Assassin. Both films depict important events in Chinese history, FMC in the 20th century and TA the first association of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC succeds with memorable characters, beautiful filmography, compelling sets, good acting and an interesting story. Assassin fails at almost every level (okay, the sets are good, cinema is good, and the few fighting scenes are quite exciting). But ... the pathos. Call me a cynic, but too much is too much. If you felt that Saving Private Ryan was too pathetic, be aware this will make you sick. The dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem like political statements, subtle or entertaining, this picture is not. The film is overcome by its own pompiness. I'm really surprised that Assassin gets so high votes here on imdb. 4.10
