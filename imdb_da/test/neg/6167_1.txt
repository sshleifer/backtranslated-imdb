Most predictable movies I've ever seen ... very boring, I want to have seen a hundred movies with the same story as this one. It is at best in order, there are no actions really, and there is absolutely no excitement. Powerful actors with terrible scripts think I could have written better by a 10th degree. Felt like more of a task to look at, because I was hoping there would be something in this movie that should separate it, but it fits right into the pile. The whole movie I was waiting for good to do, but it never came. I never rate movies and I never go through movies, but this movie was so bad I had to log in here and write a review to try to save a few poor souls from wasting their time (and / or money) with this movie. I pirated it and wished I had never wasted space on the hard drive. If I used 10 bucks to watch this in theaters I would kill myself.
