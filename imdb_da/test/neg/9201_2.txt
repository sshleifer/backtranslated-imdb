I say, Ben Johnson and my fellow candidates say, "Ben Johnson?!" - he was a good lady MOVIE STAR guys, a COWBOY, and in 1976 he scraped by playing a sheriff in stupid made for television disaster film like this and deposited on DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES, which everyone apparently thought to come to get us at the time. So there are these bees and they kill some people by flying in their mouths and going after them underwater. Finally, these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the whole swarm. The police are like, what do we do? Uh, bees die when it's cold. So where could we make it cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! So they drive this car and its accompanying swarm of killers over and over through the streets of New Orleans, with a bullhorn saying "GET THE STRATEGIES OR BE STUN TO DEATH." And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its ruined toilets then becomes the narcotic judgment of these particular bunchabies. I don't know what greater indignation in this great city is ... I do, but it's also bad. Most conveniently seen on an extremely faded-to-orange 16mm print, though Betamax is a good alternative!
