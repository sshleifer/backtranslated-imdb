So much for JUDGE AND JURY, who lives up to his nonsense title. What good is there? The lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie you ask? Well, that is quite clear. In fact, David Keith does quite well for disguise of clowns, chefs and other shenanigans while he is the killer who escaped the death row. But in spite of some new changes, it is extremely stupid. Unapix has recently spoken some ridiculous productions, and one only means so much. We the jury finds this film guilty of its indecent exposure to many of us who sit and believe that it is a total waste of our time!
