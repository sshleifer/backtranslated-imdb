I don't know what was worse, the viewer made doping of, or the stars of this movie, similar to dopes. Should I believe that this woman traveled this child for seven years and never noticed that the baby was a little dark? Do I have to believe in her mother, her father and her husband never even said, hmmm this kid looks a little dark? Should I believe when the courts ordered the mother to see the adopted parents' records that Lisa Hartman had this wow look at her face when she told her mother, Christopher is half black! What ! Was it right, you think so. So not only Grandma and Grandpa were drowsy and stupid never even mentioned this, but I think we should look surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg he is half black! Absolutely stupid movie, almost embarrassed even to see this!
