The evil that men do (1984) was one of the few non-gun movies Charlie Bronson made during the 80s. Unlike most of the gun movies Charlie recorded, this was not fun or entertaining. Charlie bases torture and brutalises people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see this! <br /> <br /> In this one, Charlie goes to a US-named Central American country and shows the people that the messenger with Chuck or his people will pay the pipe. This is not fun. It's not cheesy or campy, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this one. I have no love for this movie. No recommendations because it is not worth seeing. Maybe if they don't cut the hell out of it. Look with caution. <br /> <br /> Don't bother.
