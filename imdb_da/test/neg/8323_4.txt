An awful insult to Welles' memory and genius, this senseless collection of self-reliant improvisation on a large theme should have been locked up alongside a number of other unfinished Welles projects that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! To add further insult to past injuries, the horrible English-language dubbing of amateur American dual actors and even the big man raises only all the sheer flaws of narrative and construction. It was as if every weekend some good hearted Spanish souls gave Orson a few pesos, a 35 mm camera and some short ends of negative film back from another production and told Welles to drive out to the Spanish countryside and just keep shooting everything and everything until the film's warehouse ran out. It is true that if Orson had really formed this movie himself instead of the infamous Jesus Franco, he could have thrown out 85% of what he shot, but we never know. As Welles never took time to edit his own work here, and somewhere in the way he or his heirs sanctioned another to do so, he is not completely blameless for debacle. Those who want to prove it in their early days were Welles the luckiest of the young men because he surrounded himself with eg. John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise did not need any better evidence of his adult's inadequacy than this mess of a movie. In his sad age, Welles was able to do something when he needed a few bucks or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. The devil certainly got his fault with this!
