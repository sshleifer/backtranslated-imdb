This movie has made me sad! When I think of cat in the hat. I think of cat in the hat books. You know, from a few years back, parents read to their children. Well, even though this movie would be so much! But much to my surprise was nothing like the books! Insted is more like a young adult humor film. On some, cat speaks to a gardening tool (hoe) the cat speaks to it as if it were his heads (agin adult humor). The naming of his car I all was so unpleasant for a kids movie. during the assessment you will find: mild cude humor and some double-entenders. In short, I mean adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! Wal-Mart said they would not because the movie has been opened. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest maybe renting before you buy.
