Now it's about 1000 years in the future, and we've finally breached to travel the great distance between galaxies !! But unfortunately, we still use guns that shoot bullets, the black men still call each other brothers and become tall, rocky, giant, etc. Common stereotypical urban black men still get the short end of the stick! Babes in tight black rubber pants, similar to those from Baywatch, share close quarters with the captivity and crew. Crippled people still require wheelchairs to move, no fancy cure, implants or robotic legs. Dracula still looks and seems gay. Should I continue ... In short, this movement was shot at a typical sci-fi set of low budget props, actors, and no real special effects to talk about. The beginning, middle and end were pathetic. I have to go out and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for.
