I'd probably like to give this movie a zero if not for climax, which doesn't involve snakes on a train, but rather train in a snake. The prerequisite was cooked up far more than likely during a night of beer after hearing about snakes on an aircraft in production (this was actually released to coincide with the release of the movie). The wit is probably not lost by those who want to search this out; I don't think there would be a soul out there that would consider this as a serious action-thriller effort (unless it is ironic enough beyond the capacity of rational thought). It's about a Mayan curse placed on a woman who is cursed by her family to rely on another man, and is soon seen sick and coughing green slime along with of course snakes. She and her beau go on a train going to Los Angeles, and very soon after more than the clich√©s are characteristic of snakes overtaking the train - with the original woman becoming a snake herself. <br /> <br /> If it would be worth noting more about the movie, I would, but there is not enough time during the day. All that can be said about the quality factor is that it hardly exists; There are students short films with bigger budgets. Perhaps it was a clever calculation of the end of the filmmakers that there would be so many copies sold, just for the jok factor alone, that they would resume their budget in the first weekend. Because by looking at the sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene!), The actors (if you can call them with only another actor - the one with the very thin hair that hits one woman throughout the movie - who has had benefit of the girl produced), FX (also beside non-existent, making the effects in Snakes on a Plane look like Star Wars), and the actual CGI snakes itself with the last big hermetic snake to see in sci-fi movie channel conditions. It essentially means that it is a ridiculous uprising in every step of the way (especially as cruel as it sounds when a little girl gets involved in a snake's "attention"), with the much disregard for good taste that works well in its favor. That being said, it is also 100% disposable, like a B-film sour taste lollipop.
