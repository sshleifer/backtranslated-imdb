In 1904, Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children were kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates, mocking the Moroccan government, thus removing "American pestilence" which attracts US President Theodore Roosevelt. Fictitious historical epic is less a great adventure than it is a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive recall to the desert sheikh films of the 1940s (with a little "The King and I" interjected, except). The portraits of the dressed, mustachiode, bloodthirsty leader and his snippy, haughty captivity, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could work in two completely different films (nobody seems to know how far it is to carry the camp elements in their characters and dialogue, and both seem unambiguous without proper direction). The various (and anonymous) slashes and behemoths that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become blurred, noisy mounting of sand-welded violence to horseback. The pluses: A very rewarded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar nominee, but a loser to John Williams' "Jaws"), fine shooting and filmography. * 1/2 from ****
