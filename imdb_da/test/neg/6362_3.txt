Well, this movie wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be. I expected to give it a star. I chose to give it three. Why? Well, for a cheesy horror / sci-fi movie it's not that bad. Sure the characters are sticky (like their performance - including a young Leonardo DiCaprio), the effects that look good, and the monsters ... well let's just say I've seen some more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools. But there was something about this movie that made me see it to the end. A little bit of humor contributed a little to guessing. And if you've ever wanted to see an alien pass, this movie will let you live your dream. 3.10
