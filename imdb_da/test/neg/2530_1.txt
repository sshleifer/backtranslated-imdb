This movie is the garbage bin, because for many reasons it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also a garbage can. Let me say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is just looking for another way to get into the limelight - and others who are exactly this type of garbage in prison. for the film itself, which is based on the book, was also terrible. The only reason this murder has become such a great book and film was because the guy is related to his family aunts, to the Kennedy family, and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover murders - they are just a family, and Central America need to get over the occupation. This poor guy and his family have been chased by the police for years, they couldn't get tommy, so they went for Micheal. it is amazing that he was in prison with all the evidence that underlines that he did not, in addition to the fact that the limitation law should, among other things, have kept this lawsuit from being brought back after twenty years of love by god, do not see this garbage
