this movie is so incredibly horrible! everything about it was bad. You can't say anything good about this movie, acting, scripting, directing, effects being as bad as each other. even ed wood could have done a better job than this. I strongly recommend keeping away from this movie unless you want to waste about 100 minutes of your life or how long the movie was. I forget. this is the first time i wrote a comment on a movie on IMDb, but this movie was just on tv and i had to let the movie lovers know that this movie sucked balls !!!!!!!!!!!! so if you have any decency left in you. go and rent a much better bad movie like critters 3
