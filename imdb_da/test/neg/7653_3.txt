I watched this movie with a bunch of friends at a Halloween party last night. I must say that the sarcastic comments never ended and I must say they were well deserved. Although I felt that the director was doing well, the bad in their dialogue is just too much cheese. I think I came into this for about an hour before I even realized what it was meant to be trying to drive home. You catch up quite quickly that the whole family is pretty quirky, and something's got rid of them, it's just a little too slow. This movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and much better. The only thing that made it tolerable was the two bottles of wine that I down during the girl. Take people on the slasher movie, for at least I know what to expect from them. This was not my thing, for very dark humor, and the subject matter of cannibalism was a bit explicit and rough. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the part as well as it could have been, and I will give him props for what I normally see him as a drunk goofball or a washed-out giant pilot who likes to kill foreigners. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this horror / comedy movie a very generous 3 out of 10.
