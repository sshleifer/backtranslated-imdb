OKAY. Well, I think it was worthwhile to sit through this one * once, but I won't see it again. There are several things about this movie that annoyed me. First man ... I really hated the characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I have a hard time rationalizing to spend a good while after signs that I really don't care about and can't relate to. It's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; It was that the characters were written in such a way that I just had contempt for them, and when the film went on, I would almost see the sky fall on them. And that brings me to the second problem and a question that I think is at the heart of this movie: Was it the intention to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians who (I guess) wandered around Europe in the 60s? Was the intention to criticize and paralyze them? Or was this movie a kind of warning? My final assessment of the movie (that is, by deciding if there is anything that can be saved here) is related to this question at all. <br /> <br /> Whether or not these characters are really inappropriate, and consequently, it's hard to really give a crap about the plot or what's happening to them. If this was a kind of statement about this generation, the movie becomes a little more tolerable. Obviously, Schroeder is not a kind of geriatric establishment square, so the way he continues here carries more weight than the myriad of stupid AIP films set in or about the 60's counter-culture. <br /> <br /> At the bare minimum, this movie has two things going for it - first the audio track (of course). I like how Cymbaline is used here, and others have mentioned it too, as it takes the lead in the film. I guess if you are a Pink Floyd fan and want to see it for that reason, it is not certain that anything you read here will probably stop you from seeing it anyway (it wouldn't stop me either). For the curiosity about hearing Pink Floyd in a movie can be enough to just get you through this. <br /> <br /> Second, there are some beautiful scenes. Ibiza looks like a lovely place to visit. Maybe I'm just sorry to watch Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in movies, but European movies that take the time to actually show us Europe (the beautiful or the ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <Br /> <br /> But I really don't see any genius here. No revolutionary camera work, not even a morale, tone, message, sensibility or plot that has something new to say. Perhaps it was revolutionary about this just that it came from a guy like Schroeder - a film critical of a mindset that at least partially made his film negotiable. To that extent, it's an honest movie; There is no glorification of the immense profits of the 60s here, which may be something you might expect. In fact, the depiction of the characters in this film closely reflects (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) modern cultural memory of that generation. Oh yeah, pile of (gab) nudity and sex here; Nothing new if you see these kind of movies from this time period. I think it was considered novel or provocative or something at that time. I don't find it offensive or titillating (I doubt you would rather); rather, it just expands the driving period for an already boring movie. In its own way, this particular use of sexuality in film of time (especially European) has become a bit of a clich√©. But I believe in oversight that you cannot blame them; they were in the decade able to "get away with it" and I assume (I guess here) the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in itself (that sexuality was part of life that this generation would not be all weird about, just as their parents were). <br /> <br /> Do you see it? If you are a Pink Floyd fan, then it is probably worth watching. In any case, The Valley is a better movie. I went into this movie and expect pretty much what I got. If you don't normally see these types of arty, avant-garde movies and don't know what to expect, this is bound to be annoying as hell. This is a normal, healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a Pink Floyd fan, I'm not sure why you will spend your time here. I noticed a guy who left a comment had much of this movie, so maybe I'm just missing something. I don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions or something similar to enjoying a movie. But I need some kind of handle - I need to find something to like about a movie, and generally I need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters' situation (excludes some new movie shows, camera work, and so on) . Here there is just nothing to hold on to, except the grandeur of Pink Floyd. Which is * just enough * to make this acceptable. At the absolute minimum, if you are a Pink Floyd fan at first, you will like a little with Cymbaline, I promise.
