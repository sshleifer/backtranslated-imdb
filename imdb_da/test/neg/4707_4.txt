I'm just looking at Goliath Waiting for me to order from my library. I remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to see it with my son. Anyway, the movie was less than 2 hours drive and I thought it was much longer when I first saw it. On the back of the VHS box, it states that Goliath "emtombs a Nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever." The divers were apparently on a hidden mission to retrieve the demonic document. There was not even talk of retrieving this document. The box also says that "the insatiable boiler of the bestial vessel feeds on human blood." It would make this a horror movie, and nothing was revealed in the film about this either. I can't remember the details when I watched TV this year ... but could the back of this box actually be true? Perhaps 3 hours of film revealed more details? <br /> <br /> Just wonder if anyone knows anything about this.
