STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The old Detroit is back with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continues to swallow everything in the path that the construction of the new state town continues and a new threat to be in the form of Cain, a cruel drug addict with delusions of Christian equality, which carries a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his past life that haunts him, it puts tin-plated all over to bring this villain down to open it so that it is scraped into pieces. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP businesswoman suggests plans for his new android stomping, snarling animals on a machine that needs an equally unpleasant test subject for power it - as Cain fits perfectly. After a short mistake in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and definitely score with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a movie that always manages to amaze you every time you see it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of the movies just can't be done again. That said, it is not surprising that a successor was made - it is even less surprising that the successor really pales in relation to the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has made an uncomfortable, somewhat incoherent and elongated movie that cannot capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it tries. And it makes it safe, the funny ads from the first movie that runs no stops, corporate satire aims to be so sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before, but with blood / doing even more than the first movie. The first film got a name for some unpleasant blood-bleeding violence (including that a man's genitals were blown and a man was blown to pieces), but while it was more memorable, the violence on the display here is more sadistic and free nature with a very unpleasant and medieval tone to it. <br /> <br /> But in general, the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy - why do you look at this when you see the original again instead? **
