I have never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad that it left me poor choices but to warn you not to waste those two hours in your life. As an avid WWII historian, I don't even know where to start on how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbines with Korean war bayonet lugs, K98k missing clearing and gaze caps, German uniforms that did not exist, the list could continue forever. Added that it is full of bugs, has literally no plot or climax, and acts on an equal footing with your local high school theater. The quintessential cheesy. <br /> <br /> NOTE ... there are too many good WWII movies out there to waste your time on this junk.
