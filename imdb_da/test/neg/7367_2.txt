From the second time the music (another movie) swelled, and it was movie-hack tripe, I knew I was in a very long trip. Horrendously klich√©d - (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the end) - they didn't use Louisbourg particularly well and the costumes and hair were pretty awful. (My particular favorite makeup moment is that the only way the ages Depardieu on, as far as I could see, was to put a straight hairpiece on him, instead of wavy). I could long go over the ridiculous inaccuracy of the music - the movie could be massively improved by an 18-year-old score. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, it's the horrible moviemusic guy Patrick Doyle, who is responsible for the score - says no More! He should NOT be allowed to be near historic movies - he should stick to the 20th century settings.) "The visit to the remarkable section" was also fun, especially his little visit to Madame Pompadour, who was not particularly convincing. <br /> <br /> I thought the only actor who appeared with the earth in the century was Michael Maloney as James Murray. He absolutely stole the show in all 30 seconds he was on the screen. Tragically, he made you see what the movie might have been. <br /> <br /> The love scenes were a little hot - the two leaders were amazing together. <br /> <br /> The most horrible scene for historians is where they are on the big leavetaking dinner in Britain before Wolfe sails and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of "How is the glass around" aka "Why soldiers why "like it's a bowl. Absolutely sinister failure by historicity, much better to leave it. Thousands of people know the damned song, and thousands more believe in rumors that Wolfe and the company sang it (probably full, not all stuffed like this bunch). Stupid.
