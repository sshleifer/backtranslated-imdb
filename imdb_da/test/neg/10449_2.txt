Plot of this movie is about this submarine builder who is a real bastard, and he will launch his new part that can raise thousands of feet deep. unfortunately he cannot. Oh yes, and he is haunted by the memories of his mother and father being eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets with some scientists who are pretty hot, and they and this crew of about one hundred people sat down on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon who killed his parents. Now the shark in this movie is a really fake look CGI shark. Basically, it's like Shark Attack 3, except for more depressing. If you don't get what I mean, listen. The film's opening credits show "home movies" by the protagonist when he was a child with his parents before they were killed, and there is really sad and depressing piano music playing in the background. You would expect to see a shark or something and you do. a short shadow of the CGI shark floats around in seconds, but that's just it. Also, I can't remember a happy facial expression at all throughout the movie's entire runtime, a majority of the film taking place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even more boring, and all the characters (shark too) die at the end. I thought Sabato would be able to kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl, but no, they all die, and the movie ends with the shark, everything is blown up, and the submarine (with Sabato's broken and burned body in it) sinks into abyss. If you are a happy person and you do not enjoy being depressed, avoid this movie. If you are the opposite, congratulations on finding your movie.
