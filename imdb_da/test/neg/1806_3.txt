If you've ever heard the pun, "the book is always better than the movie," Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I think it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel about the movie because I read the book high with my English class. We discussed each section in detail so I understood the concept quite quickly. I couldn't really understand the plot as well as looking at the movie. It may be because there were no discussions in the class, but it is assumed that this is also because I could not paint my own pictures in my mind about the novel's events. If you are the type of person who believes in the familiar word, let's look at the Heart of Darkness movie from your to-do list.
