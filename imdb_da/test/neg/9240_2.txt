I just saw this yesterday and wanted to read other people who were scathing comments but found some high marks. WHAT ??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There were just as many basic issues with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the spiral twist trying to help but just looks scary (with remarkable exceptions: Ring and Ju-on). This is the case here unless they are not scary. A beautiful Asian woman who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The "Monk" character right up explains everything as a completely natural life cycle; nothing scary there either. But the woman does not get it, she would rather kill herself and her baby so let the poor ghost be reincarnated. My friend and I just laughed as she jumped out of the building twice and the ghost waited until the second time to tell her why she's been following her around. This information would have been nice to know before she started jumping, but regardless. <br /> <br /> * It said I liked a few parts right in the middle. First, she runs a taxi with a ghost (ghosts are driving taxis?), Which has a lot of extra hair that is inexplicably scary. Right after that at the bus stop, you should see it as it's pretty messy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a total bomb, I gave it an extra point just for the two scenes above. This is a poor quality Asian horror that manages to get ghosts flying into the woman's uterus almost beautifully while trying to scare you with the same images.
