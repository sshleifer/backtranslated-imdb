Documentary Definition: A work like a movie or television program that presents political, social or historical issues in a factual and informative way and often consists of actual news movies or interviews accompanied by narrative. The keyword here is informative. I love they could be hunters and hardly learned anything about them. <br /> <br /> Interviews with all celebrities were virtually worthless. I don't care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anyone, and South Straw was pretty annoying. And listening to people does TMBG recite texts that they should be funny / interesting? Nor was it. I think it was the problem: The movie takes time to discuss TMBG's love of coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material fun? None! There were hints that both men are married, but it was never discussed. And what about the solo material they did? What motivated them to do so? These types of questions have not been addressed or answered. <br /> <br /> I could continue with the negatives. I found the segment on Dial-a-Song very interesting. If you want to learn if they might be virgins, just buy a few CDs and listen. Seriously. This movie is a gigantic disappointment. I can't believe so many people gave it a 10. Amazing.
