I finally got a DVD copy of this production and was agog with curiosity when I had read so many people praising it to heaven, especially Angela Lansbury's depiction of Mrs Lovett. I watched the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and too bloody; Luckily, this version is not that terrible, but it does suffer dramatically in many other ways, for it to be least satisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> Initially, the molding is. George Hearn is appropriate and at least shows some expression (unlike Johnny Depp's infinite woodwork in the film). Angela Lansbury is simply annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get points across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's piping and the voiceless little girl's voice, but subtlety only seems to be a word in the dictionary of Mrs Lansbury. You can't be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her all the time, smashes and flashes in a "look, Ma, I'm acting!" fashion and be too attentive to the audience. This is not typical of stage productions, the sky knows. I have been a regular participant in many productions at Stratford Festial for many years, and scenarios do NOT usually behave like that (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment, not!) ... Betsy Joslyn . Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Has anyone, besides me, noticed that she cannot vaguely sing this role herself? And she plays George Hearn's daughter is just unsafe when she was married to him at the time. Shouldn't she be a cute little sixteen year old? Yes, I am aware that this is about acting, but not even convinced me that she was younger than thirty-five, and the term "mutton dressed as lamb" seems to have been patterned just for her. Her slaughter of "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie and it was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal interval Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice that can only be compared to a soprano boy. Every vibrato kills it at all, and Mrs Joslyn spent so much time that she thought she was falling away from her ladder because she shook so much from the effort to maintain coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let's pass over his vibrant play at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher tones ... This is simply not a coloratura role, and perhaps a discerning instructor should have told her - but the fact that she was married to the star could have tied the director's hands. <br /> <br /> Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but again apparently too old for the role, and there is zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Joslyn, which makes the whole sub-plate fall completely flat. I am reminded of some of the last stage of Wagner's Ring Cycle, where due to the vocal power the singers demanded to bend over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra, they had to cast out based on the ability to penetrate into the vocal as opposed to any appearance or play or even a good voice. Therefore, you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Vikinghorned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto requires an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and enchanting. The casting of the "juvenile" leads is just that - if you close your eyes, you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendals Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion is broken. (And in no time can you ever believe in Mrs Joslyn's Johanna ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost due to the fact that three out of the four main characters were so miscast. I can't give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they ruined the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people are robbing this poorly-shot and self-conscious movie recording of a stage play. Surely there is more to camera work in the theater than just plunging a camera down the front row? If I want it, I will go to a decent game, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where they at least work together for the production and not constantly overturn the camera. I only give it three stars because the quality of the production except the antiquity of Lansbury and Joslyn seems appropriate, if not spectacular. It's probably the best thing to do, to buy the movie's soundtrack and a cast recording of this game, and then combine the two to make a tolerable whole. That's what I have to do and try to forget that I have ever bothered to rent this completely inseparable production.
