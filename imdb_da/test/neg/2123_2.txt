A multi-year fixture in IMDb Bottom 100, when you look at this, it's not hard to see exactly why it turns out to fail completely in every bloody section! <br /> <br /> Take the edit to a start; calling this choppy would be all for free! In fact, if the creators of this were drunk one night and cut and cut the film rolls with some scissors and children's glue, then the resulting root could probably not be worse than what we actually have here. In addition, inane history draws mercilessly on what works as a torture infinity before finally reaching the definite unclear climax. <br /> <br /> Apart from the ever-playing Michael Sopkiw, bad ideas from most of the others do not help cast anything, and the actual beastie that causes all problems is somewhat less than convincing to set it least. Yay, all in all, is a complete pile of crap if I've ever seen one. Deary, dear me .... and to believe that Lamberto Bava corrected this .... tut, actually. <br /> <br /> Note: This was released in the UK under the alternative title of Devouring Waves, although it is famous for most of its acting scenes, which, ironically, is the only reason why this may have worth seeing.
