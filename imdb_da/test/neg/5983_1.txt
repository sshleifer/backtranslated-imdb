There is nothing in this that the viewer could point out and call "good". The action was boring and reassured. The sets and cinematography look as if they were developed by someone who grew up in a Starbucks and tried to make the perfect Gap advertisement. Characters have no drive, motivation or reason for us to worry about them. There is such a lack of interest and excitement that it is difficult to follow the banal action and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it would be as boring as anything else. This is not fun, it is not romantic, it does not reflect on the human condition. If you want a good stoner comedy, see Half-Baked; If you want a good stoner drama, see Trainspotting. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's fun to see some famous faces in the mid-late 90s. It's a low reason to give the film another star, but then it's a low movie again.
