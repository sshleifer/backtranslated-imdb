Every evening with Jonathan Ross now means to me that he is in the first hassle and disturbs with carefully selected words a 78-year-old man's phone and then suggests and Russell Brand should remember and masturbate him as he slept as a way of saying sorry to make indecent phone calls to him. Kinky! And illegal. For a really big laugh maybe next time, should he try it on someone he knows well as his boss? Or a supporter of Abu Hamza? Would he be amused if someone made it to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> For many years I have seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC Star Man Ross chat show because I find him so boring, some of the guests I saw were OK though - probably most of them who ever turned out was OK for everything I know. As a chat show, it seems pretty bad though ?? So what's the chatter of asking Tory leader David Cameron about this TV show if he's ever masturbating on Margaret Thatcher's photographs? He chatted to Gwyneth Paltrow just by asking her if she wanted him. However, Ross yob mentality was finally completely exposed to the above revelations, and I thought I would take this opportunity to warn the few decent folk around the world who may not know how horrible this man is and to control him and his - unless you think all comedies should be "edgy" ie indecent / vacuum. We are not yet the same here, although the BBC and Channel 4 strengthen all standards. In October 2008, Ross colleague Russell Brand made a series of pre-understood sexual obscene phone calls to Andrew Sachs 'answering machine (Manuel from Fawlty Towers), had it sent as planned on the BBC's national radio to Sachs' request and then tried to get Sach's grandchildren to burn the evidence if they were prosecuted. A significant number of people above (probably most of those who were not licensors in the BBC) found it fun and / or that the national scandal had been overshadowed, but many people still seemed right, and 42,851 complained to the BBC for the accident the incident. Many unfair media people and others talked that these 42,851 had never heard the radio program (and never would). With their arguments, they probably also assume an event such as the Holocaust justified because at that time relatively few people complained to the media, and none of us here should be horrified by it because we were not there. The two BBC producers who were originally involved in broadcasting it believed that it was "very fun and brilliant" comedy, and only 2 people complained about Brand's radio program at the time - which I fear only stated it Moral level, his 400,000 weekly listeners were sunk with the help of BBC expertise. Very moral BBC tried and failed to use it for remedy in the later OFCOM study. Roll over Aristotle, tell Lord Reith the news! Sachs' agent complained to the BBC, but was ignored by them until a Tory national newspaper got hold of the story. The penalty for any ordinary perver who does this would usually be to dismiss and prosecute, perhaps even to prison, but while Brand and BBC Radio 2's leaders were both eventually ordered to resign to multi-millionaire Ross, a 12-week holiday by the BBC's boss I Assuming he first put Ross's permit, though, he could do Ross's £ 1.5 million payment to prevent him from suing) to return to this program again in 2009 before his contract expires. All the time to think of more smudge and / or more insulting obscenity for his 4,000,000 viewers to admire - but at least he could still still throw his way to the bank to keep his spirits up. Some people believe his position will be untenable and he will not be able to continue. I think his skin is so thick, because the stakes are so high that he will come back unbeaten and reactivate with pent up vitriol. (Update 23/01/09: I just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series - the "most massive cock-up" - to use his baseline - continues to allow this snigger non-promising offender to take public money as so.) But who knows: perhaps in the future after the slimy British film and television industries have consoled him for the moral stance taken by the 42,851 and ravaged him with awards, he becomes a master of his perversion services of the perverts in government. At least, I hope this pair of devoted devotees will meet with other perverted commercial TV and radio stations and stay there, so I'm not paying for their promising law and spitting out illegal obscenities in the future. In 2009, OFCOM UK TV licensees fined £ 150,000 for this "sorry" affair - Thank you Ross for offering to pay! Does not. <br /> <br /> To the apologists: Get a sense of humor / sense of proportion! It's not the end of the world that has a few talented perverts like your heroes, and there are far more important things to worry about in this world, like the price of real cheese! Summary Family Man Dross: A comedy genius for seemingly millions of people (especially himself), just a creepy obscene voicemail that receives an indecent pay packet from an indecent multimedia company to others. So much for our society of Political Correctness and Respect! As you should have guessed, it does not apply to the rich and famous and never will, but only to the poor. To sum up the BBC: Stumbling blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now Rossgate I hope the next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks comedy should always challenge and push boundaries back, ie. Offensive is not challenged or offended by my opinion on this particular offensive pervert, his perverted programs, and his current perverted employers.
