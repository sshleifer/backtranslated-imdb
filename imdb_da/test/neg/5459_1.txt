Anna Kokkino's success with 'Head On' now begins to look as if it was completely dependent on the script and Alex Dimitriade's good lead performance. The degree to which this recent "Revelation Book" is both derived, pretentious and completely unoriginal (except the fine filmography of Tristan Milani) seems to bear this out. . <br /> Unfortunately, there have already been quite a few Aussie films dealing with such themes, some spoiled for "sexism" (and / or explicit sex scenes) in the 1970s and 1980s, and then And maybe they are worth looking at again after this piece of fluff. Of course it puts everything in the ballet world and makes it all painfully slow (and in its choreography, like a 1960s Dutch ballet experimental number), Great Art suggests if you haven't traveled a lot - and only if you've never gone beyond Art Theory 101. <br /> <br /> Add to the pretense, horrible arch dialogue ("you will do as we command ...") and the whole shebang fall on its well-funded face. Then there are the 'sexy' bits: right from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Given the lovely but truncated performance of Colin Friels - what about a true city's primary thriller? <br /> <br /> All in all, along with "Revelation Book", the feminist project has been put back another decade - and with the willing and deeply imitating (of men's authors such as Henry Miller, William Burroughs, and even Bukowski) collaboration between some collective in Melbourne, Oz, suffering from some form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelations await us here.
