A made for the television version of the Dark Heart seemed to be a good way to add more insight to the book, that was the wrong assumption. The movie made it even worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the movie. I hoped the movie might help put the books together, which I didn't understand, but it didn't. It still left me confused and hanging. It's one of those movies that makes one feel that watching the grass grow rather than watching the movie would be fun. Not exactly any cup of tea. It was an extremely horrible, boring and slow movie. <br /> <br /> First, Nicolas Roeg must have been quite desperate when he decided he would do the job of making the already boring book in a movie. It's a guaranteed loss. It's like going into a knife fight, but forget the knife on the kitchen table. The ruthless person is going to lose; and in that case the ruthless person was Roeg. All I've heard about the movie is bad stuff, and the movie deserves the bad things to say about it. From watching the movie, I got the impression that the people who made the movie just dazed over the book to get the key points. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie followed the book's main story line, it excluded a few details and it also changed the end. I'm not a fan of it. Roeg went out when Marlow and his crew came over the Russian sailing camp, and in that camp they found the book. Nor did it turn out when they came to the camp over the sign saying "Wood for you. Hurry." Carefully guard "(Conrad 110) Also, at the end of the book, Kurtz dies on the boat, not on the inner station. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg did a good thing while making his movie; managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie, for example, he bought Tim Roth and John Malkovich, both of whom would later continue to have a successful career, adding a little to the horrible movie, even though I rip His book for strips, I have some respect for him, because it takes a lot of effort to try to get to the heart of the dark. It is not exactly the easiest novel to portray in a movie. Twus a brave effort, though! If for some reason I want someone to actually watch this movie, I suggest first reading Heart of Darkness, so you get all the scenes left by the movie and you won't be completely lost when You see it, but I suggest year really, that you do not read the book and that you really do not see the film; Both will be a complete waste of your time. Trust me. I was forced to do both my English teachers, and now I want the book and the movie not to exist. If either the book or the film is pursued, good luck!
