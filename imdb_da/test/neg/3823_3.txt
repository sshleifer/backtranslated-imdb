Some of the reviewers of this movie were extremely "generous" with praise. I was personally disappointed because, because of these reviews, I was optimistic as opening credits began to roll. <br /> <br /> The all-too-familiar storyline goes like this: Deformed boy and his father live in Louisiana swamp. Local boys ridicule and torment him. Local boys begin Gruesome's, oh sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's cabin on fire with him in it. Dad tries to save his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, meets Elephant Man, but randomly he places a hatch through the child's head instead. Victor becomes a murderous ghost, chasing down unlucky ones entering his domain. Oooo ... scary. One thing I appreciated about the Hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags made me laugh. The thing is, I got tired of Hollywood-polished, B-horror slap sticks. I like to laugh and I enjoy a good scare, but this movie didn't deliver a solid dose either. With regard to Crowley, the next Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead will have a better chance.
