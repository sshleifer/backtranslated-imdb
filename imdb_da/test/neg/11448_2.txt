I've seen this movie n I can say this is really a bad movie. The director has gone nuts ... of course .. he knows a lot about the army, but then he is definitely a cheap guy. Okay ... here's my doubt - ultimately when they save the family (including a girl just raped) ... why do they leave them out of their place? I saw no ambulance around! There are many aspects in the movie that are real ... but then I just want the Major told / helped / assisted some other good instructors n made the movie. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal certainly deserves a better instructor!
