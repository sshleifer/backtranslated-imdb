This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work whose writing is amazing. Unfortunately, this film never moves the feeling that these twentieth century filmmakers do not understand the 19th century repression and desperation Wharton's work portrays. Ward and Dalton are not that bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wave. She had to play the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick all over the film for a long time, and I never thought a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward "Why can't I move you?" At the end of the movie I couldn't help answering: "That's what I've been wondering in the last one and a half hour !!!"
