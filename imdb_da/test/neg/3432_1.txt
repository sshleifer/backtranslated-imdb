I have to say Krasinski is the only reason I saw this movie myself. He is good. But everything else about this movie is so far below average that it is not worth using this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of technical / aesthetic problems: namely shot selection, framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely poor editing (probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shoots) and generally terrible dealings (except Krasinski). It was all too theatrical and presentation) to develop any kind of exciting moment in this movie ... which is surprising because it is about a bank robbery, which must at least be something exciting. How does a movie work this bad get done and then released and distributed? <br /> <br /> Reminds me of a C-film student's dissertation project, probably not even that good.
