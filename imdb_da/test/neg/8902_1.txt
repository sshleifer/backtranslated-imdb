Final repetition of the evil World Bank, IMF, globalization and Americans is blamed for all of Africa's problems. And the movie is long, in two hours, but it works longer. The French actually used Mali, the country where the film takes place, for centuries, but is only peripheral evil. <br /> <br /> Do you learn enough about any of the signs to really worry about what is happening to them? they are quite marginal to the sermon which goes on and on. There is no plot, no sign development, no humor (except for a few pokes at Bush and Wolfowitz, but it's almost cheated, it's so easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre ?? no redemption there. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching on such a large subject and conveying absolutely zero real information. The Irish ballad "I was dying and then came famine" has more content. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring, the subtitles are hard to read, there is no real content on the subject in movies, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this one.
