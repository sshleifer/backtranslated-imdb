I watched this movie a few nights ago and it was terrible! <br /> <br /> Awful long - though they managed to jump through most of their lives! <br /> <br /> Terribly boring - the parts they included were long lasting and for some reason the director chose to cut away some of the actions and left large parts of the film inexplicable! <br /> <br /> Terribly inaccurate - the whole 'mysterious' side to this movie was a joke, and the last time I controlled Ghengis Khan wasn't exactly a good guy! <br /> <br /> Terribly acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacking and deep in depth! <br /> <br /> A scanty grace of the movie was the cinematography. That's why I gave this movie a 2-star rating instead of the absolute minimum! But if you want to see something beautiful, I recommend buying a picture instead! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a terrible waste of my time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give this Mongolian turkey a miss!
