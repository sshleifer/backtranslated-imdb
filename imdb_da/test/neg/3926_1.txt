The performances are better than the rating I have given this work simply because I do not support a movie showing a child or a mentally challenged person how to get, boil and inject drugs into their bodies. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting movie that does not serve any purpose in the world, but to glamor and try to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It carries convincing beliefs that add to my disgust. What did these people think? I couldn't enjoy a movie like this. It is enough to make a person who has never made drugs, think about it, and those who have and have redeemed themselves are considering reversal. I'm surprised it doesn't make every clean junkie that sees it fall off the wagon. There is nothing good about this "film", which stands out more like a How to get strengthened docu- ment. This is the epitome of what's wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Completely disgusting. <br /> <br /> It bets a 1.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Enemy:.
