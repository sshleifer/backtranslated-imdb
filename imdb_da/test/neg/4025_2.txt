I rented this DVD because I'm a big science fiction fan, but this thing (I don't want to call it a movie because it was obviously shot very quickly on video) thought they made it up when they went together. I'm still not sure what that was about. There are these guys dressed in some strange S&M outfits, and I suppose they come from another planet, anyway, don't make much sense in this low, low, low budget film. If it was their first movie, I would cut them a little lax, but I think it's like their 5th movie, and it's really really bad. Very bad, not a good actor is this movie. This director must have been unable to work on a horrible film like this himself. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD, please don't people. It's not even worth the 0.99 cents I paid to rent the DVD. In fact, I want to tell them that the DVD was shaken up to get my money back. I don't believe in giving a bad review, but I have to go here. My advice to everyone involved in this sinking ship - find another profession to enter. How could you make a messy movie like this? I would give this negative stars, if possible, it is so terrible.
