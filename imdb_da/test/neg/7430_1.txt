I really wanted to like this movie. The second movie in the series had this stupid, run in movies feel it was fun (of course I was full too). I saw this movie with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity, the a-la-Mystery Science Theater 3000. I was wrong !!!!! This movie is a god horrible waste of movies and I looked like the other !!!! From the sharp villain with the David Bowie fear wig to the sticky, unpleasant female villains with laughs who could remove the paint from a garage door, it was all just a painful mess. I actually felt bad for Sue Price because the material was under an actress of his stature (it says pretty much everything). A horrible, horrible movie (it's not a recommendation).
