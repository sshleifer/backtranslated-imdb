This movie is truly incredible, in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I saw and heard, and I didn't believe it anyway. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but it was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know what it should sound like, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing that I found more fun was that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was thrown like another by the hillbillies, accentuated to match. Maybe it was a practical joke, come to think of it. I can't think of any other reason for such peculiar casting. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan's Island, appeared in this Broadway game. Can you imagine what part she might have played?
