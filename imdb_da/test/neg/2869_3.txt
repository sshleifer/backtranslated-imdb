I like CKY and Viva La Bam so I couldn't resist this when I saw it at £ 1.99 in Gamestation. It is Bam Mager's debut script, written by herself and Brandon Dicimaillo, and stars throughout the CKY crew (Ryan Dunn, Raab Self, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc.). Brandon is also responsible for the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest benefits - it's quite CKYish in its color scheme - but also progression. Ryan Dunn is essentially very loose. up with girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, named after Vilo Valo by chance?) And Falcone (Bran) plays his best friends who throw destruction by making various stunts. It's a bit like the CKY movies, but with a linear story (which is very basic indeed) and bad acting. It is strange that the usually supercharsmatic gang seems to have sucked life out of them when they know what to say next. The play and script are pretty shaky for the most part, but the other half of the movie is much better than the first (90 minutes is a stretch for the girl herself) and there are a number of redeeming factors such as Tony Hawk's cameo, Dicimaillos subplots such as 'The Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (it's not all cKy and HIM - in fact, Bomfunk MCs steal the movie for the use of music). In the second half of the movie, the sense of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito has a rather prominent role in the latter - and he seems to steal every scene he's in. <br /> <br /> movies will appeal to those who like CKY antics, but only because of the core material and not the filler or the history of line bullshit. Oh, and would anyone tell Bam that skating montages, especially in movies, is sooo 1998. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the package on the DVD is not the movie - but the 40 minutes' Making Of doc . <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab Himself's alcholism and the crew's genuine feelings of each other's incredible greeting (as usual Bam comes across as a bit of a cock, especially against Raab's drinking problem and Ryan Dunn comes on across as a really nice down to earth guy). The last ten minutes of the documentary deal with a friend (who is a rare CKY member) trying to kick heroin while living with the Magera household with the crew - and a caring unit side of gang (espcially Ape and Ryan) really comes on across - an exciting gem in an otherwise boring DVD. <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99 I am very satisfied - though I hope Bam will stick to the improvised and short sketches from now on.
