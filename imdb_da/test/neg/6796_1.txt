I just don't understand why anyone shows one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), they show the average person as a person wearing wranglers / cowboy hat, lectures with a move , has no fashion sense and runs a truck on the way to either "the salon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. I've never even seen a small city politician driving a police car anywhere in Texas. The funny thing is that this is not made for artistic reasons or comedies ... they are actually serious and I think the average person is too stupid to know the difference. The bad scripts and just as bad plays give it away. This show makes heavy shows in the past, as Knightrider looks like high-brow entertainment. At least Knightrider had the talking car.
