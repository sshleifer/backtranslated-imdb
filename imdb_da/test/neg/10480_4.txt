Lame rip-off by QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): The first half is deadly boring, even boring - but the latter stages significantly improve with scenes involving the rampant "monster". In the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair in just 9 minutes, compared to those created for the other titles in the Criterion's "Monsters & Madmen" set), Director Day - admitting not to be a fan of sci-fi genre - trying to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!) ... and I would have tended to be more comfortable with movies I had not recently seen CALTIKI, IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and similar), but much more stylish venture from Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards as the jealous but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the title - is primarily boring, but he eventually manages to achieve the sympathy of belonging when his physical traits are deformed and character evolves a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commanding and older brother is O.K. as a slimmer Glenn Ford type he had previously played in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958), another (and more successful) Richard Gordon-produced sci-fi, which, incidentally, is also available on DVD through Criterion. Italian starlet Marla Landi, struggling with the English language, creates insufficient female leadership; Even her input in the featurette turns out to be of little lasting value! <br /> <br /> Audio Commentary is yet another enjoyable Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon track, including the fact that FIRST MAN IN SPACE was calculated as a dual function by CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958) was brought up - but it was eventually set as an independent release to exploit the current novelty of the present space race; It is also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually named by Bonar Colleano (who tragically died in a traffic accident before the movie's release!). Weaver even reminds a couple of anecdotes from the time he was involved in the production of DVD featurette shot by all humans, ex-cult-ish filmmaker Norman J. Warren: Landi, who had then become the title title, was Still ready to help carry the necessary equipment to film the interview down several stairs! Edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featuret, but once in London he reluctant to cooperate with Weaver - the latter learned that the actor had recently been diagnosed with cancer and he actually died in 2002!
