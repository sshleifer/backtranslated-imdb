That's the answer. The question is: What is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My Name Is Julia Ross." It is one of the best movies noir all the time. Noir or whatever you can call it, it's a very disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> She is fun in one of the worst major studio releases all the time. It would be "Janet Ames Guilt". This one has a scary and promising title. It has a good cast. It has a nice director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe something a little foggy. Instead, it is an uninspired, routine espionage movie. It's pretty much a total drilling. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is captivating. And it's about it.
