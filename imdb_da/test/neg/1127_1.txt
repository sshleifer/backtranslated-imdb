To quote Clark Griswold (in the original Christmas holiday): "WORSE? How could things get worse? Take a look around here, Ellen. We're at the threshold of hell." Little knew Chevy Chase that he describes the "sequel" to one of his best films. Christmas Vacation II puts a new high (or maybe it should be low) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD and thought it would actually be a sequel to the original, but we were seriously disappointed. This movie is LAME. It has no resemblance to the original, is an absolute waste of film and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the accident being part of it. It must have set a record on IMDb for the most bad reviews. I really think we have a good case to win a lawsuit to recover the money we consumers wasted on this movie.
