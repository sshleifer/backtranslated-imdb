(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" goes something like this. Farmer-on-their-luck farmers grow pot to make ends meet. DEA agent blows into the city. The farmers save the pot. The DEA agent leaves town. The end of the story. <br /> <br /> This flick has solid performances of some secondary actors, mediocre direction and such a large manuscript ... but it has no history. And since history is the basis of every drama, "Cash Crop" is a complete failure. Too boring to recommend.
