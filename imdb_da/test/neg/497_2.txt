The idea of ​​nine stupid prisoners who escape and go on a trip sounds pretty good to a movie. Especially because it's supposed to be fun, and I think it's warmly warmed in some strange way. The problem is that the movie was very rarely fun and often just seemed meaningless and unnecessarily rough. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were set up again and again, but no one bothered to finish any of them - there was just no payout. Also, the film was just brainless and had the villains thrown over Japan, even though they left so many criminal victims alive that it was impossible to believe they would not have been caught almost immediately - especially as they continued to use the same stolen camper for days. And as far as it goes wrong, I just needed to see the scene after the scene after the scene of the guys looking along the side of the road. Plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the boys are out to rape! <br /> <br /> All in all, I really hated this movie. And it's a shame as I almost always love Japanese movies - just not badly made and uninteresting like this one.
