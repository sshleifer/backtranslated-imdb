It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to pull out Shakespeare's Othello by bringing it to modern context. But the actors were not convincing enough to pull this out. There were extra bodies to help put everything in perspective, but John Othello, who played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot to this movie and caused Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant to ultimately fall into Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the main character of the movie. He did not provide sufficient evidence that Dessie could cheat on Othello, with Michael Cass, who was played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just played a friend to everyone and gave a reason why she "was" cheated. In the play, it took much more convincingly from Iago to make Othello believe there was something. This change made the film more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based on. However, the film had some good points. It transformed army scenes into more a racist group against blacks, where Othello is the chief of police. These scenes are made credible by the raging crowds and burning fires. You can feel the amount of racism in the movie, more than you can in the book. This book plays the modern scenes by making it much easier to understand than Shakespearian's times were written. In the play Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets Othello position. He never gets what he deserves and never gets caught telling the lie to Othello until it's too late. I saw this as a decline in the movie, because I feel that the villain gets his tax fight out of lying, and in the book he's found out Rodrigo. Overall, the film could have done a better job based on the game than what it did. I feel that the movie director released some of the most important parts of the game mentioned or there to make the game flow, or make it more of a tragedy. I would say that you should read the book first to understand all the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you might find yourself lost and confused.
