Another gray, horrible bit of schlockiness from the Corman family. The first space capsule in the outer space crash returns to the ground (with some of the worst special effects ever) and the pilot seems dead. But notions can deceive. He is actually more alive than the rest of the casting, including a patronizing misogynist old doctor (who is also really really really boring), a greasy guy who seems to have the corner market on hair oil, another guy so boring that he does not even make much of an impression, a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry at the old guy's patronage, and a female photographer with a Farah Fawcett haircut (before Farah of course) and as much liveliness as one dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are some of these people's names? I think it was Steve. Apparently, everyone in the cast, including the women, was called Steve. Nevertheless, the dead pilot shows Steve not only to be alive, but to incubate the baby's aliens (or seahorses, or shrimps or anything) inside his torso. The Momma animal, which implanted these small critters, resembles a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again, I am impressed by the ridiculous ability factor of the monsters created by House of Corman. The Venus Room Carrot in The Conquered World is still officially the worst, most ridiculous monster I've ever seen grace on the screen, but Cormans is always ready to deliver when it comes to bad cheesy-looking monsters. <br /> They have also managed to deliver on their other brands; that is, a dull and confusing plot, long shots (thank god Corman did most of his movie in black and white, as his color files still manage to look somehow gray) two or three places max stupid and lame props and special effects, and lots and lots of boring dialogue. There are only two deaths in the film (if you don't count the roasted parrot ... but it's not blood in the blood at the end of the movie). Cheers rang out through the country, I'm sure when the alien rips the old doctor's head and (apparently) eats it. Now it can speak in English and have doctors' memories. It can also move the pregnant astronaut as if he were Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The apparent intention of the monster is to rebuild his race with people as food and giant wombs. There is a confusing bit at the end (well, more confusing than usual), where the creature tries to explain why it does, but it makes no sense at all. Something about how humanity is following in its race's footsteps and destroying itself by something they will soon create. It never really said what it was. It could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows it. Its baby memories stick instead of letting the foreign shrimp crawl out of his body, and the oily guy (and the other guy) burns the parrot alien to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the smell of roast chicken. The end of the story, where the rest of the characters wander and leave their dead companion on the ground to rot. Oh, hell, why not save yourself the expense of a funeral? I'm sure it was what Corman was thinking when he tried to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
