I simply can't understand how anyone, like a fan, or just anyone, could find this horrible, lazy, poorly written abomination, even extremely fun. It is so embarrassing that it qualifies as a true tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been good. What a shame that all the acting talent, sets, props, goodwill of all involved were so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of strict production and quality control here. Like the hammy Hollywood movies (crazy mad crazy world, casino royal) where the stars just topple for each other and 'have fun', which basically means getting a check to do nothing. <br /> <br /> I could have written a better who send-up in my sleep. In fact, while awake, I have. I did it in year 10 in high school and did it with a bunch of classmates. It was better I look at it now and the gags are more fun. Steven Moffat You're a TALENT BUM! What a waste of what a wasted opportunity. Makes me cry ...
