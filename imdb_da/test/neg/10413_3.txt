Lone Jim is like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are totally losers. Both boys around 30 live at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. I live in the Midwest and I can't mention a family like this. I picked it up because I'm kind of Buscemi acting humor. Now I realize that I need a counteracting agent for that humor to make it work. The actor and the camera's work and editing were fine. The first 15 minutes made you set and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the movie from becoming quite depressing Jerry Springer trailer trash type story. My family members asked me to turn it off, but I figured there should be a turning point at the end and we saw the whole movie. The male family members, as expected, simply left after the first 30 minutes.
