"Garden State" is another of these "indie" -type images that seem to skimp on production values ​​to give the audience some real real human dramas. Strangely enough, the production is very good, and it is also the performances (of some rather big namesakeers). Where the picture is missing is in Zach Braff's script, which apparently is most often deleted by situations taken from other films. <br /> <br /> When you are as young as Braff, you have not lived enough to use film feed experience. The Braff's experience seems to be from watching movies and then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown of New Jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering from a wheelchair for many years. He seems to have no sense of this; he has no relation to his father who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident like a six-year-old, and has no particular despair of losing his mother (in fact he participates in a party right after the funeral as he became invited by a friend of his who works as a grave's grave pitcher). It all tastes a lot of "Beautiful Girls", also about a guy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang out with his old friends, with a little "ordinary people" thrown into the page. <br /> <br /> It's really a miracle Braff could achieve anything at all in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't kill himself) who still lives their "lives" as if they were still in high school, partying with stupid bimbos, drinking and drinking, etc. None of them even recognized him from his television role as "retarded quarterback" (Natalie Portman's character, the most conscious person in the movie, does) and say things like "Hi, I can remember you from junior year". These guys are such losers, for they will see television being a cultural leap forward. Even a friend who made millions invent a silent velcro has no real reason to live, for his entire frame of reference is high school and party. And you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore. <br /> <br /> Braff, it is uncovered, is heavily medicated, who loves "feeling" and deals with something, really like an adult would. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a kind of lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother as a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink dollhouse blown up for lifestyle. At least they fall in love and Braff learns to "feel" again. The clichés come fast and furious. Braff has a long delayed heart to heart talking to his cold, distancing father and telling him what it is and the name of the game. In a scene, Braff and Portman are in the millionaire's house, playing touch errors is in front of a huge fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard movie-schtick, I swear I half expected someone to go up and throw a sled in the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to have his junk refilled and Liebman tells him (in the worst line of the movie) "The body can play tricks on you. I once found my ex-best-friend cufflinks in My wife's bag, and I didn't have an erection for a year and a half. "Obviously, no authorized doctor will ever say it, but it's dirtbag poetry, a Braff's nod to guess his losing friends to tell those that he still thinks of them, like "37" joke in "Clerks" was Kevin Smith's nod to his dirtbag friends. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Braff finds true happiness and comes out of dope; The story is predictable. But if you are going to have a movie that is wall-to-wall clichés, it gives at least some charming performances to breathe into it. And Braff does it. He has the right kind of vacancy, relaxed acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out Andrew both real and exciting, and Natalie Portman (also by Beautiful Girls) gives the film a big lift. With her small features and shimmering mood, she almost steals the picture as her traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in "Shattered Glass") is remarkable as a grave digger. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies, but when people start to celebrate it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. Braff believes that you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and turn on an acoustic rock soundtrack, and it coincides with the material. It doesn't.
