The French do either pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a couple in between. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the latter of this genre. From the opening credits, the viewer tells you which music to play and by whom it is composed, you know that you will be swathed in middle-class precision. It's an old man's movie with a profit of 40 plus people. It is also controlled by an old man with an old crew who has nothing to say about the life of the viewer. The reason is not only banal, but hopefully. How many movies reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? Maybe the director and the actors had low retention capacity? In fact, it's not a profitable plot at all. It's a puzzle with holes like a good piece of French cheese. <br /> <br /> Whether it is appropriate or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle immersed in each scene. I admit it has some well-framed shots, though they couldn't have used a stable camera in this movie - it would have woken them all up! Apart from being a nonsense story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values ​​and vanities in a very comfortable Swiss location. A storyline in the movie is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she doesn't have to lock her car in town! Oh, love me. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Huppert gives a comment about shedding a fake tear to a scene. Smirking says she: "Like they do in American Actor's Studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the player could learn well from the actor's studio. <br /> <br /> If there is a statement that stands out in my heart, it is when Huppert notices that we have friends over the weekend and all the servants are gone '. There was no doubt that they had all escaped their numbness so they were not associated with such a scary movie. <br /> <br /> Safety Medical Note. In the film they show a hot water shell that is covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never be done. Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> Minus 10 points.
