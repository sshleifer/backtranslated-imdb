* SPOILERS! * When I first looked at this, it looked like a good old-fashioned stamp film. I love bluegrass music so I couldn't wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read our back and it sounded even better. The movie was pretty boring in the first half, and now and then a song would be played. Then (I'm embarrassed to write this) came a lesbian love. On the other hand, I was more than a friendship between the teachers, but I certainly had no expectation of nudity and long-standing encounters. I saw this with my mother and I was pretty embarrassed because I picked this movie. But besides that, it was an okay movie. The action was fine, the actor who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I don't care to watch the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after I watched the movie. And there are continuing disks that follow. If I were you, I would skip the movie and just get the music.
