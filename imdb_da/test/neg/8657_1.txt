Yash Raj movies are so much fun, no matter what they follow, but they are called the best production house? See, Bhatt's working movies, they copied the formula, bikini and all plus casting low actors like Uday and Tanishaa <br /> The movie is so horrible that you make you scratch <br /> <br / > The jokes are so bad and cannons it makes you relax. Uday looks like a gay plus a monkey <br /> <br /> Tanishaa looks like an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks we're all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted Music saves grace Camera work is good < br /> <br /> Uday Chopra hams like an idiot Tanishaa resembles Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying there, as Tanishaa is worse, the rest is okay
