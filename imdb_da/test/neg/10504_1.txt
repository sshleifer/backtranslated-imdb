This movie was pathetically horrible. The sound was horrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseous. If you have a life, you can't see this movie because you want to kill yourself. This movie comes completely away from Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie ... or trilogy I should say). I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I saw 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on just how bad this movie is. I really don't know why my family still sees it ... Oh wait, yes I do. They laugh almost nonstop at the stupid act, dialogue and action.
