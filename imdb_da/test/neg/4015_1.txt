I saw the episode of living on the minimum wage. It went as far as an Oprah Winfrey look for that episode. It is bad enough that people struggle to make ends meet week by week. Then this hypocrite has the problem. I did not appreciate the constant complaining of him or his significant others throughout. Queston is how any people have the power to pay their medical bills from ER? that he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance (from his own pocket) subsequently from his "harrowing" experience. How many poor have this kind of privilege after 30 days to pay their bills. Instead, they hunger and "rob Peter to pay Paul". Complaining the entire episode is not a humble thing for him. The movie and restaurant scene is horrible. Another privilege he has that poor people do not do.
