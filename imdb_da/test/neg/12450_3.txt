Slow motion movie with horrible actions on the whole - but lovely places and clothes to admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job as always. I wanted to laugh loudly at voice-overs - so stupid !! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very nice and masculine. This movie is worth seeing just to see him .... and he seems like he walked into a bad dime Romanesque novel, poor guy. Your time would be better spent looking at Mr. Dalton in 1970's "Wuthering Heights" or in the early 1980's BBC version of "Jane Eyre". Poor Sela Ward, so lovely, but then wood .... surely she's been better in other movies.
