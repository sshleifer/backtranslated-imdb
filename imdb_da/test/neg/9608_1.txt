It is really a pity that IMDb does not allow you to give negative votes. This is the most scary horrible show that has ever been on the American public of our normally accurate neighbors in the north. The parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic hag. He is as charming as a suitable fire-burner with the same hygiene standard. She is a wax music mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the whole cast in the VIEW. The children are non-units if she is female and repulsive if you are a man, especially the title person. The boy is a serious challenger for most insane, self-sufficient, arrogant and vain male characters at Disney, who says something. This show was clearly perceived as anti-BRADY BUNCH, but it comes as anti-Christian. And why is the photo so dark?
