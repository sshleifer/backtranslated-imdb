Wakayama Tomisaburo's depiction of fleeting ex-Kaishakunin Ogami Itto felt completely natural. His behavior, his voice, his appearance - it all spoke to disgust. As he entered a room, as well as signs on the screen, I could feel that he didn't belong there, and that his willingness to be there spelled problems. <br /> <br /> I read a place where Mr. Wakayama actually took Kendo (Japanese swordsman) training, and it would explain his comfort with the katana, which proved magnificent in every cutfest. If you see the movies, from the moment he pulls the moment, he turns the sword on as if you were witnessing something inevitably ugly. He would even quickly turn the katana to push the blood out before it shone it, and it would happen without problems. <br /> <br /> Nakamura Kinnosuke's rendition comes across as a rendition. It feels like he's trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. As a result, every time I tried to engage, I would lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role itself. As if it were awkward for him. <br /> <br /> The sword crew in the TV series was also quite old school Hollyweird. The camera cuts to pamper Mr. Nakamura's awkward with the katana, slow action, goal to sit still, etc. Very bad, from a viewer's perspective. There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack when Mr. Nakamura pulled his sword like a child. It was embarrasing. He handled it as if it were heavy! I almost fell off my chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be honest: The story is about an excellent swordman. Period. Swordsmanship is a problem. However, realism is not: the sword game in the movies was excellent and manga-like, as it was supposed to be, I am sure. (The baby cart was equipped with a cluster of automatic, quick firefighters powered by a 3-year-old? Yes ... manga style.) That's how history carefully wraps the historical cultural accuracy, basically superhero fantasy that makes film captivating. (Read Yoshikawa Eiji's Musashi [% Historical Legend]%!) I couldn't really sit through the episodes in the TV series. They just felt cheap. Watch the movies first and you know what I'm talking about.
