Bad, bad, and did I mention badly? Apart from the comic monster terrorizing the workers, the funniest part of the movie was when the farmers were in the desert, and they noticed that they had an hour of daylight back, but you can clearly see from their shadows and the clear sky that it probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT Director! The only cool part of this movie, besides the racket of Clara Bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that Bone Eater rides on. The thing was pretty cool when it chased the farmers on their motorcycles.
