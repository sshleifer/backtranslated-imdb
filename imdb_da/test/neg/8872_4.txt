Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, it's the first to make me think of the term "wasted talents". I had never seen so many fine actors giving such terrible performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, etc.). The "aging" make-up is pretty awful, and to make it worse, shines widely. The use of music (for example, love at first sight for the young aide they camp) is sometimes so caricature that I could feel most spectators around me smiling awkwardly. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been quite a good actor, but I see that he should start thinking about finishing watching this and "les morsures de l'aube". Please Antoine, give up the "master of balantree" project; I doubt you deserve it.
