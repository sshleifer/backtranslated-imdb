On a plane back from London, I saw that she was the man; apparently Air Canada has a crap film policy. Maybe it's not the best way to start reviewing this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to come to a team at a boarding school throughout the city. Even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you should), the story is invisible and ridiculous. There are some humorous moments, mostly from comedian David Cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon does not really inspire emotions, even though it is wisely mixed (with the mindless plausibility). The end is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. I think if I was a 12-year-old girl, I could really have had this.
