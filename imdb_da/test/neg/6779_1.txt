The problem with this - and with all the Vietnam war films - is that they are far too biased. Antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of American soldiers were heroes, while prowar films overlook the fact that many soldiers actually committed atrocities like this one in this movie. This movie sucks. It's time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar, nor liberal or conservative, but ALL UNBIASED.
