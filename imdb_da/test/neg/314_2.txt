Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie, we talk snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value at all, no budget, no gore, Z-grade actors, etc. Etc. This movie was a horrible addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn i be was made !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew Linnea Quigley was in it, and of course she does her obligatory naked shower scene, which is lovely yes. <br /> <br /> But as for the movie .. ...... I fell asleep in the 40 minute scene and had no desire whatsoever to finish it, it's just bigtime lame OK. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I'm an avid fan, a massive fan, I love low budget horror, I love it all, but I hated this rubbish so I think it will tell you everything you need to know about "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, "2" is the 2 minute Linnea shower scene, the movie itself is a total ZERO !!!!
