If you have never read the book and are never going to read it in the future, then continue and watch the movie (6/10). It is a wonderful fantasy film with well-executed CGI, beautiful plays, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book as me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). The story is quite different from the original book. This may explain that the movie is voted 1/10 from people about 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who probably never read the book before and thus do not expect anything. <br /> <br /> Most of the differences between film and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much to worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic of the book works with classical magic rituals effects. (Change of weather, creation of illusions, conversion to animals, ...) In the film, magic is more like "jedi school in the Middle Ages" (TM) (wooden stick instead of light beams). That the devil looks like the emperor palpatine (after part III) doesn't really make it better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not completely cut off as in the movie. In the book, the story is close to Dresden, which Krabat visits once with his master, and he also visits some nearby villages for celebrations. (This part may have been changed to reduce costs.) I also don't understand why the movie is in the hills, while the nearby cemetery is in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole environment is the average operation of the mill's fantasy medieval style. Lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not a proper kitchen, only very hard houses. The book never suggested such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, the champion tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat rejects. Krabat is a place between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film Krabat rejects the master always openly as a stubborn schoolgirl. <br /> <br /> - The film is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth enough about 170x. Okay, the stories are still missing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, some explanations in the book would have been useful and would not cost so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book all the work done on the day is effortless and work at night is like usually work. This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes the boys sweat and sometimes they are happy. - The book explains why only a few "Gesellen" are trying to confront the master: If the master dies for some earthly reasons, "Gesellen" is free and keep their magical powers. If the master dies at the confrontation, everyone will lose their power forever.
