***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Tragic <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It is pervasive violence, its live octopus eats and it is outstanding history. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years. Oh Dae-Su is released to find out he must find his captor in 5 days. Now, however, history may seem poignant to begin with, but once you see this bloated and un-original blood festival, it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a powerful movie. It's steering is on par with the average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboy's play is parallel to boring humor and a bad writer script. <br /> <br /> At times, Oldboy is presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel ashamed of. <br /> <br /> Rating: <br /> Not for everyone, but scope and vision are not clear enough to look beyond the gray abyss. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
