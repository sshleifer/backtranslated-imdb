[As a new decision for this year 2005, I decide to write a comment on each movie I saw in theater (10%) or in DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential feature of the personality. In my country, non-French films are called, and we end up with deviations: French voice is horrible, very far away from the original tone! the same voice for different people or the same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> And if everyone found my comments useless, well in 2006, I'd stop my reviews ... Oh, Ah .... So enjoy them now !!!! ] <br /> <br /> My review means that the story, the locations, the casting are not so much fun ... <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> Sandra bullock is there. She is a talented actress who can get the viewer to catch on the movie .... It is reminiscent of a feminine "the fugitive" .... So if you are looking for a moment to escape your life, this movie looks worse because Sandra's life is a mess. <br /> <br /> She got nothing left to hold on to, only her poor mother (who is Alzheimer's disease: again touching depression) .... In fact, she has a sad life at the beginning of the movie, have a sad life through it, to finally get back to it at the end .. .. what a good ending !!!! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the authors wanted to make a point about a geek's life .... <br /> Very far away from the best computer movie of all time: * WARGAMES *
