I see this movie as a bad tribute to the old slasher movies. Because it really does not hold a light to the golden age of the 70s and 80s with horror, it is of course where personal taste comes in. <br /> <br /> This movie falls right under the category "New Generation of Slashers" in my book, Casting the typical 18-24 years and potential models. I am personally quite tired of the picture in horror movies, the old films have certainly had some variation in people. One or more obese people, and dorks in general. Just plain looking people, of course, having a few good looking is fine, they have always been there. But when the whole cast is just a bunch of fine racks and butter it gets stupid. I mean, OK yes, I like to see HOT chicks. But not in a horror that should reflect some common people being chased by, for example, a knife-cutting lunatic ... You expect the people to be chased to see something like any random person you see in the street. I think. There are, of course, a couple of films with just good looking, which is quite okay, but they are not many. "Wrong turn" is an example of the better. <br /> <br /> The next point is the killing scenes slashers have to deal with. In this poor movie, everything you come to see is 2-3 pictures of sudden loud-sound / screaming and music in crescendo. And that's it. The little one you see is not graphic at all, not for people who have seen some horrors over the years. The families in the old school compared to this had much more and better death, blood and gore. Not to mention the killers in these movies that surpassed the one you see here. <br /> <br /> Watching horror with new approaches due to the originals is more fun and exciting for true horror fans. It appears, the killer in it adds nothing new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. I agree what a person has said before, CGI is something I hate to see. Personally, I make makeups in that sense I am conservative (unless CGI is really well done). But most important of all is to set a good mood, which allows you to "get into the movie", a good background story is a really good thing. Also, revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers eliminates all mysterious feelings that add much of the mood, and doesn't give you much to think about. Like an example: keeping the killer's background a complete mystery to the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean, whether everything about the story or the people in it should be explained or shown in detail, then there is not much content left for the viewer to consider at all ... It's like watching a porn movie and hoping for a good story in the meantime. <br /> <br /> Why oldschools slashers still work, at least for some people. Is because they have established cult films from the era, as they were a new thing, it is certainly hard to make new ones of that kind today. The exception may be for people who are newer to such horror of course. I have noticed that many people like this kind of horror movie, so there is of course no "real taste" for horror movies. But for people out there who might share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference what to expect from this flick.
