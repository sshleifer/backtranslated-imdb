The filmmakers apparently had enough money to afford decent makeup effects, but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly. We never get the chance to see the "monster" move from one place to another - when it happens (presumably), the camera focuses on the "scary" reactions of the people who are nearby. And when a man is attacked by it, he simply seems to hold a lifeless object to himself so that it does not fall to the ground. This is still not the worst "Alien" rip-off around (the two "Xtro" movies are even worse, for example); It is actually enough entertaining if you have 68 (!!) minutes to spare. (* 1/2)
