I rented this type of "soft kernels" before, but I can honestly say that I didn't expect to be in the same type as "Rod Steele: You only live until you die" - which was both sexy and fun. It had a good script, a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall who is warm. The reason I didn't expect this movie was because the box was missing "Must be 18 for rent" sticker. I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". First and foremost, I think that movies must not start with "actors" who draw part of a talent agency (or "actors" repeat). In these films, the "actors" see repetitions highlighting the lack of preparation that was about to separate the real characters in the movie. Okay, after finding out that this was a soft core film, I didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. But the staggering way that the extended video "erotic" scenes are added to what was probably a late pay-cable release is very annoying and easy to speed through without the persistent quality of, says Rod Steele. You know they must have had some money because I think some of it is filmed abroad. I have to say that the main actor is NOT trying to blow up the invisibility test on himself, is one of the most confusing plays I have ever seen. And I've seen Torgo from Manos! It may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and Gabriella Hall). Still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.
