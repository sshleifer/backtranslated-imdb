Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warner's Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of shit. Sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party, but to try and sell this on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. I have seen bad acting in my day, but it is not something that is acting. The hero is almost ridiculous, and he really thinks he's something that judges from his comments on the offers. I hate to see his fan club. The old films did not start with the action in many of the scenes. What the hell was the scene with three of the worst actresses. I have never seen a garden on a ship. They couldn't even emote. I wouldn't mind if they could ever have an ounce of action, but the only one was the translvanian accent guy. I'm sorry, but it's not a smart movie that some people say. I would think that horror movie buffs would be offended by this piece of film.
