This piece of waste belongs in the basement of some moldy old manor houses, where it will never see the light of day again. The only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. I was only amused when the final credits started rolling and I was free to leave the auditorium. What an unmitigated drilling; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. When I die, I pray that I can come back as a ghost and give fever to the moron that wrote this gibberish.
