*** BIG SPOILERS! *** "Flesh Feast" from 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great Veronica Lake career. This has the great reputation of being a terrible stinker, and rightly so, I have to say. As a big fan of low budget Horror / Exploitation, especially from the 70's, I nonetheless chose to see this, mainly because of the sailing rental image on this site, but after seeing it, I had to admit that the picture actually has nothing to do with the movie. The image here on this site is covered by a DVD collection entitled 'Flesh Feast' containing four films including Sergio Martino's 'Mountain of the Cannibal God' and Dal Tenney's 'I Eat Your Skin'. What the collection does not contain, however, is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly rather boring, which is even more pathetic because the movie is only 70 minutes long. Don't be fooled by the title either. The movie is not shudder at all. But it is observed if it is only for its trashiness and especially the extremely stupid but therefore somewhat entertaining end. The film follows a ridiculous plot about Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), a brilliant female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth using meat-eating pots (don't ask how). A bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or anything) paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth to a "mysterious" supreme commander. After an endless hour of uneven drift, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. It was quite clear before, but I still had to jump out laughing because the movie's finale was so incredibly silly and unintentionally fun ... This is a movie that is very inadequate as the last movie of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake. Apart from the lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero budget production like this. However, bad ideas are something I can easily forgive in movies like this. What I cannot forgive, however, is extreme boredom. The last five minutes make this comfortable for hardcore fans of rental units, but I still recommend skipping it.
