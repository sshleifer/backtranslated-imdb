This is the kind of movie I wonder why anyone would have considered doing it from the beginning. That's the kind of movie I can't understand how people put money into it, how the rental store can put the DVD on the shelves. That's the kind of movie I blame myself for renting it. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies and I do not reject the genre. When they are good, they catch interest in the action, they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them. The effects on some of these films support the movie in many cases, and you may like them for the originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and script are on par with cheap comics - just a clich√©. The effects are cheap - and I don't care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other direct errors as in ten other films. You don't care about the characters, you don't laugh and at the end of the movie you wonder if parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery, there are some good places worth a much better movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. This year's worst movie so far.
