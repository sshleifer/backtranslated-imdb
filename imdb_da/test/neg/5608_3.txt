Simply putting these films is without any substance. Just take my word for it and save yourself the time it's a complete DUD !! I would say the characters are one-dimensional, but that would mean that there was some kind of character development. I thought Eric Roberts should jump out a second, it was so close to B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> The girl from the 70's is beautiful ... but unless you're a fan of her stalker type, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid..Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie was just for DVD for a reason ... to be ... it's a train wreck !!!
