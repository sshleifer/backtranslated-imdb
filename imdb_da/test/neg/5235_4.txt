After the lush, inspirational aerial photography in fast motion in the film's opening, it went into complete boredom and a ton of note all the way to the end. Where do I start, well, I start with the characters. I really enjoyed them in the book, here they were all types and one-dimensional morons that either had "sacrifice" or "asshole" written on their forehead from getting going. How someone didn't look through the shop owner Lealand Gaunt (in hammy and out of place performance by Sydrow) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> This movie is lacking in excitement, excitement and somehow yes, entertaining values. It extends for too long with not a lot of pay. Why introduce too many annoying should-die-fast type characters and then forget half of them halfway through? In the book almost everyone who went into the store, a pig met fate. Here was one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the battle between Wilma and Nettie), a letdown and did not have many balls. I'm sorry, but after a screen shot, a boring shooting, and some bickering and then a few explosions just didn't make me. The brutality and transparency of the book was unfortunately missed. The explosion of the church scene was so over the top and poorly executed, suddenly the whole city was in a fight? It had no meaning, and signs that were not introduced all of a sudden are who are these people and why should I break? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and none of the scenes had momentum. I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in this, but the film doesn't give them enough substance for me to give a jam. Amanda Plummer was credible but too pathetic to be really sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character) here it was one for a note. J.T. Walsh was entertaining, but the role was far from interesting or layered. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too classic for the material it supports. It stood out as tender thumbs. Easy there, buddy, easy. Something a little less theatrical I would assume would have worked. <br /> <br /> I will admit that some of the things we did succeed were good enough, I think the director seemed to stay many times though. If you are going to make a movie that reaches 2 hours, make sure you have far more to watch this disaster with the adaptation of Kings' better novels. <br /> <br /> I often find myself laughing at scenes that were supposed to be taken seriously (Ed Harris speaking at the end or the character Hugh Priest in general) and bored and uninterested most of the time. Personally, the director should have done so much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind very sharp filmography to always come out as a decent movie. The movie looks good, but not the look I think this story deserved. I mean, this guy hell ALASKA, not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I'd rather just read the book as you should, as if it's much more entertaining, layered character development, grisly violence and chaos, an unpleasant sense of humor and much more oomph. This is a slaughtered version that doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
