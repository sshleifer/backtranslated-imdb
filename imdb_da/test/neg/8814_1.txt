I'm a big horror movie buff, especially of the 1980's subgenre. Name one ?? I've probably seen it. Last year was a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under the mainstream radar called "Saw" by hitting theaters. I was moderately excited. After hearing nothing about it, I thought it was pretty promising to judge by the previews and the posters (well except those back and white with the cut hands and feet ... they just looked awful!) I watched the movie on the opening night. It was one of my worst experiences. This film was literally mentally and psychologically painful to watch. Because it was scary? ... NO! Because it was one of the most horrible movies I had ever had the displeasure to see! Firstly, the construction of the manuscript and editing was completely horrible, even by horror movie standards. Start a sequence in an interrogation with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived a serial killer's attack and then showed a feedback of what she survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any kind of excitement, but to know that the above victim was quite okay. Sure the reverse beam thing was scary ... but why should I at least feel scared when you just showed that you just showed me she survived the trial? Unfortunately, the entire film was constructed in this way. It starts with two guys in a basement. Then they show flashbacks of how they were abducted ... NOT SCARY! Why? Because we already know what will happen to them, we see how we just SAV the result of the attack. They are nice! Keep up the story! Even more so, the actual story was at best lean. I couldn't care less for these annoying, pitiful excuses for "signs" and the play didn't help. Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly at the end he started crying like a lost infant while he was straining to keep his American accent intact (it didn't seem like the audience I saw this in stitches). This drove him to a rash and an idiotic decision, even the simplest minds would not try. He had other options. Better them. SMARTER ONES. Even given its intense emotional state (terribly communicated through horrible plays), it was still irrational. I didn't buy it. BAD WRITING ALERT! Furthermore, although some sequences were played straight through and flashback-free, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found my foot tapping impatiently waiting for the stupid sequence to end. This happened for the whole movie. I saw every "twist" coming. Twenty minutes in the movie, I had already called the killer's identity, not to mention his connection to his "accomplices" as true as they were on the screen. Better plays may have been able to overshadow the horrible script. Instead, the actors could just as well have "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" tattooed over their forehead. At the end of the movie, I was completely dismayed, I had wasted myself a fragment of my life on this movie, and the whole theater laughed hysterically at the just terrible final. Seriously, you think they saw a Monty Python movie. I would also have laughs if I hadn't been so angry at the film's total and complete inability to do anything it should. When we left, there was (no joke) a line to talk to the theater manager to get the money back (didn't happen). I was absolutely positive that the movie should be a box-office bomb. The following week you couldn't have imagined my shock to find out that "Saw" had hit the number one at the cashier's office and NEVER talked about it (mostly individuals who found "Napoleon Dynamite" to be a thought-provoking epic narrative and thought "satire" was a kind of rubber). I am so completely ill to hear people praising this movie, which I often feel like I should throw up. It is entertainment for mankind's weakest and simple mind. Those who find some weird jigsaw clown puppets on a tricycle threat (it's a doll knocking it over and leaving what's so scary about it?). Don't get me wrong, I own every "Friday the 13th", love my splatter movies, thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was fun, can't get enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface, have a writing on unknown horror gems and rank "Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers" among my Top 10 Favorite Slashers. But I realize that these movies are not the most sophisticated American cinema to offer ?? I appreciate them for what they are ?? Fast, easy fun. "Saw" is cinematic waste. The film is trying to be a smart and semi-sophisticated, scary little thrill, and the bog down to an annoying, annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Terrible on all accounts. Each copy must be incinerated along with its weak-minded fans. Shame on you all. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Case II"? Maybe after I take a double shot of Liquid Drano before I throw my own eyes out and introduce white hot shish-kabob brochettes in my ears and colon. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
