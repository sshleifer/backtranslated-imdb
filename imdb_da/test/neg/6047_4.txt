In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) come to an old building to interrupt the flow. They accidentally activate a portal and arrive in another dimension where Chicago was destroyed by a Spider Queen and inhabited by mutants. The group meets survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse), and finds the inventors of the portal, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They go together and try to rebuild a portal to bring them home again. "Webs" is a reliable plagiarism of "Sliders", only worse. Most of the dialogues seem to be written by someone who has not entered primary school, so imbecile they are. Moreover, the story is illogical, and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is a lot of fun. Richard Grieco's face resembles a white version of Michael Jackson and is horrible. If the viewer shuts down his or her brain, he or she may like this forgettable movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Na Teia do Terror" ("The Horror Web")
