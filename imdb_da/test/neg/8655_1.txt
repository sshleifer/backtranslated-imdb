I would give this movie a 1/10. This film is devoid of ordinary film material and concentrates too much on the current "skin tendencies" in Bollywood movies. I would definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me feel rejected is how could such an impressive banner as Yash Chopra Films ever come to such a horrible production? They may have forgotten to keep an eye out that there is also a wider audience than "adult" audiences who, when exposed to these kinds of brutal films, can destroy their growing mindset and indulge in things without meaning and recognition. <Br /> <br /> On the whole, the movies should not only be entertaining but also contain some sense. Sure, this movie is a huge disappointment to Yash Chopra fans, especially myself. I'm really disappointed with the plot, acting and everything else. Why can't people put in something that can be valued after being confronted with the movies, at least once in the movie? The point is clear. In short, I would like to say, "Terrible - disappointment - Lots of adult material - Lack of sensible" substance "- Missing normal psyche - Worthless - Could get hold of a Cornetto or a Temptation Chocolate instead"
