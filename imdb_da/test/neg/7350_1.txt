Free Willzyx (Stupidest name / title ever) is the worst episode of any of the TV shows I see that include X-Files, Alias, All 3 Law and Orders, All CSIs, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelle's Show, Colbert Report and more. South Park has long been my favorite of the comedy shows because of it's shockingly indecent content and disturbing black comedy. Free Willzyk has NONE of the content I mentioned earlier. It was so tame so unofficially it could have been an episode of Sesam Street. Kyle goes to Sea World, where a couple of workers play a prank on him and make him believe a whale speaks to him. He FRIENDS THE WHALE, REALTIES IT. Hi? This is South Park! the same show that brought you "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "It Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance", and so many more! Not SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh. I actually saw the whole episode, which is 30 minutes in my life, I will never come back. In any case, I was extremely disgusted with this episode and I can't believe the shocking fall in the quality of Matt & Trey's work.
