This movie, while it could be considered a good attempt at comedy, is not what the performances made it to be. The first half is typically Robin Williams stand-up material, though he didn't really make many votes; he was always big on one liners and hit the punchlines ... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program used in the election. here is where net 3 comes in ... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil company wants to close her up ** spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them even if it is not even fleshed out ... this movie could have been one of political brilliance (perhaps with the sorrow of the governments), but it falls short in a stew made by too many chefs
