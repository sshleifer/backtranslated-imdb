This movie has one of the worst protagonists ever. I say this because he is made to be the hero when, depending on what he does in the whole movie, turns up people's lives and causes problems. He can't do anything right, but the film makes him seem like the cool guy everyone should look at. He has temper tantrums at all the wrong times, he has all the wrong positions on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed, he is too curious, too intrusive, too macho, to assume, everyone does the wrong decisions and have no common sense. <br /> <br /> It's about a private detective who is employed by a successful painter to find the woman and son he went out many years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he believes to be her son. But all sorts of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and words. It's made for TV, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is quite entertaining. Johnny Depp is very young in this one and has a terrible 80-haircut. He chews gum and throws a football around for approx. 5 minutes, and that's all we see from him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the VHS version sells this for $ 40 in online auctions. Only Johnny Depp collectors must be. It couldn't be because of the plot. It couldn't be. <br /> <br />
