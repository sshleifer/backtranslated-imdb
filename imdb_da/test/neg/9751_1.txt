Seriously, I don't understand why people are all like "Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a lot of junk! The action is first and foremost ridiculous, and let's not even start talking about the dialogue because it was terrible ... Movies should be entertaining, and I must say that * was not * entertainment. I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed to see it. The music and the dance didn't do anything for me either. And what about Channing Tatum's "hotness" as all the girls talk about? No matter what. The film was pathetic. Don't waste your time - or your money. Unless you're a dancing movie freak, but movies as such are * not * movies ... they're jokes.
