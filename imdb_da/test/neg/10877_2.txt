Quentin Tarantino once said that in order to succeed in the film industry, you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Writer / Actor / Director Larry Bishop seems to have taken that kind of advice a little too literally with Hell Ride and pays tribute to a messy tribute that lends too heavily to his pictures, music, camera work and time-changing storytelling. But to imitate a Tarantino movie properly, one must be able to construct creative conversations; Fortunately, Hell Ride's primary tracking component is the awful rambling and vulgar monologue that only works to awaken and confuse the audience while apologizing to the actors just to be involved. <br /> <br /> Anti-hero protagonist biker once, the Victorians are made up of several vigorous vigilantes that bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless paths. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is hell-bent on revenge and puts off fires. Ghent (Michael Madsen) is just trying to balance his chaotic, psychotic symphony of life with lead in everyone who crosses his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with a hard loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the crooked front, Deuce (David Carradine) is the mastermind who orchestrates from far, but not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits poison and incredible explanations for his tattoos as he strikes harpoon gun and a general contempt for life. Although these characters may sound interesting on paper, when forced to scare awful unimaginable dialogue, any trace of cool disappears faster than the financing of the bishop's next film. While Hell Ride has broken with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its eradicating lies in the ill-conceived talks. And because the bishop's main influences are Tarantino's speech film, there are many of them. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost incomprehensible and would probably make so much sense subdued. At the time Pistolero's biggest press is introduced and certain phrases are used for nausea, you will pray for both death and the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper is having trouble staying cool while spitting out such a foolish dialogue. Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even makes sense? Bishop starts there and then holds the madness until you envy the characters on the screen to have their heads cut off. And when the dialogue finally takes a break, we are treated with sharp shots of naked female oil rules and throats that are cut down. I'm not sure what effect Bishop was hoping to achieve, but I doubt he found it. Hell Ride would like to pay tribute to Quentin Tarantino movies, Robert Rodriguez films, and any movie that overcomes the violent and devil-maybe-caring attitudes of motorcyclists. But even though its intentions may be noble, the horrible cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-stylized timeline-missing editing prevent the audience from being invested with the generic hard characters. At that time, we discover the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be a while before you realize that there is a mystery to be solved), it's just too hard to care for. And while everyone on the screen clearly has fun, they have completely neglected to translate any of the entertainment to the audience. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
