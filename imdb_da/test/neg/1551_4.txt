The 1940s comic book, forbidden today probably because of the "Black Beauty" gag, where Daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse. The whole story takes place in a bookstore where the characters in the books come to life every night. So we have the Ugly Duck (Daffy) and Wallstreet Wolf among others. They win in a hunt for the wolf lurking Daffy with a fake duck (hence the title). <br /> <br /> Hunting is all there is to this little cartoon that has no real appeal today. Only fun if you are a true fan of Looney Tunes, I assume ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
