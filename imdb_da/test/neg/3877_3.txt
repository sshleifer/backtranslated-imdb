I have nothing against followers; sometimes they are better than the original. But many times the originals are best alone. Especially when you can't duplicate the cast. One of the great reasons "The Magnificent Seven" was such a hit was the very popular cast. <br /> <br /> It is hardly the "magnificent seven" when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the members of the famous group in "The Magnificent Seven." With six of the seven guys absent and replaced by much less well-known actors, this loses its appeal in a hurry. In other words, except Brynner, these guys have no charisma! This is one of a championship sports team that marks all substitutions except one. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good once again: fun to watch, fun to hear with the distinctive deep voice of his, but the story, not just the rest of the crew is paralyzed. This movie should never have been made. In original we were about "seven" here we could not fit less.
