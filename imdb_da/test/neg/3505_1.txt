I can't believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. First of all, they used all the cheesy racism clich√© in the book. It was so predictable. From the second, the young latino guy showed you that you just knew he would be a great guy because he looked like a gangster. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a policeman who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some extent at the end of the film. The prediction almost did not end with these signs. A phenomenal casting was wasted on a weak manuscript. The morality of history was PC to the maximum. There were a few clever words, but not nearly enough. Dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn't all bad. I just can't believe this movie's high score so far. It was a little entertaining, just a little offensive to intelligence. I admire what this film was trying to achieve, but it fell well short.
