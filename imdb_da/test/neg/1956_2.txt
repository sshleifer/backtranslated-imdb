Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, I am actually surprised that people are allowed to make these kinds of movies. As Sam and his wife go to Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill the fun and revenge with inbreeding ... Don't take a flip on this movie, most say it's a laugh with your friends But honestly it's a waste of time. If the people who made this movie can get a job doing what they do, at least they can take the time and effort to write a better story, especially the Ostean characters.
