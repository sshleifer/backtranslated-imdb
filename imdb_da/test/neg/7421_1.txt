Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they do not know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and it is still out there waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was a late night when I popped this into my DVD player. I wish I could go back in time and stop me. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" will be the movies you want you never saw. Wrong. This will be. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of shit, but that's the only shit that's haunted me. How I wish I never saw this! Actually, the act is not that bad. It's just writing and controlling and pacing and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not this one. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to my warning. Don't look at this!
