I'm a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men in trees are a complete ban of northern exposure. There are city crowds from New York stuck in a remote city (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She doesn't immediately turn it off with a room (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city only has a pilot that is not often available. Ther is only a radio program. And the whole show is about quirky people with sincere and unequal relationships. Too many parallels. Like Northern Exposure with the exception of an obvious demographic, each character has been changed. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> At the top, writing is pretty good. But if this was a school project, it would surely have served the plagiarism stamp. <br /> <br /> Perhaps people who love this show are protected by the dedicated creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
