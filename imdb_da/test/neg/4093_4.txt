This was a flick dampened by its view. The very idea of ​​it was lama - take a lesser character from a mediocre PG-13 movie, and make a complete non-sequel while changing tone to a PG-rated family movie. I was especially interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but also managed to give away the whole movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, all jokes are told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute Cliff's Notes version of the girl. So of course I didn't have to pay to see it, but when it came to DVD, I probably thought I'd see it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it. <br /> <br /> Nope. I'm still confused as to why he signed in for this. He must have washed someone a favor. The papers were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to go to the very broad comedy style of the original Bruce Almighty's Jim Carrey. But it's just not fun. The studio, of course, tried to make money from the 40-year-old virgin's success, complete with several of Carell's former co-stars, a reference to the girl in a theater market and another musical circus order. But even the talented Carrell can't save this. His co-stars aren't much better, while people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, she is just wasting everything she does, and her terrible lines and reactions just make people stop giving her work. The story itself is just predictable and lazy. It pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing, as Evan's disregard for the environment (driving a gas-guzzling Humvee, choosing to use wood from endangered trees for his house, hates animals ...), and ultimately it is just above the top sermon on both faith and the environment. Why the movie was made at all is amazing enough, but I really don't understand how it was supposedly the most expensive comedy ever. The only real action is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of them into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue / green screen work I've ever seen. Perhaps the rental of live animals at a cost cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate into quality, that's for sure. But hey, it wasn't the worst movie of the year by far. There are still lots of worse duds like Norbit and Death Proof.
