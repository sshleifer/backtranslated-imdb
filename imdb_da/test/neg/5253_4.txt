I've heard many things about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania, and a good part of the movie was filmed here, in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. At the end I was disappointed. It's not as terrible as other users said, but it's definitely bad. It's about a monster that kills people in a 6th century castle, and Lambert, who is going to kill him. Lambert is good as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters suck, and the act is not too good either. Plus, the only thing that could have saved this movie, is the special effects, also very bad, the monster looks awful (not scary but terrible). Oh and another bad thing: the music. The film tries and manages to create the atmosphere of the 6th century. But all the sequences of action are presented on rock music, which is very very bad. I think action on rock works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels - where it's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
