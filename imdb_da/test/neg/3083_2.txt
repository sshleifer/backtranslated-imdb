I watched this movie because Calexico scored. A real disappointment. Annoying, trendy scenes, with urban hipsters and their cliche hip lifestyle. Cheesy stereotypical Mexican border culture (mysterious grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, grandchildren in his mariachi-style restaurant getup). Some laugh, but more than you and lack in sight and basic film-making talent.
