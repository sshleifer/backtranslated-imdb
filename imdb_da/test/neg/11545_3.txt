One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that the mass media - especially television - are usually about four years behind 'underground' media, primarily music. Many believe that Woodstock Generation remained important throughout the 1970s, in fact it was all at Altamont in 1970. In 1972, "underground rock" or "counterculture" had moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black Sabbath, and David Bowie , early metal heads and the so-called 'glam-rockers', who were all 'peace and love' - not. Nor was it in a dark second vein that Charles Manson's family was. <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot for a TV show (which fortunately never was picked up by the network) is trying to express itself with a culture that was already so faded as yesterday's flowers. Scripture must have long since it was produced, author Carlino had already gained recognition for hard mafia revenge cases. And the cultural references are all to "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). The music referred to the soundtrack is actually earlier 1966/67 - by Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat and Sly and Family Stone had blown this kind of pop-pop into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a middle-class family walking down the road to meet hippies. Wow, man, farout, outasight, it's a groovy mindset of a bag. But politics counts for nothing - Vietnam? somewhere in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This average (meaning stale and vacuumy) television movie is only redeemed by Jeff Bridges' surprisingly mature performa NCE as the young college drop-out convincing his parents and grandmother to "discover" ( hippie) America. All the other performances are standard TV show of standard TV actors of the time. The director uses a nice location kinematography, but otherwise the film is a bad way to spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I knew it was over when Sal Mineo commented on a young runaway (who tells the other character they are not really there): "She is a latent existentialist." Wow, far out, groovy. <br /> <br /> A few extra points to be 'so bad, it's fun', but if you don't care about the '70s TV version of the' 60s, stay away.
