I think the movie was one-sided, I saw it recently and found the documentary film typical of Western filmmakers biased without fabric. The fact is that prostitution exists all over the world, not only in Tanzania, and not because of this fishing, there were prostitutes there before the Russians and other businessmen arrived at Mwanza. Poverty is actually endemic in Africa, let alone Tanzania, and it is not because of the fish fillet industry, in fact, the fishing industry has helped millions to support their families in their daily lives. This movie just spoils the good picture of this peace-loving country. As for the arms trade, the film could not substantiate whether there is any truth in the fact that one actually looks critically at the movies, one doubts the authenticity of the film maker. It seems that their attempt to prove their points by using a few characters that can be done for something real. Yes Tanzania is a poor country yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this business. It is just a common scenario in most poor countries in fact the world itself in the Western world ... What a load of waste. The pilot himself talks about sending weapons to Angola, which is more than 2,000 miles south of Tanzania, and the war was also in the DRC miles away from Mwanza. The director couldn't prove how these weapons were transported from Mwanza to the DRC! In short, the films lack focus and respectability, it's pretty easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and have nothing to do Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet ... What a waste of waste! <br /> <br /> The truth is that the Nile Perch has not decimated all other species in the lake as opposed to what the film depicts and also less than 25% of all catches from Lake Victoria are exported, the rest being consumed locally, so let's Get the right one.
