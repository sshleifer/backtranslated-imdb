Two liberated judges step out of the forest and shoot two campers in the head. It's the first scene and it made me win and feared what was in the store. But at the end of the first half hour I was all swept up in the flood of pictures. Not because I used to care at least about any of the characters, but because I was appalled at how horrible the movie was and was curious to see how much it could sink. Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are the former inmates. After killing the two innocent campers, they plow through the woods and wangle their way into Dean Stockwell's isolated cabin and his two sons, lawyer Keith and the alienated homosexual Behr. They initially evade their car's breakdown and they need to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identities. It seems to be known area so far. "Desperate Hours" or "Funny Games" maybe. But - hang on - the gay son is in cahoots with the two. It seems that Stockwell, after discovering his son in flagrant delicto with another man named Billy, kicked Billy around and threw him out. Billy continued to die and Behr now accuses his father of death. And actually, Dad is something of a neanderthal when it comes to parafilies, the fact that he was just found with a secretary, regardless. The grief-stricken Behr was looking for and looking for someone else who had known Billy, one with whom he could share his despair. It turned out to be one of the escapees, and now Behr is determined to see them for their freedom. It all gets twisted after that. People are talking. They talk and talk. They talk continuously. And not about the two crazy murderers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes. No - the dialogue goes something like: "You were just as afraid of something inside yourself that you yourself drove away your own son." It's Behr, the young gay guy who speaks to Stockwell. It's as if an afternoon's domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in a sort of transformation apparatus or cocktail shaker. The only real achievement is given by James Remar as the more talkative and vicious of the two escapees. And it is mainly because of his gruff but floating baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson's and his wide guppy-like lips. He is easy on the eyes and ears. Dean Stockwell has given decent performances, including his inevitable bizarro tournament in "Blue Velvet", where he was my supportive player, but here laziness, accelerating year, or lax direction have shaped his every move and every statement into a stereotype. It's as if he was reading stage directions - "Look surprised" and "shout fire" - and follow them literally. There is no surprise in a cart. <br /> <br /> If homosexual Jason Behr ever blinked, it must have been while I blinked at the same time because I missed it. He has a long neck and only an expression in his instrument. Wool fat as the secondary villain falls into the pinewood woodwork. The lawyer is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he hasn't interrupted his daily job. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the stage works without being least innovative. Sometimes it is confusing. I lost track of where everyone was supposed to be like the killer circles around the cabin porch and the family locked up with a shotgun. I also could not understand how Stockwell could blow through the cabin door, hit Remar and hit him in a back exit from the porch, and then Remar could simply stand up, get off and come up with a sharp scratch like "Okay. Two can play the game. " But why continue? See it if you should.
