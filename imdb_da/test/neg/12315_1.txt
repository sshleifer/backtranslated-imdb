Almost everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take e.g. Mike Myers. He has reached the point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his SNL days over ten years ago. He makes the same sharp stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His cat is painfully unfunny. He's trying too hard. He is a strange type A comedian, not the cool cat he should be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly --- and clearly wasting millions of dollars. (Map cuts to the background buildings would have made more sense than building an entire neighborhood and main street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a great Great Santini impression, but he ends up seeing and hearing incoherently. There is even an indapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- which sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seus history. Avoid this movie for any price people. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they will make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams. Then we have the bad Seuss movie star-spasitc-comedian trilogy.)
