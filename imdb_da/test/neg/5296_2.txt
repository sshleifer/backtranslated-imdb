I really wanted to like this movie. The previews looked marginally fun, but I figured they put most of the fun stuff in the previews. In this case, they did not only do it, but they twisted the clips so they seemed much more fun than they were in the real movie. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, etc. So I wanted to like this movie, but it just never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty and didn't care much about it. Too slow and unfunny for me. This movie is definitely not better and if something is worse. There were many opportunities for some good comic moments, but none of them took it. <br /> <br /> The act was okay, but even John Travolta seemed toned down. Cedric was okay, but he was also ruled to be really fun. Vince Vaughn and Rock were pretty good and ready to be fun, but they just let them pass. I wish they had got a chance to keep up with the fun stuff they created, but instead just kept it back to the same old and back to put Vaughn and Rock up to be fun (though they never got allowed to really deliver the punchline or comedy). All in all, this was a very disappointing movie and I'm glad I only watched it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
