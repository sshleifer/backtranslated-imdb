I've become a big fan of the carpenters, and I really don't enjoy this movie. I feel it focused too much on her anorexia and doesn't let her true personality shine through. I wasn't too happy about Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; Especially knowing that she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide, which clearly was not. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, I thought the film portrayed Agnes (their mother) as horrible. <br /> <br /> I found a couple of scenes that should be harrowing in a way that she sees in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) was quite effective. When the family plays pool and discusses her divorce, she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her weak body moving quite well (which is also the wrong word). , I feel they needed to bring her more bubbly, ornate side - her real personality. Even as the focus of the film, there was really nothing that led you to understand what would lead her to anorexia (of course no one can really know) and almost made it seem unjustified. The movie was more badly singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion. I would assume that they changed their husband's name / business and everything because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad conditions there), but the whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note, I cannot remember the movie that brings her out to a family and children who are very much in her life and explain her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband. On the whole, it ends up as a low-budget television movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan hoping to look beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves / deserves a better movie as a tribute to a wonderful person and a wonderful voice.
