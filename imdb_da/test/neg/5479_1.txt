This could have been the best game ever !! But the game producers have just turned up after 3 murders and the end !! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hitman, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). Yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games ever made. <br /> You combine the four and you get this game !! It has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, fate killings, open world and the HISTORY !! For the first 3 murders you feel this game is greatest !! But after the third, things seem to be so repetitive that you only hope the game ends. <br /> <br /> I played this on a PC and the PC version is horrible with glitches and the silly side tasks are meaningless. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone. This is a good game, but get it either for the XBOX360 or PS3. Don't get it to the PC. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game came from the creators of Prince of Persia. Surely the producer is warm, but the game is not hot and it is no better than the four games mentioned above !!
