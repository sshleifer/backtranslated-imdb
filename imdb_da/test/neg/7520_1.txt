This movie sucked. From the beginning to the end, it was predictable. There was absolutely no chemistry between Pearce and Mumba chick. The ground went nowhere, floating into oblivion. All this led to the movie being very funny in its stupidity. And I would choke Orlando Jones, the guy just gotta go away.
