I watched this movie a few weeks ago and have to say: I wasn't impressed, not at all. I do page with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the discussion sheet I found a review of an anonymous poster that caught some of the key points. It says: "Deed Poll" is a film that raises many questions but hardly corresponds to a few, a movie that disturbs and over any attempt to categorize: an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking Scenes by Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the partially impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) make up coarse plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). Unfortunately, it is true. I wasn't fascinated by the story at all. The protagonists are cold, ambitious people. They do a lot of drugs and have a lot (incestuous) sex. So what? In many cases, the direction seemed to be largely non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was hugely disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the movie? What is the message behind it all? The anonymous reviewer said: "In one way or another Biermann failed to make a clear point and then the film stays in the air without a message. So I'm bored about the movie. The movie is reserved and numb, cold, almost neutral and it takes not long to see the errors: for long stretches, Sean and Ivy characters are not credible (they obviously have difficulties with the English pronunciation), the mute brother's character has not developed very well, some moments are very promising though - in that scene where the caller is the skin (the only true love scene) is reached an intensity that one would love to see the whole movie long. As a spectator one must undo the chances given away. "Again I have to agree. I liked the last scene, especially because of the beautiful faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but it was nothing to the boredom I had to suffer in the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes were, however, aesthetically tuned and perfectly edited.) All in all, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea - a good controversial idea wasted - but it was interesting to see how a movie can be made with almost no money. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, it would have been a better movie.
