As strong as the true story of Phoolan, this book, based on this film, came out before she was released from prison herself and got the chance to tell it. <br /> <br /> It's supposedly based on her diaries, but she's illiterate. How does it work? <br /> <br /> That said, some areas of his movie are accurate and the play is not bad, with some sensitivity shown. <br /> <br /> Really though this story should be old in a television series. Too much happens to get a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Read his autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a great story.
