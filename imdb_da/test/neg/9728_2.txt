"No one really knows how the Force came to be. Not even the Book of Judgment registered its beginnings, but those who master it have always been chased? Ipswich's families formed a secrecy? Bla bla bla" After this intro, we suddenly see the. Or was it N'Synch? Backstreet Boys, maybe? Now I do not know which of them they belong to, but one thing is certain: Salem's descendants are a gangster. Can you tell them apart? I couldn't. If you can tell me which is what, I would very much appreciate it. These boy-band boys look so smooth out ?? Seriously now. Is it a horror movie or a movie for teenie-boppers? It is sad that the (yet weak) horror genre has been kidnapped by teenagers. And this is one of the teenest I have seen so far. The film is visually solid, but the cast is so bland, it seems so terrible that it was an attempt to finish the movie. Probably as cast (despite all boy-bands and fashion models are rarely good actors) the absolute "stand-out" in this regard was the guy who played the villain Sebastian Stan. This guy's overactive is right up there with the worst in the film's history. I have rarely seen anyone doing such annoying and stupid grimaces in such a short time. What's worse, he has the most baby-face on all boy's baby-faces all over cast. I mean, it's a joke.
