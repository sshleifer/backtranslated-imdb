This movie seemed to be put together very quickly in both plot and graphics. My two daughters were ready to walk 30 minutes before the end of the movie, which rarely happens when we go to the theaters. This was a Nickelodeon Production and it would have been better if they had released it on t.v. station. The animation even in some parts was ok. but the plot was terrible. A classic tale of a son trying to meet a father's expectations is used in many children movies, but the animation or graphics must be really good at keeping a child's attention. This was not the case with this movie. There were also awkward elements between the leading male character and the leading female character that the plot could have done without.
