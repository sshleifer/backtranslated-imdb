Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins slumps over the pond to take over the American legal system around 1971 with this priceless piece of ridiculous paranoia that so far backs that it constantly falls. Watkins is a pure tourist as he gathers this to our gang-tragedy with clich√©s, hippies, and black revolutionaries set against triggering happy police and military and a kangaroo court consisting of disapproving calcified adults who form bad fashion records. Talk about a revolution. In Punishment Park, we have radical youth against the corrupt system, as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of prison or a three-day trek over Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course, law enforcement officers who monitor their journey are not playing fair and combined with the stifling heat, the fate of our destiny looks sealed. Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting and theme. Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout threats by a hardcore love or leave the group of Inquisitors (as members of Silent Majority for a peaceful America) being spoken back. Each group does not spend much time listening to the other, and the case even takes a teenager's fight over the keys to the car's appearance. For the most part, it is just one side that says what's wrong with America, the other says what suits nobody's offering solutions for change. Meanwhile, the Punishment Park martyrs stumble upon the dessert infinitely, while police with weapons act as twelve-year-olds. That kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70s college film production class when we were younger and knew more than we do now. Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt force. Culledon was a strong accusation of military cruelty in Scotland from the 18th century, which still resonates. War games are a raw calming look at nuclear demand that must be required for everyone. Punishment Park has its value, but for anything other than calculated reason. Watkins vision today is a textbook example on the left in the full tilt counter culture of the 70s paranoia and given times (Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7) such strong hysteria seemed not so great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever has fallen, and Penalty Park with the unobstructed narrow view is a pretty silly ride.
