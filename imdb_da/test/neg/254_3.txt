The usual disclaimer - I don't give 1 star rating for movies that are harmless, bad, low budget and stupid, even though they may deserve it. These movies are often fun and get character 2-4 based on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary movie artistry. This film fits perfectly with this model. It is a Mexican monster movie, riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak non-special effects. The makeup is not that bad and the play is sometimes quite entertaining, but this movie is almost as silly as Aliens vs Predator and the script is not half as smooth (Aliens vs Predator can get a 1 from me, but I would like to see it again before I commit). <br /> <br /> The reason is ridiculous, but terribly horrified. If you've read this far, you really need to know ... A group of remarkably unscientific researchers consists of the main characters. Most of them are heroes - kind - but you are (of course) sour and right pervert. This crazy scientist discovers a ridiculous nuclear-powered robot (which looks a bit like the Wizard of the Wizard, but has a human face inexplicably placed inside the head). An Aztec mummy discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife just happened to be an Aztec princess in an earlier life (don't ask) is set against the robot for the big "climax" to put it most stoic movie guard on the floor in abdomen. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, considering the budget and the complete fragility of the script, this is a very entertaining low-budget goofball monster movie. If you are in that kind of thing, go for it.
