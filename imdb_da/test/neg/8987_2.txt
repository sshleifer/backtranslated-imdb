Let me first say that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been good, but the film is not. <br /> <br /> I have spent all my life in the Peidmont region of NC. I've never heard southern accents as ridiculous as those in this movie. I have lived in two small NC towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On the other hand, you meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never hit a city where everyone speaks as a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. In response to Gore_Won from the Atheist community. Your comments reveal more about your combed psyche than it does about the movie. If we were to stretch our imagination and pretend that there is something realistic in this movie - as it is not - then the truth is that bad people like Tory's father will always find some reasons for their actions. The author chose religion as opposed to Tory's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that "the true nature of the gospel" leads a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and misinformed interpretation I have ever heard. Before you begin to endure the gospels, you may have to read them first. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and incredibly the majority of the time. In particular, many of the things Kade said to Tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context or way they are. <br /> <br /> The "exciting twist" at the end of the movie is lame, predictable, and lacking in credibility. Some have also claimed that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this movie, but the truth is that the bitter character is also an outdated, predictable, one-dimensional character. Is it Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between watching this movie and a 20-year-old Muppet Show, I recommend the Muppet Show.
