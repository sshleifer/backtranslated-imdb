This is a low-key cold war propaganda movie crossed with a soapie. It may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of the 1950's American thinking, but there is little else to praise in the mawkish storylin, wood-acting and lattice style. There are some interesting pictures of long-haul aircraft, but it wasn't enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the full-length screen.
