This movie features the worst-performing performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never once felt in this movie that Spilsbury was eager for anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's portrayal. <br /> <br /> There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you do not get the impression they want to hang out with each other. Plus, sidekick has the more interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is predictable and boring. The story is amazingly bad, and if you are familiar with Hukards Dukes, you can see what this is. I can't believe the director would accept this. It offended me as a seer by explaining every plot line I just saw. <br /> <br /> Hi, at least the horses and the sites looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a film photographer as your director. <br /> RATING-2 You might see it here for laughing or demonstrating to a stranger what a bad movie is.
