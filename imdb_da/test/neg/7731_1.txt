I watched this movie in the theater when it first came out, I'm sorry to say, and it was one of only a few movies I've ever wanted to leave early. I had no problem with the substance content and I could see how this warning story could have been strong. The problem was that the filmmaker, who worked with James Woods and Sean Young, drew two of the least gracious characters I've ever seen in movies. I hated this couple and could not have cared less if they sank directly to the inevitable bottom. Their was not a surprise in this movie. Each event was so painfully obvious that I felt I could have written the script itself; although I think I would have done a better job. I heard subsequent nightmare stories about the events on the set between Sean Young and James Woods, just like some stalking events. It made me wonder if the horrible spectacle arose from some bad feelings and dysfunction. Anyway, I'm referring to Boost as the worst movie I've ever paid money to see.
