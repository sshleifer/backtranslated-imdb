I assume for 1961 that this movie should be "cool" but looking back now (45 years), it was fun just as stupid as it is entertainment value! Granted, the special effects work well on T.V. with the series that started in 1964, but for the BIG screen ?? I once had an aquarium that was just as exciting! I have to agree with the octopus scene near the end where it is attached to the ocean view. Of course not well staged ... or educated! All in all, it is pretty bad to deal with spooky special effects and I still recommend it - for fun laughing blame. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films and I think he was thinking a lot about it. Barabara Eden continued to play "Genie" at T.V. Micheal Ansara was her husband. Now it's a cool part about this movie! I've always had fun watching spouse husband and wife team staring in the same movie. Nice!
