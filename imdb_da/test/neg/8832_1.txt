I have seen the RED of ALL EVIL with the forgiven object of rejecting this so-called scientific atheist. I do not know where to start, as he is such a rich source of stupidity. Of course, he is not a statistician, the odds of 2/1 of him who burns for all eternity would have pushed him against faith in God <br /> <br /> He regards science as a religion and expects us to believe in him as we do God. You only have to look at the language used in his postings. <br /> <br /> Regarding faith. This product is widely used in everyday behavior. Just think about it. When he comes to an electrician, he thinks it will be connected properly and reliably switches on the switch. When he comes in a plumber, he pulls the chain into his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. With regard to belief in science When I was in chemistry class, I believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and onion skin theory of electrons, both of which have now been discounted. I was taught here as the atomic theory "written in stone" to say. So why should we believe in any scientist, especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins says religion will be the downfall of civilization. Religion is civilization. Can he or any other atheist tell us which civilization was founded and raised by atheism, barbarism or savagery? He now lives in the final stages of a Christian based civilization and takes all the benefits of it without any access to his source. I found Dawkins to be arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, an obvious believer in eugenics, and a Nazi in his attitude towards the youth. How dare he say what a parent can teach their child. The child is their, not the nation, and as their parents note their genetics, they note their beliefs. His dismissal of Adam as "he never existed" as he has no evidence was an example of the same attitude. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he can do it. I just haven't found the proof yet. It Does Not Reject His Existence I notice his argument with the bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Now it also does Dawkins. Where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement? He is also selective. I heard a lot when Dawkins came up with the ALTRUIST gene. What a hoot. He is desperately looking for evidence of his wackiness, and as Piltdown Man was invented, so now we have this so-called ALTRUIST gene that predicts us to take care of our young and other members of our group. The problem is that all animals do it - not just monkeys, and with evolution it is the most sensitive survival. not the friendliest, and if he really believes that we are children as a race, he does not read the same newspapers as I am, I found his arrogance convinced to deny that since we only have this life, we should enjoy it fully. So how does he respond to this with his obvious position as a prosperous European to a poor person in Africa who has caused the whole family to annihilate and probably rape and hunger. Will he help her? I note that all his opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. Well G Chesterton stated that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b) we are opposed to using contraception and abortion and homosexuality. All sin against the sixth commandment. Funny it. As a Catholic, I find his dismissal of Pius XII's statement on the dogma of assumption in 1958 to be erroneous. He, Pius, never said it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere alone. If Dawkins does not know it, the revelation ended with the last apostle. Pius would have taken many years of counseling and studied documents handed down over the centuries to reach this statement. Also, as a Catholic, I find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied. what a complete nonsense. We fight everyday for the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the Church's militant. We can also enjoy a sunset and admire the beauties of nature, even though we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he interviewed whacky keys and extrapolated them to us all.
