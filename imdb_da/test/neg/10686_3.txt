The animal eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After watching Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The biggest was when the guy ate his head from the mouse. But they were so quick and few that they didn't bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was just interesting. I always like to hear the silly voice-overs. They never sound like what you think the actor / actor would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors used by the princesses. The shots of weird-looking bugs were also chilly. The youngest princess looked really young, almost 14 or something. The battle scenes were not as long and boring as most battle scenes, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
