I can't see the feeling that I'm going through so much trouble making a movie like this, and then throwing the storybook out of the window. There wasn't a single detail in that movie, except for the fact that Richtofen died, which I was grateful for at the end so I didn't have to look any more. Movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about WWI aviation history. <br /> <br /> I want to skip the fact that they flew Fokker DVII in 1916 because Blue Max did it too or the 209 squadron flying SE-5 and will attack other parts. For one thing they call Palatinate D-III an "old Albatross" at the beginning. For another, they have Voss, Goring and Wolff all in Jasta Boelcke. The only one in the Jasta was Voss, and he joined Boelcke's death. Richtofen was not guilty of Boecke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, had swung to avoid a British aircraft that Richtofen was chasing. When Richtofen received the head wound, it was simultaneously attacking an FE-2d two-seater and he did not crash into trenches and soldiers fought over him, and NO. Vanderer Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic games in WWI. <br /> <br /> Manfred was short, not like the actor who towed over everyone else. His brother Lothar was also not in Jasta Boelcke, he joined the squadron when Manfred was in charge of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other clear errors in historical fact that I will let them go except maybe the worst one, the death scene. In the film, Manfred is extroverted by Brown and then shot down, making a perfect landing. Brown knocked out a burst at Richtofen, while Richtofen chased May, and the facts gathered over the years showed overwhelmingly that Richtofen was killed by earthquake, not by Brown. The only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves, which were as good as 'The Blue Max', except that I won't see it again and I paid $ 30 for the tape!
