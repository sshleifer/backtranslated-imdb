I wish I knew what to do about a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts - action sequences and personal dramas on land. It follows Ashton Kutsher through the survival swim school, run by chief executive Kevin Costner, then to Alaska, where a few spectacular rescues take place, the latter resulting in death. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the scenes on the beach beat me so stereotypically in so many ways that they should be infant. A typical bar room fights between marines and the Coast Guardsmen ("puddle pirates"). The experienced old-time Costner, who is like an older bar tender, tells him, "Married to the Coast Guard." The older boss, who "tries to prove to himself that he is still nineteen." The neglected ex-wife of the country to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands that the instructors put on swimmers all in the pursuit of a higher goal. The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we've seen it all before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climatic scene has elements shamelessly drawn from "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm." None of it is fresh, and none of the old stereotypical characters and situations are handled with any originality. It works best as a kind of documentary for what is happening in the swimmer's school, and what can happen subsequently even that is a little weak because we do not get much in the way of teaching. It is mostly personal conflict, romance and excitement about leaching. It is a shame because the U.S.A. Coast Guard is a noble outfit, its official mission is "the safety of life and property at sea." In wartime, it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in fighting roles. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks. But again, we don't learn much about it. We don't really learn much about anything. The film is run in a number of visual displays and not too much else. A disappointment.
