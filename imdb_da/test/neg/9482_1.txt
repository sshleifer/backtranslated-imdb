Okay, I saw this movie. Someone has to kick me. Why should Olsen twins insist on submitting this world to this scary torture? This was another movie about watching the Olsen twins travel to an exotic place, meet some cute guys, look nice and get everyone to fold over them. The direction, plot development, ugh the actor. I don't know about the US, but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to jump on the bike with a guy you met, 10 minutes back. Although I am convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that one day we will see a movie with an original, even slightly plausible plot.
