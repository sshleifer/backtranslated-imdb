"In the swirling summer of 1958, Deuces, a gang of Brooklyn toes, finds their square threatened when the leader of a rival gang, Vipers, is released from prison. Leon (Stephen Dorff), Deuces' leader, tries to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep Vipers out, but when his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sultry and dangerous relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), a Viper's sister and his own girlfriend are brutally attacked, Leon and his gang are thrown into an all-out war to save his brother, his girl - and his neighborhood! "according to the DVD sleeve description. There are absolutely no "basketball diaries". <br /> <br /> Think of it as "West Side Story" hit across the head with baseball bats and steel tubes, stickball has left Brooklyn with Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some great Hollywood sets, 1950s cars and soundtrack songs; and much of it is nicely photographed by John A. Alonzo. The story and the direction never go beyond these forces, allowing the film to germinate during opening hours and continue downhill. The cast looks good when you read the credits, but translates into an aging, blabby mess of fake pompadores, blood and Brylcreem ?? and a fear wig. A feeling of sadness and regret permeates production. <br /> <br /> *** Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
