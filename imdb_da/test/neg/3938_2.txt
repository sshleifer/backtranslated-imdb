Good idea .... shame about the actual movie. Would it like to be a little more scary and explain more about the characters and who exactly the evil woman was? If she tortured these children, why did they help her kill and not help others kill her? It's a bit of one coming down from Malcolm in the middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would have been a little longer and go into detail with the characters, though after an hour I wondered when it would end !! <br /> <br /> Would also have been better too, if the actual characters who killed them were not computerized in reality, it kind of made them crap looking. And what happened to the Frankie Munitz character? He fell into a bed of wild roses so it should be safe, but the computer game showed him as a game over, ie. death. Next thing he looks with the annoying blonde lass to save the guy who is afraid of fire, as I noticed, had no trouble turning the lighter when demon lady was after him !! Too many discrepancies in this movie to really enjoy it, but maybe make you think twice about playing the new computer game !!
