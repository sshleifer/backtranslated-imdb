This movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and badly acted. All the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The film was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian figures are more sacred than you, and they are without a shame of compassion for the skeptical or indefinite characters. The film was a really "gotcha" for both the skeptical character and myself as a seer, and put us in a very unpleasant situation. I complained to the theater management and got a free pass for another movie. I remember another movie about a similar topic, "The Rapture", starring Mimi Rogers, it was much better and professionally done. I think I'll see "The Rapture" again. If you participate in "Unidentified" and don't like it, don't say I haven't warned you.
