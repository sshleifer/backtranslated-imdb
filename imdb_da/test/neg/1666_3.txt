This is probably my least favorite episode. I lived in Cape Girardeau for some time. I can tell you that there are no sea or shrimp boats, fresh crabs or scallops anywhere near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only landscaping on the Mississippi River. It looked like the license plates from Mississippi, which could explain why there was so much racism. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in and out of town and none of them are Route 6 or Route 666. The whole inaccuracy was very distracting. Also, Cassie didn't look like someone who wants to hang around Dean, if she was well educated. I didn't buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the long love scene. Yes it was more dean's style.
