The TV show was slowly moving and the "offbeat" signs were sometimes annoying. Only through fast-moving miracles I could do it through the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The writing suggests that it is a kind of comedy / mystery, but I didn't see much of it. <br /> <br /> If it really ceases after the first 2 hours, let me know because I doubt I will see the rest without a recommendation. This review should be without spoiler, so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. I found myself asking 'Would a normal adult do it?' The man with hedge trimmer looking out the window was annoying and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetic. Would a normal adult put up with someone as annoying as him?
