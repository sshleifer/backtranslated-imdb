I love this movie. Although I classified it as a "4", it is because the play, plot and budget were all slated to the "B" universe even before this movie was released. But it's okay! It's an entertaining movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 from outer space": a movie so bad that it's great! Missing UFO-alien plot, The Thing the Could not Die builds on the supernatural (divination, a buried head looking for the body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell his story. The action is stolen, the camera works in second class and the settings are limited, but boy! What a movie! This movie is available on the bootleg market. If you find a copy, buy it!
