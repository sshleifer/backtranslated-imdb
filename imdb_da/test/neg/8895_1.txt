I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to an end when Angel only got an extra season. But when the end came closer, I was happy to see it. And what did we get? This episode is called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the very first. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed with this episode. This is definitely the worst way to this series. Why couldn't it have a good ending? Why did some of the main characters have to die? Why didn't Angel become a human and was reunited with Buffy again? No, Angel must sign this bloody piece of paper that he never becomes a human. How stupid. <br /> <br /> And the end is a cliffhanger. What could have been worse? The buffyshow started as big as Angel, but the hole universe ended so crazy. Someone should spell the man who wrote the manuscript for this episode and make sure he gets lost in hell. <br /> <br /> So don't bother to see this, it's so bad it hurts! Totally 1 in 10.
