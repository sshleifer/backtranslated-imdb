Before the days of home video, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy "Kill or Cure" was known - to the extent known - only because a few sequences were included in Robert Youngson's compilation film 'Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20's. Youngson knew what he was doing : The best gags in "Kill or Cure" were brought intact in its compilation, while the rest of this only mildly fun comedy was at Youngson's living room. Laurel portrays A commercial traveler who cried a patent medicine, cried Professor IO Your Knox-All: this name is the funniest joke in this movie, which doesn't say much. I must point out that this film dates from 1923, the ban of the ban. During the ban many Americans purchased patent medicine if they had (ahem!) 'Medical' properties, so if Knox-All contains alcohol - Stan's job in this movie is less desperate than the one he and Ollie had famous in 'Big Business'. selling Christmas trees in the summer. Too bad for this movie, it's not as fun as 'Big Business'. <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but do not hear him in this silent movie), delivering an exciting sales conversation with a man who seems to be aware ... until we learn they are outside a deafening institution and this man is deaf. A haughty woman comes out of the gates: Stan is trying to get involved quickly by twisting her fingers. Of course she is not deaf and she immediately strikes him with her umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, NOT because it involves deaf people (deaf are not the scales of the forest), but because it abolishes the very common misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by simply waking their fingers randomly and performing Charades without actually learning the very complex grammar of sign language. <br /> <br /> More entertaining has a spinster in this movie a pet canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a gag involving trick photography to allow a man to hide behind an object that is narrower than his body. I have seen this unit in several cartoons and live action movies, but 'Kill or Cure' is, in my opinion, the earliest movie to use that I've seen so far. Stan Laurel, an underrated actor, does a bit of physical business here, worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, conveying his feelings - and a change in his attitude - as he walks off the camera with his back to us. Still, Laurel never became a first-rate comedian before joining Oliver Hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever. 'Kill or Cure' links almost 3 out of 10.
