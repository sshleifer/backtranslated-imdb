I watched this movie when I was a boy (before World War II) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Saw it again after sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not an "A" movie. No editing, bad script, weak acting and not very direct. Shouldn't even be as high as a "B" Had a laugh at how relieved I have been over the years. I think it was good when I originally saw it.
