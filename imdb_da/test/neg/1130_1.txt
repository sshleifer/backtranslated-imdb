I watched this movie last night, and let me say it's the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train wreck, and it's not the actors. That's the horrible script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Okay, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. His nerd son is disappointed. The bathroom gets crazy. <br /> <br /> He gets a free vacation. He joins Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their boats break. They stay on an island. They are stupid and do not disturb even the nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, so that's it. What makes this movie pathetic is humor. It's so angry, hillybillyish and stupid, you can't even laugh. And that is also not foolishly funny humor. I couldn't laugh the whole thing.
