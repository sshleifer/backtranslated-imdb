Ah, here it is! A movie that people say about reminding me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was a fool to believe it, and OUCH how my hams hurt after compelling me to see this c ** p from the beginning to the end. After the first 10-15 minutes I just wanted to end it all, or at least they could have put some nudity or action or cold house music into it to make it worth the time ... But no when I was through with that i put it in my cd shelf and i hope i will never have to pick it out again just to show it to a friend who is so eager to see that he / she will not listen to my warnings.
