I looked at the Halloween episode ... Oh my God, I would die. The action was just awful. The lines were spoken with absolutely no conviction. It's a bad idea for a show too, I mean, who would see some webshow in real life? Miranda Cosgrove was great in a supportive role in Drake and Josh, but does not have the power to anchor her own show. I'm even more worried because she leaves is a major reason why Drake and Josh ended. She was contacted with her own show ... she jumped ship on Drake and Josh. They then decided that they might do something with Drake and Josh who moved to college, thus explaining the loss of Meagan as a sign, but Drake had already thought about moving on to bigger and better things, and he thought if Miranda Did it, why couldn't it. The best part of the show was the theme song ... a catchy, good tune in a mire of mediocrity. Of course, Drake Bell speaks for Miranda's voice for it all and wrote the melody ...
