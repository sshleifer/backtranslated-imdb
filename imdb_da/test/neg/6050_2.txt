OK, so Herc is a hunk ... but the rest of the 3 hours was wasted, wasted ... oh mankind! Bad Sean Astin had to follow his master up the same hills of New Zealand to ... wait! Couldd it be? Someone in Rings Lord's Production Crew was making home movies in his spare time! Yes it is! <br /> <br /> I wish I could say at least that he was promising. <br /> <br /> The special effects were often ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Herc was a hunk. <br /> <br /> NH
