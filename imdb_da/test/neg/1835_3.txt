This movie had such a good premise to start with. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really couldn't figure out who the evil guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many stupid clichés from the worst of the old American slasher / horror movie. Now I love slasher / horror movies, but there are all the old clichés that have long disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old "I hear sounds in the basement and I am at home alone and the basement light does not work, so I go down to investigate" cliché. "Three examples of these cliches have really really annoyed me to no end: <br /> <br /> 1) When Potente finds out that there can be a secret society at work at the medical school that cares for living organs, she continues to ask questions and tell ALL - very publicly, essentially, she says : "I found you out. Come and kill me because I tell all your secrets. "And then she wonders why she finds blood smeared over her bed and brings her roommate cut off a finger in a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after a guy she met two weeks ago ends up in the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society that displaces living people, she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored 2-3 times by HERSELF AT NIGHT to investigate. <br /> <br /> 3) Her roommate is killed, being chased by the killer she knows, does not report to the university or police, leaving school to go home to visit her parents, and then she returns to school, apparently thinking that this guy who was trying to kill her will let bygones be bygones and not try to kill her, even though she knows his secret, of course she was wrong. <br /> <br /> For a person who sk To be so smart (she studied to be a doctor in the best school in Germany), she acted as a cliché of bimbo in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> These things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me want the ending to come even faster. Halfway through the movie I stopped routing for her and wanted her to end the dissection table too.
