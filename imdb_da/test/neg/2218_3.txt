"On Earth's Core" was on television yesterday. I worked on my computer and made an overview and see what should have been some of the worst actions ever made. I was instantly excited by the film's creepy production values, horrific plays (all with Peter Cushing) and horrible, unintentional salutary action sequences and puppet shows. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical Buff hero on a groundbreaking tour of the Welsh landscape. Little do they know that a great evil lurks in the center of the earth's core .... Forget the title does not make sense. (If they really were on the earth's core, they would be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and burning alive in a sea of ​​iron or whatever it is down there.) Forget the puppets used in the "The Beast Master" production competition to Be the funniest look of all the time. No, the real genius of "At Earth's Core" is its naive stupidity - a gung-ho action play without genuine action and without real acting. It's really just a gung-ho movie and a stupid one on it. People who enjoy MST3K-style stuff will love this - it's terribly bad, and it's so bad it's almost funny in a weird way.
