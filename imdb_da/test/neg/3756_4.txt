Of the four main players in here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I've never heard of (at that time) was the one who annoyed the heel out of me and destroyed the movie. Well, she must have done a decent job of getting me to throw her and VHS in the trash. I refer to Kelly in the role of teenage brat, "Tia Russell." Ironically, she played six years later a wonderful and extremely sympathetic role in the person of "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Holland's Opus." Candy is like fun fun to watch as "Buck Russell," or the title character "Uncle Buck." Few actors were better at playing a gracious, rude slob than Candy. I enjoyed his character in here, but I can't see the spoiled teenage girl more than once. Also in the first few minutes of the movie, the little boy says "Miles" (Cauklin) the word "G-damn." How bad is it to have a six-year-old child who says the Lord's name in vain on film? These Hollywood people are such sickos. No wonder many of their children's actors turn out to be mentally turned up, Caulkin is a point in point.
