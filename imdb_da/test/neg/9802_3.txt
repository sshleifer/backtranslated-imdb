When I just finished the book, Mrs said. Dalloway 'by Virginia Woolf, I was thrilled to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. What I encountered, however, is a movie that was boring, incomprehensible, and non-sensual. One cannot completely blame the movie, but tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is Virginia Woolf, it is almost exclusively written in style of conscience with long periods of internalization and little actual dialogue. would definitely think there shouldn't be a movie made of it just because a movie can be made from it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, deserves no fault for the fault of this movie, nor any of the other actors. It is simply a movie that could not be understood from the story that Woolfe wrote, and should not have been tried. Don't watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
