This movie as the 1st KSA's movie should be active for their people and show the good stuff on them. Otherwise, we see in this that Rotana's cast will show the people of religion in Saudi Arabia as a terrorist and stupid in fact their not very peaceful and wise. If the instructor is not even less good. Grandfather in film is much younger than the father, everyone notes it. And the girls who are not Saudi Arabian show our girls as places seeking men to satisfy their needs. Hasham was just another part of the furniture shopping, he did nothing to imagine only when he said to his lover, I love you and shout to his friend, don't talk to strange girls >>>>>>> real fun or really stupid <br /> <br /> His father wasn't so moving just put theirs and he sees this movie as not one of the cast and only words he said "A5zo Al Shai6an". The nice thing in this movie is when the girls were set in the restaurant in the family's part, there is talked behind a young man with his girlfriends "kiss me" many times >>>>> Has this happened in Saudi Arabia, when the girls and boys grow up well and muslim not bitch and fake. Any Saudi has patriot in his heart will not allow to see this silly movie
