In Los Angeles, the alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of non-qualified features just to get enough money to drink and play in horse racing. His primary and only goal is to write and have sex with dirty women. "Factotum" is an uninteresting, pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a few days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble, being fired immediately because of his ruthless behavior. In line with IMDb, this character would be a fictional alter ego of the author Charles Bukowski, and based on this story I will certainly never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, better look at the touching and heartbreaking Hector Babenco's "Ironweed" or Marco Ferreri's "Storie di Ordinaria Follia" based on the same author's life. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum ?? As Destino" ("Factotum ?? Without Destiny")
