I suppose this is an all-out horrible movie would be unfair but it's pretty bad. The Sub-Disney story involves dogs playing football and falling in love (aw, how cute!) The action is not bad, but it can certainly be better, especially the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who looks embarrassed as a whole, as He won't even be there. Anyway, kids will love it, but parents take care!
