If it would have had Jack Black listed as the leading actor, I would instantly stay away from this movie. It does actually make some of his movies look good compared to this movie. This movie should have been filmed as a comic book aged 3-8 and it would have been much better. It's nothing but a bunch of the stupid sketches of other movies put together to make a big mess. The film looks as if it was shot in a day without thoughts at all behind. There are a few times when it may seem like a turning point, and the movie actually has a plot for the movie or at least a story should evolve, but the stupid sketches inserted just ruin the whole movie.
