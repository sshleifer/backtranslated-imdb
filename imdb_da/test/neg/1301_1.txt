This movie was only for two nights running on ITV1 .. dear oh dear. Someone actually bought this at Robert Carlylse's strength. OK, I missed the start. But what I saw was so bad I thought no ... I looked embarrassed at the stars in it. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt there would be progress as they did in this movie. Everything was poor about this movie. OK, cgi .. but no reality. The revaluation gave the impression of a rocker end. I was not impressed. Yes, formula. Couldn't guess the end. From what I saw the military overhand, people who did the heroic things alongside no time to do their thing, just wouldn't have happened that way? It was worse than leaving your brain at the door. It was annoying .. like someone else said .. yes, really .. it would of course have happened ... not !! The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada .. so it was a co production, missing that third party .. I have to check back on this site. I'm not usually this critical, but it annoyed me.
