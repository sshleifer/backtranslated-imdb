Not one of the Monograms is better (don't try to be entertaining here either) Chan entries. Shanghai Cobra has a lot to do for it, but in the end it's just too confusing and messy to be too satisfying. The film opens with a killer named Shanghai Cobra, who has already hit twice, and now it's about in a scene at a dinner in one way or another. We have a guy, a girl and another guy who has an implicit connection when a guy dies in the streets. Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for it really is at the heart of the problems with this movie - it has too much to anticipate without any real, satisfactory explanation. I haven't even gone into the kitchen kitchen that has some dedication and a jukebox that speaks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with it! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then he goes into movies that work for the government and flies out to help a friend. He also has the right to check out a bank's radium store and look for a man wrapped in bandages, which he helped arrest in Shanghai many years earlier. I found the plot very involved as mentioned earlier. Tolerates are back like Chan. He is always gracious. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are also back. Both do good jobs and are very entertaining. But the overdue plot did not convince me, and much of the film was seen with a strange question mark. This is not a bad movie, not just a very interesting one, except the most devoted of Chan fans.
