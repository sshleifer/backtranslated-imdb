Whatever the manufacturer went for, he missed out completely. The Lone Ranger is not a camp, but the "icon" of freight circles all over the world. And it's a total violation of the character's spirit that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearance when this film was released. All the long story In short, the only saving grace of this brutal (and poorly executed) distortion was that in that year I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio as a tour due to the poor press over Mr. Moore's treatment. Needless to say, Mr. Moore's character, integrity and presence have removed the film. <br /> <br /> Some things can't be done better. There is only one Lone Ranger.
