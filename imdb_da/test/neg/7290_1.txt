I wish I could find some good things to say about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) to "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but it would be a very brief comment. The magic that the first had is nowhere to find here.the animation is rather poor everywhere, the signs themselves are not so well-drawn. The backgrounds and foregrounds are also not good. There is very little attention to detail here. And instead of a compelling and engaging story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and do not make much sense. I swear even the signs sounded like they were bored and would rather be somewhere else. As stated, the voters were bored and would be somewhere else at least that's the impression. some of the same actors return to this grim effort, but an integral part of the success of the first was Michael J.Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch. I get the distinctive impression, this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the first success with you very much thoughtfulness or care. but at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of "kida". This is probably the only good thing about this movie, and she doesn't even think she has her heart in it. You could not blame any of the casts for not giving their all, considering what they were to work with. or not work with. This is a straight two video movie (and I use the phrase loosely) that should have gone straight to the nearest landfill. anyway, shame on Disney.consumers deserve much better than this. this one gets a 0/10 and a well deserved one on that.pu
