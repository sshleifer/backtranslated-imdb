First I will give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10! It was no more than a wannabe movie. I felt very disappointed to see this movie. I was led to people, it would be more drama and more facts about the true story on which it is based. Instead, I spent over an hour watching the Middle Ages, breaking the law, and taking drugs. It is abit as a football factory, but without any real story and not a good ending. After watching the movie, I was back and asked, "What was the movie about?" If you like movies without real history and a lot of drugs to take and swear, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of mob and gangster movies, but this movie didn't live up to the hype. I can see where the author tried to go with the movie, but it never reached its destination. One of the worst British movies I've ever seen. If only the movie had more of a story, it would have a bad one excellent movie.
