This movie is Hilarious What is better than seeing two beings beat each other? GIANT cgi versions of these animals as battle! But I demand one of the weapons used in the movie. Because they seem to be using fraud. Count the amount of shots they use before they have to ... Oh wait, that's right, they never have to reload. Whether you're counting the shots ... it's fun. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the movie for Komodo vary from one tiger to an elephant. Oh, and did I forget to mention that these GIANT Komodo dragons apparently are bad as hell? Because somehow, even though the actors look in the direction that the animal comes from, they are surprised when it looks. <br /> <br /> When someone dies, one can tell its coming because they all bring it to what they put their arms up in the air and cross them to save themselves ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The final gem is that these scriptwriters brains are just a gland's full knowledge. With "facts" that both of these beings are amphibious to comment as "helpless animals", they are just full of fun facts.
