As the title suggests, there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this movie: If a man has the talent and seems to find his way to society and money, what can be the result if he is denied it for not having X factor is? This issue was unsatisfactorily addressed in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me pretty cold along the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is the title of Ripley and, apart from blowing on a funded hunt for Europe, falls under the spell of his ordered goal, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoerotism and social insecurity are all intertwined in a fierce conflict that escalated and complicates the rest of the film. Law, Damon and the damn pleasant Paltrow as Dickie's boyfriend are OK. I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman's cameo-ish Freddie Miles, the bluff community friend who Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story is lumpy without bow or redemption, for that matter - which makes it quite difficult to swallow. 4.10
