This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can tell when you see a "wanna be" mafia movie .... and that's it. This made no sense at all, did not start at the beginning of his life, charactors were everywhere ... and the TERM "GODFATHER" did not even exist before PUZO wrote the book! ..... Then, the real mafia borrowed PHRASE and made it to himself after the movie ..... THIS piece of claptrap would have a belief that the phrase (representing mafia don) was used back in the 20s .. When these people were only called "DON" .... outside the original Godfather movie, if you want to see another decent mob flip, check out Puzo's The Last Don (part 1) part 2 suck.
