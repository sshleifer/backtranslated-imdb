While the Aeon Flux was mildly entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a Wednesday night than the pub, I was glad I had bought a get a free ticket. When I didn't know anything about the movie when I walked in, I didn't even know there was an animated series before I read this site, I was ready for something, and as some other viewers noticed, the trailers showed a well-filmed, Good looks, and interesting cinema had pulled me halfway through the movie, although I was a little disappointed, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I also feel that it just lacked that extra depth and left me with the empty feeling. And enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun fighting, if you have to do them, do it with a certain style, not just lots of explosions and creepy guards falling down. Personally, I would rather have seen a little more about the history and the people of the city or learn more about how the president was undermined than yet another long and high pistol fight.
