"The Wizard of Menlo Park" was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007: Although he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, phonograph, movie camera, electric car battery, power grid (possibly His main but least recalled invention), the prefabricated house and innovations for the telephone and telegraph, as well as the ticker tape machine and an early tuner. The total number of patents is over 1,000 - far more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless business competitor. He often had great legal battles over the ranks of his inventions of rivals. The best example is the phone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals claiming against Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's invention here was not the central idea that Bell and Gray were independent of each other in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the telephone receiver and transmitter that Bell did not develop. Nevertheless, it was part of the grand ruling of the Supreme Court in 1888, which was the longest US Supreme Court ruling (a single amount of their reports!) Written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite - who, incidentally, killed the bad Chief Justice from overtime work in weeks in the process of completing it. <br /> <br /> In 1886, Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the power grid for big cities. This was George Westinghouse, inventor of the railway air pause. Westinghouse firm had been assisted by a new inventor, and former Edison assistant, Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "AC", which was a rival system for Edison's "DC". Edison's system was basically a straight line system of electricity. Tesla's system allowed the power to be switched from one circuit to another - in fact, it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival by an advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with power lines. Edison had early set his lines underground so they would not be threatened by the weather. But Westinghouse was forced to get its lines out into the open telephone lines. Since there were several unfortunate deaths from repair managers on Westinghouse lines (especially an incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrible spectators in Manhattan's business district), Edison began to insist that the AC was far more dangerous that DC > <br /> All in all, Edison was helping some subsidiaries get Westinghouse AC generators and alternators for an electric chair. Edison himself always refused to invent the electric chair, but he helped several smaller characters along the way - for the complete story, Mark Essig read EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison is experimenting with cats and dogs (experiments he was happy to show to the public). In the long run, despite assisting the invention in a new embodiment, Edison failed to escape the public support of Alternating Current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903, he was able to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. with his invention of the film camera. He helped "lay down" a well-known public elephant ("Topsy") who had killed several men. He did this by electrocuting the poor animal with A. C. But the whole killing is on film - and one can see it to this day. It's a pitiful looking movie - whatever badly "Topsy" had made it was a poor animal - not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see the explosions of electric sparks that show the elephant's death, we are aware that it is soon over, but the sudden collapse of "Topsy" is still an unpleasant sight to see. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the modern film audience. Still, it is sad to say that it probably gave Edison a profit - his description of the movie in his movie catalog shows real pride in his performance here. In 1903, it may have been exciting entertainment for many Americans to see it. You are glad that more people are being horrified by it today - sometimes you can feel that humanity has improved slightly.
