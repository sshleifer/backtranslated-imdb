Some may go on a movie like this, but I didn't do that for sure. A university professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He basically takes the first child, a bad choice by the name of Adam. As it turns out, Adam doesn't have both veins in the water, which almost immediately causes incredible stress and anxiety for Dr. Norwell. This sob story drolly played out with a problem after another, all centered around Adam's bumps and bouts. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adopted child was never explained. Along the way, the good doctor managed to attract a wife to share in hell, the little one went out. Personally, I think both were a beer that was less than a six pack. Bypass this yawner.
