Like the last two 'Mad Max' films, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is not an exception to the violence and the weird plot. Mad Max is in a post-war community where he has to destroy master blasts and get the kids to "tomorrow morning land". This is generally a combed movie with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane pigs and odd characters. I was very sad to see it all, and it didn't matter to me. I didn't feel inspired after watching this movie; The only decent thing about this movie was the extremely strange characters that were retrieved in various ways throughout the film. It's too strange for me, and it was too boring.
