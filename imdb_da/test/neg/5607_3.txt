Rutger Hower fans Don't be FOOLED - he only plays a como in this movie and that's it. This movie loses an extra point for the scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of approx. 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voice-overs. <br /> <br /> The female manager of this movie is far beyond this bad material in appearance and talent â€” she's great movie is a dog and she's wasted on it. The story is a lawyer who hopes for that partnership one day at the company being suckered into having to guard Boss' niece over land. They have several meetings on the road with different oddballs, and it's the vehicle for a series of sketches, and the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite is thrown into the mix as a sidetrack to good measure. <br /> <br /> This is a road trip where extreme circumstances put our oppressed heroes to the test and he is slowly unleashed at the end of the movie, ah is not loving grand, yadda yadda .. <br /> Just watch this movie if you want to see a hot chick being annoying for a dork in a truck for an hour and a half.
