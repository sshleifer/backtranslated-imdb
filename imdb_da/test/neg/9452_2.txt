A really horrible movie, really low budget, with horrible plays, an outdated and spooky plot, a modest reuse of vampire stories mixed with modern science. The result is a total mess, with no significance for most parts, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like many of the low-budget independent movies of this kind. A waste of time
