I could throw a better movie. This is a waste of time and money. It makes me sick that movies like these are actually made, and the people who make them actually believe they are good. I'm going to like teen comedies when they're done well. However, this movie takes this genre to a new low. With movies like this, people think it's actually okay to do this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it. It's sadism.
