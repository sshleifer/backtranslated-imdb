With so many horrible spoofing films, this is unfortunately a fresh breath to the genre. Compared to classics such as the airplane or the naked gun, this is terrible, but compared to the latest ghost films like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, this is very smart and original. Don't make me wrong, but it wasn't a good movie in any way. I laughed a few times and there are a few inspired gags, but any pop culture reference falls flat on that face, like most jokes in the movie. Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a poor coach in the past, but now he is back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels distant from him, and his daughter dates a football game to believe in her father. Spoofs of various recent films come into play, like many views and nonstop stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie are the gags who don't trust referral to recent movies. Spoofs of Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports films are not fun at least. It is mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs, like a bizarre crushing scene or a chewing tip. These small throw giggles cannot carry the film, and ultimately it is difficult to see. The last 20 minutes are cruel to sit through. <br /> <br /> The characters are surprisingly developed for a sports show movie, but I'm sure the characters were built on clich√©s from the genre. Nevertheless, they are not that bad. David Koechner can draw a leading role in a movie. Too bad they gave him so much curving material to work with. Matthew Lawerence has a fine comedic timing in a not always so comical role as a ballet dance football player with a crusader father. Carl Weathers rounding off the cast, playing again in a sub-sports movie (Not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!) All in all, it's a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's fun, but more often than not, it's just very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and substance humor.
