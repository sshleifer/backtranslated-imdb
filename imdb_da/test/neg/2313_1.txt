I do not recommend watching this movie. It's a movie where a movie is filmed, without the attraction of the actress and the actor being played. The gender scene at the end of the film, which is to explain the actor's reluctance (played in the movie) to collaborate with the actor (played in the movie) in it is a blurry repetition of the same scene in Breillat movie Fat Girl. Everything that was played with more delicacy, if you can associate delicacy with a sex act like that. A typical French expression of the thing that happens in Sex's comedy is Oh la la! In Breillat's film Brief Crossing, there is also sensitivity. In Sex is comedy, I can't see real sensitivity, and also a clear plot for the film does not develop, so there is a fairly loose story with the disillusionment of the end.
