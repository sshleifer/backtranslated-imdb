This is basically just a stupid chase story, almost identical to zillion of other chase stories in action, excitement, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack thereof) and pacing. The one area in which 'The Net' differs from traditional chase films is in its subject matter: Computers. Unfortunately, you have not understood the differences between a calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer novices should not watch this movie because it will make them paranoid over computers. No matter what Hollywood is trying to tell us, simply deleting a person's identity is not that easy. There is still too much paper documentation in the world and there was even more in 1995. <br /> <br /> Computer profiles should not see this movie either. I mean a magic virus that can melt your entire PC when you press "Escape"? Please. And the whole virus, including the cold multimedia effects of your screen that dissolves (what is it about?) Can fit on a single 1.44 mb floppy disk? Yeah ... whatever.
