Don't waste your time and money with this turkey's stink. <br /> <br /> This is an over-the-top melodramatic love story set against New France (aka 18th century aka Quebec). Or is it a historical saga of New France with an epic romance thrown in? I don't know, and at this point I don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story being told out there about the unspoiled French adventurers, rogues and other various characters who settled in Canada and parts of the United States. The characters are assembled clich√©s, the story is blown, breathless and devoid of any charm, and before all that the seer wants to do is get out of the theater, get his head controlled and grab his or her anger by being taken of hype. <br /> <br /> This movie was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since, as a historian and French Canadian or Canadian of French descent (or whatever) I am a) a believer that the story of my people in this country has not yet been told as well as it could on film b) interested in this topic c) a movie lover who thinks cinema these days can wonders with this grandiose and tragic history. <br /> <br /> As I said, don't waste your time with this frustrating bit of claptrap.
