Neither had I read any of the books or seen the first movie, so after I received a preview show, I had no expectations. "Angels and demons" were a confused, insignificant film without direction or credibility. There was very little character development, and I never found myself concerned about the main characters' situation. The reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed, as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati is who they are. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps from place to place with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everyone in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize that this is very unlikely. The Climax is extremely clich√© and leaves you wondering what happened and wondering why no one considered any of these points, it feels very tackled and unnecessary. <Br /> <br /> The actors are not very credible in their roles, mostly because I find it hard to believe that researchers, professors and men in the church would act the way they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible at least, and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule, and I had to question how the protagonists managed to get from place to place to time, every time. /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the movie is cinematography, I found it a beautiful movie to watch, but it was such a mess that I didn't find worth paying to watch theaters.
