Aaran is one of the films where you find the loopholes in Indian cinema. Here's a good example to show how excellent authors, directors, and actors yield to producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, who appears in a film about a real story in Kashmir. The series of the movie is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is really the son of the producer of the film. Therefore, he does not have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so. This kid does not know what works and he is "totally" in the movie. God Help Indian cinema with such producers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pathetic view of what is happening in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of such wonderful writers, actors, and directors who want to share their real life experiences. But the unfortunate part is that a film about the highest ranks in Indian militia turns out to be a pathetic screen that only makes one think that the film was stupid. <br /> <br /> We should practice such producers in the film industry and pave the way for good cinema.
