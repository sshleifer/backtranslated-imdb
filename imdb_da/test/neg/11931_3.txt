Joan Crawford is convincingly disfigured as our story starts, and of course she gets rectified. But she is a bad egg that exploits a guy while living another guy's antisocial philosophy. All this takes place in Sweden, which is really bizarre. It causes everything and memorable in the image, which is freed from depicting Anytown USA, but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake page is burdened and rendered unspecified by the need to Americanize everything. There is plot, plot, plot so chatty that you could drown in it, and making matters worse is a framing unit that adds zilch to the movie. The photography is occasionally beautiful, with odd angles and thumbnails incorporated quite well. But it is flooded without even drawing you.
