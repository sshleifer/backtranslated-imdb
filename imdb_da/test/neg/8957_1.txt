This was a shockingly bad movie and I literally jumped the first time watching the Blue Screen puppets. Imagine the worst Blue Screen special effects you've ever seen, somehow make it worse, and then combine this with poorly crafted rubber and play-doh dolls resembling a semi-retarded preschool art. grade. Then add some screaming, Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, melodic-metal guitar solos stuff that is too loud and lasts too long. The overall movie is horrible and makes "Feeders" look like "Rashomon." Its one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric spiral dismally down, like a waterproof turd in the eternal, slow whirlpool of a broken Rest Stop toilet. Nevertheless, one should not miss a movie like "Actium Maximus" of the bad movie competitors out there, even if you only look at clips on YouTube or somewhere. This movie is a bit of an eye opener if you can stomach the trip. I think this director can be mentally ill, but it is a little offensive. Looking at him, discussing the project, you get the sense that he really thinks he's created something wonderful. I think he's the "Star Wars kid" of gonzo filmmakers. What a mess. :-)
