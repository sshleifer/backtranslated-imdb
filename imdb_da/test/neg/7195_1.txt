This appeared on a DVD that bought a friend for me. They had listed it as "The Savage Guns", which was a completely different movie. Of course, the people who packed the DVD never bothered to look at what they burned on the disc. In any case, this movie is just as bad as it gets. The audio track is a combination of TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western. Lots of galloping around on this music. It seems that the guy has to gallop between scenes to burn up some time and give the soundtrack people something to do. <br /> <br /> English is renamed Italian and it really shows. I wish it had been a little worse, and then it would have had some of Campy's feelings of the Ed Wood movies. As it is, it's just awful.
