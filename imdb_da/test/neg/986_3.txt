The best thing about this movie is the first one in Sicily, I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and film start is wonderfully surprising. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crialese insisted insignificantly on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to melt neo-realistic suggestions and video music techniques, Fellinian surreal memories and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack that brings it all to an end that gives you a sense of an exaggerated long story cut suddenly short. Frankly, this is a real overrated movie, and Crialese is a real overrated director.
