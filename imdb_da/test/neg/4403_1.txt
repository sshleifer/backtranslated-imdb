A Brazilian cable TV presents "Yadon Ilaheyya" this month in its "Cult" channel. I saw the trailer and listened to the ad and decided to watch this movie. In fact, it is an absurdly boring pretentious, stupid, meaningless, interrupted crap about the conflict in the Middle East, and along with "Soultangler" they are certainly the worst movies I've tried to see. I really wasted forty and thirty minutes of my life and looked at the first half of this crap, very indicated for torturing enemies. How can this film be awarded and nominated for awards including in Cannes? My voice is a (terrible) one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
