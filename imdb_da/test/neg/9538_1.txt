OK - tell me some college in Southern California has a movie to make class. And some dudes were enrolled just to shoot girls and they gave them a camera. And then they were full / stony / or just stupid stupid to actually use a camera, and they made it into their class. AND FAILED. <br /> <br /> That's my only explanation for this, this thing. Good God, they left the date and time counting on some of it. The picture started in a new stage way before the sound, and forget a plot. Well, apparently there was one and they had to tell everything about it when the 3 hour introductory sequence was finished. But I'm glad they did, because I would never have gotten it by seeing it here. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS.
