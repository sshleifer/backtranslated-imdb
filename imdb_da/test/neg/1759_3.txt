I found the first 90 minutes of this movie to be very interesting, although a few parts of it were ridiculous (ie Philip Seymour Hoffman's character). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant and I began to lose interest in the movie. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-acted and I can see why Rene Zellweger won an Oscar since she was so interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional. But I found the message to be a bad one: not surprisingly these days in Hollywood. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) deserts the Confederate army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He also becomes disillusioned with war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat surrendered the army in the two world wars?) But of course, all this film is perfectly acceptable. So again, what liberal filmmaker has ever had a good thing to say about the US military ?? To add to their left wing, they distinguish a vigilante-like pose for deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. Well in the film world that we know: well portrayed so badly and badly is good ..... and only liberals would imagine deserting as heroes.
