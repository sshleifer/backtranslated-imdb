Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I once again wondered why replay a good movie? This version lacked excitement and passion for Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck had this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones had found another one she could own (she has other roles she owns.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but happy Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionate in comparison. This version was comfortable but bland. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting bit of color that did not seem important. I liked it when at the end he said he would be back, but the movie was over before returning. I mostly have Martha at home. Now and then I take it back.
