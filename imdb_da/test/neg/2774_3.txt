This is a cheap watching movie! A stripper is being attacked and raped by zombies, and no one believes in her. She goes to the police, who also rape her. She finally finds a child who was also attacked by the zombies, and they trace the zombies back to 'The Zombie Master'. That Stephanie Beaton stars as a stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
