Wow, this episode started on a STOOOOOPID premise! The company chugging together when, suddenly, Abraham Lincoln floats around the room and welcomes Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me or is this a really boring idea? Lincoln comes aboard, and they welcome them. Abe suggests that they radiate down to a barren planet where they meet other famous dead people - both good and evil. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has brought together a team of good and evil people to fight for supremacy. It all seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the good side is saddled with Surak - a Vulcan that makes Gandhi seem like Rambo !! Despite a horrible premise, the action is pretty good, and it is great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this wrestling match. But don't miss this for high art or deep sci-fi. The bottom is that the series was on its last legs as a first round series, and it looked like they were dusting off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
