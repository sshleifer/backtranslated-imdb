Pretty bad. This movie about a grizzled (and sincere rock silly) old prospector and his dog Shep 'ie. Lassie, as well as an annoying child whose name I can't remember at the moment. At the beginning of the film, the old prospector DELIBERATELY has buried itself in some sand, so the poor dog has to dig him out. Why? Did he hate the dog? Anyhoo, somehow, this idiot has managed to beat gold and go to tell his partner. But the man is dead, and his sleazy other partner helps Jonathan grab the gold. The geezer is trying to leave his dog with the son of the dead guy, but not even the retarded boy wants to stay with this kid. There is quaint old sermon (for quaint reading smelly) and the oily guy ended the old guy (surprise, surprise) and trying to steal all the gold. Plus he poisons the dog and also tries to kill the child. So I guess it's okay that a devil and crazy Lassie..r ... SHEP does this guy at the end, even though it's pretty disturbing in what is really a children's movie. There are extremely stereotypical (to the point of racial slur) 'native Americans' who speak without using verbs (as in I do battle fire type speech). And that's pretty much the scale of the cast, because apparently, Lassie's salary was too large to hire others. Kind of boring. not very interesting, and a bit too dark. Not a good movie in any way.
