It looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, right? And a $ 42 million hoist - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie. <br /> <br /> Big Disappointment - I expect the stars got all the money, because the production values ​​on this are miserable. <br /> <br /> But more than that, the pseudo reservoir dog's atmosphere when the light crime goes wrong. It is very made for TV stuff. <br /> <br /> All in all, tremendously disappointing - it scores points to be what it is - but loses them massively to be absolutely not very interesting ...
