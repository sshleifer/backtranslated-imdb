I was pleasantly pleased with the end. I just watched this movie yesterday and had to turn it off but changed me. It was not at all the direction I thought the story would end. That's about all the positive I can say about this movie. All the actors are nobodys, especially the leader. While she is an attractive young woman, she will never make it big. Writing, direction and acting are wooded, just like what you would see on daytime laps. The recording sites were very wise in making you believe it could be anywhere, rather than blatantly tipping it in Canada. When shot entirely in Canada, I suppose the whole party was Canadien, which is not quite bad, as some recent Canadien TV productions: "Cold Squad", "Stone; Underover" are quite well done.
