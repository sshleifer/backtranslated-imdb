Eugene O'Neill is praised by some as America's leading playwright, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was an experiment, he concocted, where the characters on stage look to the audience and say what they really think and then resume conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a dinner break on Broadway, so you can probably assume that many have been sacrificed here. <br /> <br /> The screen uses voice over the minds of all the characters. It is probably a technique that is better suited to the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did really well with him in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than O'Neill gave his players in this case. Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. Are much more animated in most of their movies than they are in strange interlude. The story takes place over a 20-year period. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intention is killed in World War I. She starts to play a great deal, though that part is not shown in this version. She acquainted with Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has a perennial, Ralph Morgan, a friend of his father's Henry B. Walthall. <br /> <br /> She marries Kirkland, but is then warned by her mother, May Robson, and shows that the gallops of the family in that family cite another literary work. Since Kirkland wants children and Shearer and Robson think Kirkland's train will slip the track if he doesn't get one, Gable gets recruited for breeding purposes. Of course, you can see all the complications it can cause and O'Neill explores them all. Gable is so terribly disappointed in an O'Neill production, but he was an up and coming player at the MGM and did what they told him. Shearer does what she can to lift a very boring story, but she seems to be defeated at first. Best in the movie is possibly Robson, who puts a real bite in her dialogue. Strange Interlude ran for 426 showings on Broadway in 1928-1929 and star Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in Gable and Shearer parts. Perhaps no one could really have saved the movie because two years earlier, Groucho Marx managed to stuff it into Animal Crackers. After seeing what he did, I don't think the movie comes publicly, took it too seriously. <br /> <br /> And since it's not the best of O'Neill, I couldn't.
