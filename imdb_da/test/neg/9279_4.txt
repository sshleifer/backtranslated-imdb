This movie is a window on Britain's world in 1973 - a world of vacation camps, fags and birds. I was actually at Pontins Prestatyn while this was filmed, so it's fascinating to see where I vacationed as a child and what the world we've left behind. "Plot", as it is, relates to Stan and Jack's attempts to change jobs at a holiday camp (25 a week!) For a chance to chase young women and settle Blakey. They are joined by the rest of Stan's family, and some laughs must be heard from Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive's (Anna Karen) persistent chuntering, as well as Blakey's sheer appearance, but the idea that young women would see something desirable in brilliant Stan (Reg Varney) or lecherous Jack (Bob Grant) is just risible. Not safe enough in his time, now it's just a curiosity from a bygone age.
