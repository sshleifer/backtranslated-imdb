I was an extra on this movie, in the debut at the airport for the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fugitive (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees who ran across runways at Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point we were walking around in our turbans as we waited for another shot, one of my fellow extras turned me over to what they should turn to. I told him it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just as a musical. There was a long break, then he replied, "Man, this movie is going to suck". Exactly remarkable of him, I thought. I was fine and made a little money, but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie, I can't get through it all. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the movie "The Swarm", you can basically get the idea. You will see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an idea that on that side is just bad. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money on a movie and hire enough big names, then a good story and good writing is not necessary. Just turn the big crank and the product comes out. It's just not worth seeing.
