I've seen Milos Forman's movie since I saw "One Flew Over the Guck Nest" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair", I wondered if it was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. Okay, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it looks like a bunch of drug people are dancing around (wait a minute ... that's really it!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part where Milo's talent turns out, is the last 15 minutes or so (SPOILER !!) when Berger takes Claude as a soldier set to the Vietnam War. The 15 minutes move and run, but it is a shame that we have to endure as much terrible material before it. Well, maybe it's one of the movies you need to be "on topic" to enjoy (the subject is marijuana, acid and other substances that the film glorifies). I'm not, so ...
