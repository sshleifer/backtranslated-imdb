This is officially the horrible, boring, corny and ridiculous movie ever created. The film is about a crazy child and his friends, and they land a 747. His dreams are very corny and do not make any sense and are very poorly done. Every special effect looks like it was finished without any modern technology, and it could have been created by the child playing the "leading role" in the movie. If you see this movie, it will definitely make you stupid. I advise you never to consider watching this movie and if you do, good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off. My comment doesn't even understand the horrible creation from hell that has been made. The person who wrote the comment in front of me did not see the same movie that I was terribly watching, and I wish I never looked at it. Peace.
