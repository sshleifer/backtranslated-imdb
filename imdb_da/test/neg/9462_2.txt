** Spoiler * It gives away the very irrelevant ending ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie there was a brief introduction to Gore's world of gore movie master H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gorefilm was measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 gallon, 10,000 maniacs was a 5 gallon. But then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15 gallon. I would like to know where half of the 15 gallons went. In the film I saw very little near 15 gallons. Approved, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but no where near 15 gallons. Some of the dismemberment scenes were certainly pretty gory and realistic, meat strings and all but I wouldn't say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Sounds familiar? You should have said close to the last half of this movie. After the Igor sign was thrown into the acid bath, the film lowered to a painful crawl. There was no coherent end as it did not fit into the 90 minutes before it did. She drove into a van with a total stranger, BIG DEAL! That's what happens when you hold an individual (I don't want to say a person because she doesn't qualify as a person) very innocent of the world around her. The doctor teaches the girl that a man should be loved so that anyone she meets loves her. <br /> <br /> Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we might not like the actor, governance or even Gore ... I want to go with choices A and B. WAS AWFUL !! It was enough to give me bad dreams about cut editing and people with sharp eyes when talking to a person. But I made it through the movie and came out stronger. Too bad I could not say the same thing after the end of ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> This was a bad movie. I can usually take my doses of vinegar in good combat, but each time you get a movie that bites back. I think this movie took an arm or a leg off (haha ... * sigh). Granted, I enjoy the stare scenes where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes wide and just stared. It was very similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast as he stared at that lady in his catering shop and didn't use his power after that. I suppose this movie picks up where Fuad's powers left off. <br /> <br /> * Final judgment * The movie should have been lost. Good day <br /> <br /> -Scott
