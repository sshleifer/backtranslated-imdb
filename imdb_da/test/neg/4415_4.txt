There are a number of movies that my high school friends and I used to joke about. They are mostly the campy works of the 50s that appeared on the television at the late show. This was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native is made alive in a tree stump with a skin on the face. Now, my friends claimed that if you looked carefully, you could see that things had shoes. I've never seen this. What is most striking to me is that the natives seemed to be white men with black fat paint on their faces; some so kind of italian. They also spoke with the weirdest timbre who didn't seem to care for their situation. Like the mummy films, it did not seem that the mobility of the case constituted a major threat. In a confrontation you only have to go fast; I think that's the old surprise element. If you see this, don't take it too seriously. Please be glad we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us such joy.
