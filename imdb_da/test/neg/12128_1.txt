Maybe I was young when I saw it. Maybe I haven't grown up with fat and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I couldn't get it. I get "black" comedy (Black Adder, etc.). I get irony and spoofs. However, I don't get it here. <br /> <br /> I made it a task to figure out the name of this movie (get help from people on the usenet and the most outstanding IMDb Message Boards) so it could be my first 1 point. Terrible!
