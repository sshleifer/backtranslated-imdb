TDY is probably the only worst piece of waste ever to hit it just for video selection. They take a scene from The Order with Jean Claude Van Damme and it attacks me because Van Damme is a personal favorite for B movie comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past, but he has fallen very low in my books, and he will probably never pull someone underneath or feel dead until he has a very good brainworm with himself. <br /> <br /> It also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts, as he did in previous films. In conclusion of all this, if you are ready to watch a movie that fits a trash or woodchipper, renting today you die.
