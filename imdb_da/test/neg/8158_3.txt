I was expecting to see a more feature film of movies, but it probably only turned out to be a poorly low low budget action girl who just didn't have the talent for it. The story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas) whose girlfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) is working for a secret agency, and he has invented a motorcycle that is bulletproof and can shoot lasers and rockets and has a helmet. who can shoot lasers as well. The head of the agency Bosarian (Martin Landau) has made a $ 5 million deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bike. A tall blond thug named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick, but Teri survives. While she discovers she's a videotape that Rick left, he describes his invention that helps Teri with what to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is being chased by several agents, and she gets caught and tortured, but doesn't talk about where a piece of motorcycle needed but she gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick), where they end up using the motorcycle for a bloody shooting. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Fred Olen Ray, who has made his career out of making ultra-low budget film, but he made a serious mistake here by omitting the exploit and trying to make an action movie. Apart from a quick shower scene at first, there is no nudity and the usual titulation that the viewers are used to seeing in a Ray movie is not where to find. I don't think anyone expected Thomas to be naked, but she didn't wear a sexy outfit. Not that it stopped me from pulling her in the tight jeans and admiring her almost perfect shape, but Ray really blew it in this case. Like all his films, the cast is fun to watch and many famous faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after this was made and it is his last play and the film is dedicated to him. You should wonder why Landau would waste him time with such unwanted as this, but I was interested in throwing Combs into a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas good at this movie? So what! I think she showed she could have become a popular "B" movie star if she wanted to, but it never happened. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort even though it's fun to watch, but he released the elements that make him an enjoyable movie maker.
