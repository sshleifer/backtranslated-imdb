I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I watched this movie. The first 1 hour was OK although it made me wonder why everything was centered in Chicago and why no one reported weather disturbances from outside the US. Isolated natural acts (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But in addition to the first 60 minutes, the film just goes on like an endless story. The play is terrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only those people who are employed to panic are adhering to their roles. But I agree that this movie has got some good "special effects". If you rented it on a DVD and would like to watch the movie, despite the reviews, then play it with maximum speed that your player will allow!
