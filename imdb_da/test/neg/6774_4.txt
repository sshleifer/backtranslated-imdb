Fortunately, a short mystery about a telephone operator discovered to be kidnapped daughter of a railway tycoon. The discovery gives an attempt at her life, which is filled with Charlie Ruggles as a "crime deflector". Things take a trip to the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title citation, and another attempt is made on the girls' lives. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your tolerance for Rugggles and his nonsense. I usually think about Ruggles, but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way. In fact, I don't think the mystery didn't help very well, so there was nothing beyond the signs to keep you in mind. yes the final on the train was exciting, but it didn't matter for everything that went before. Not worth searching out, but if you stumble over it, try it.
