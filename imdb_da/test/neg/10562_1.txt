I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I heard about it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis, I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and bright cartoons and made it boring. Each character appears to have been treated as a single facial expression, a single tone on which they base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word written by Jane Austen, they seem to have been passed on to characters in a random way. Although it was made as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel so rushed as if it had been done as a movie this week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett too hard, Mrs. Bennet just a chattering, Mr. Darcy as lifeless as a nut bud, the Bennett girls almost inseparable and Mr. Wickham a man that no one would see twice - hardly the appealing cad! I'm completely out!
