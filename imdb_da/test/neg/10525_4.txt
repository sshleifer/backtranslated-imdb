What I wouldn't do to give this movie a rewrite. Extremely disappointing because of the great beginning, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates in a mess of superstitious bulls after the halfway point and ends with a note so ridiculous, mushy and melodramatic that I couldn't believe I saw the same movie I started with. The film had many elements in its favor, such as. Chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga so tangible, I thought the screen would start to spark, a great soundtrack and beautiful places. Instead of joining the heavy devoted religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have focused on being a creepy road movie with perhaps some undertones of fate and superstition vs logic permeated. I understand the director's full intention of the movie was to make it religion, but the fact is that it just didn't work and he threw so many good things from the beginning by doing so.
