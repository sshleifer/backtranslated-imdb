The days of heaven are one of the most painfully boring and meaningless movies I have ever seen. In no way, form or form would I recommend to anyone ... unless you try to put your children to sleep or ban God, give someone an aneurysm. If I could come back in time and do one thing, I would fire the wheels before they were sent to theaters. Why? The days of heaven are light but extremely vague. Long sequences without dialogue create much of the movie. The characters are too low and ridiculously stupid to relate to. The highlight of history does not touch you: at this point your brain has worked so hard to find out the plot and range of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. The only thing that works is your eyes, and unfortunately your ears, who will listen to the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story who speaks like a man. I'm now stupid to watch this movie. Do not let this happen to you.
