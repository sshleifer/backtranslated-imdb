Jumpin 'Butterballs, this movie stinks! It's a boring and listless feature that never lets up. It's weird that someone even embarrassed Groucho in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache, as he has nothing witty or scandalous to do or say throughout this bore. Chico must have been so uninteresting that he forgot to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo gives a laugh or two and there is a little bit of walking around here anyway. Figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another unpleasant co-comic in Frank Albertson and the road becomes even bumpier. <br /> <br /> A real misfire.
