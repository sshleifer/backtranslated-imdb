The best scene for "The People Across the Lake" is the real scary, nightly opening with a house, a murder and a lake. Then it is almost completely downhill as far as the horror is concerned. A family (mother, father, sister and younger brother) is tired of the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia, and decides to stay and live close to the titular lake. From then on, the film has too much lame joyful family-related doo-doo near the lake, with occasional bodies leaping up here and there. The few scenes where they discover the bodies are quite convincing (in terms of fragility), but they are in stark contrast to the rest of the goings-on (with just the everyday life of the family). The truth to the cases (the mystery of who kills) is learned prematurely, as only the family becomes ignorant and the viewer walks during the unexciting finale (with a discovery in a cellar and runs around the house), as if this made-for- TV stuff suddenly remembered it should be a horror movie. It's not really badly done; the content and history are just not interesting enough. The only highlight in the casting is Barry Corbin, although his performance / character is just a bit too foggy to be taken seriously. Blonde cutie Tammy Lauren (daughter) can also be a recognizable face to avid horror junkies as she also starred in "Wishmaster" (1997) and television shows such as "I Saw What You Did" (1988) & "The Stepford Children" (1987 ). However, she does not have much to do in this movie. Can be skipped but watched if anything.
