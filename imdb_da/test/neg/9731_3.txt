let me say the first thing i did not go into expecting much and seeing it on prime time on opening the night should have helped. I think it would have been if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It sucked so hard. The actor was at best robot and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I think it was their way of twisting the plot; keep everyone in the dark at crucial info to understand the direction of the movie until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot. <br /> <br /> Until the end of the movie: -What Eff is a darkening? CG was cool, but I will understand! - Why can't forces be required? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. Why is willing away so bad? your just normal after, right? - who fresh? <br /> <br /> About 50% of the minutes with just men on the screen, were shots of them in wife beaters, annoying t's and then a intestinal pool scene of all teenage men in the skimpiest make riding speedos knowing that ever has been manufactured. I swear you could see the start of one guy .... yes it was close to soft-core. And of course there was a shower scene and mixing it up was that of DUDES. Row cracks were plentiful, a sausage party started. But there was a single girl shower scene where nothing was seen and she ambles around the best dorm room for about 12 minutes. Then there was a girl talking PJ party. The other thing I couldn't get over was the amount of driving that Caleb did in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. It was a Ford advertisement for about 1/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> Can't see it. Or watch it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. so it might be worth it. but don't expect anything breathtaking.
