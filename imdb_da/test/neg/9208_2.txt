This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers whose waste could ruin movie bands these days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and in her pre-enhancement surgery she really had to be dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us he has gone on much better things since this ... this ... this ... hi, piece of waste. Unfortunately, all their big players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted, but deserves a brave admiration. I think something that is not worth doing is not worth doing well. But he did well anyway. <br /> <br /> There was still a bright shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is mentioned all the way down the credit list, just stole everything. Liotta was wonderfully fascinating! Hypnotic! Enthralling. <br /> <br /> I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason my friend loved it. I think that's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and honestly, she shouldn't have), even though he tried to claim it was other, more artistic reasons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought then, after his first scene, that Ray Liotta would be a great star, or at least a great, highly respected actor. Despite the fragile aspects of the fragile script, the sheer cruelty of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth looking at. In fact, it is worth seeing once to see just how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean for one thing, his name is now usually listed at or near the top. <br /> <br /> Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta beamed like a diamond. <br /> <br /> Only if you see this trash can be prepared to hold your nose. Each protagonist is either amoral or immoral. Horrible movie. Horrible movie idea. <br/> <br /> Added comment: For many people, "Was this comment helpful?" with a no, because they disagree with the expressed opinion. Perhaps IMDb should ask the question instead: "Do you agree with these statements?"
