I bought this movie for a few dollars at a "Clearance warehouse sale" one day, just looking around. The deck looked good (in color) but the movie is B & W (I wish they wouldn't try to trap us with colored covers on B&W movies, but it's a common thing to watch out for!). <Br /> <br /> When I looked at it, I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was a B&W, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, "Invaders from Mars", which has crappy effects, and it's great to see John Banner in something other than Hogans Heroes . Overall, this movie is not so bad for a B-class and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view. It's not my favorite sci-fi, but it's not my worst either. It is OK.
