Seems that some of the previous reviewers have seen a movie other than what I saw earlier this evening ... In fact, this movie is the reason why I am registered on IMDb. Surely Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and for that I give this movie a 2, but the rest of this movie is just plain crap ... The play is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. Sure the actors are in good physical shape, but they can't act! Sometimes I enjoy watching evil movies laughing, but this movie had no charm, and after I saw this movie I was filled with regret to see it. Sure, if you want to see mediocre battles without anything else, then this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for misspellings ... I'm just tired of causing this movie!
