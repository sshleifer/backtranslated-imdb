The movie begins with much voice-over, a bad sign. Then it just slides downhill with stupid and intelligence-abusive scenes involving staircases and Indians. But it reaches new and impressive downs, when all the bright mountain men's dances dance with each other in a high alpine meadow. Meanwhile, the lucky-lucky Indians sit around and see them. It's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "Blazing Saddles". There is a minor error in this comparison; "All over Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
