This is a weak collision of almost everything: refugees, relations between Croatia and Slovenia, globalization, sexual orientation. A very big lumpy metaphor about Slovenia is across the road between its past, symbolized by everything that "virgin" becomes the queen of the household and its future, symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being lesbian and never having children. It plays on a fairly recent Slovenian legend with a virgin and a "forest king" in the form of a goat (Zlatorog Beers imagery is also based on this legend), but unfortunately the treatment is very incoherent. Weiss seems to think that the end justifies the means: she can use all sorts of "dreamlike" sequences, then select and choose which true and which are imaginary. How can the trip in the jeep with the "forest king" be right for all three girls, but the scene outside the tent is only genuine in Simon's imaginary? The end just pulls on and off (I can't believe the movie's runtime is only 98 minutes, have I seen a director's clip without knowing it?), With the three girls looking at the camera for about. 10 seconds while looking scared and happy at the same time (so blatantly). I never thought I could look bad in a movie whose language I didn't understand, but it didn't take long to see that "Simona" is overpowering most of the time as if she were playing in a silent movie. It wasn't as bad as I continued to think the director had just started and wanted to catch what she thought her generation was about film by making a half-experimental movie until I realized that the director was actually 37 years old when he made the movie and that her work is probably "serious".
