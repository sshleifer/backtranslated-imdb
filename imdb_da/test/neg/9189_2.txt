First of all, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in a kind of para-fire fighting unit (those guys who are called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real experience. <br /> <br /> Still, there are some points you notice as incredible. I can understand that they removed the mask's mouth / nose and that there is not enough smoke because the public would otherwise see something. But some things speak logic: <br /> <br /> - No other mask attached to the oxygen. How the hell will you save people through the smoke without one? <br /> <br /> - Repelling people. No, it's not done like that. I would also scream if someone hitched a rope around me that way and hung me from a building. If I could scream it is, and not pass out of the air's will, because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time, when they are abseiling Jack, is better, but still strange. <br /> <br /> - "Go High". No, you do not. You always fight fire from as low as possible. You do not struggle to spray flames, you want to extinguish the fire and it is under the flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They run around like chicken. And they always shout, instead of using radio and keeping discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You can still be separated, but it requires much more than if everyone just scurries around alone to seek victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really go into buildings without bringing water? In Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without it. <br /> <br /> - Firemen on the roof. WTF do they think they do that without safety lines or water? - exploding rooms Wood and brick do not suddenly explode. <br /> <br /> The better points are actually camaraderie and the other non-fire fighting parts of the movie. It's very kitsch, but it's okay. I will give it a point for this.
