Or at least compelling retirement! This movie is horrible, terrible, terrible, rank, rat, boring ... well, you get the idea. Under no circumstances see this piece of waste waste unless you have a death desire because it is safe to kill you. (I only survived because I missed the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor. I can't believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money. It just shows that some people have no scruples if they think they can make a buck or two (literally ... I can't imagine it did more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And, thank you, tell me what possible motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (half a decent actress, certainly over this at least) had to sign on this steaming pile of fertilizer. Was she bored during the 3.5 second dry spelling between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or did she owe a kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the planet's surface (aka carrot's top)? <br /> <br /> I give this a 2/10 and that's probably too high. I try to save my '1s for movies that make me throw up, and since I didn't see all this, my stomach content happily contained. I don't think I'll see it again to find out if it's really worth 1!
