Okay, I can sit through almost any movie, and I tend to get a real kick out of Sci Fi Originals, but there was a big mistake in this movie that turned me off for half an hour in it. <Br /> <br /> Having earned in the US Army, there are some expectations in a movie, including the military. At least, it is necessary to pay attention to proper military rank, uniform and terminology if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters that had a rank facing the wrong direction on the lapel, and later in the movie the time was set as 11:00 hours, but it was full dark outside. Although the manuscript was perfectly executed and the dialogue spectacular and the acting Oscar-worthy, if the people who make the film do not care enough about the film to even bother to find the right way to show military time, why should anyone bother trying to see it?
