An interesting concept turned into a bloodbath ... My first viewing function from Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), when I first became interested in it, at that time seemed an interesting concept ... <br /> <br /> Shakespere + Aussie Movie + Gothic setting + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that turned into a disastrous piece of Aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name ... <br /> <br /> Benefits: -interesting concept <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: -Down to a good casting -Filled and stupid plot -Hooked camera angles -Not many places -Quick use of Shakespearian diolog <br /> <br /> Overall: Australia's worst try a Shakespea movie, stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: That movie is dangerous)
