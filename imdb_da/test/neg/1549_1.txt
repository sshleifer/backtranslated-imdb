For a while it seemed that this show was on 24/7. Then there seemed to be another season or some sort of continuation of this horrible show about the two most stupid and astonished people who have ever been filmed. All the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish, haggling, airheads perfectly. Not much less can be said of them beyond what everyone else has said. I doubt the two ladies have souls, and more than likely they have made some kind of Faustian Bargain to get their lizardly snouts on a television series. Perhaps fates protect humanity from any more exposure to the terrible girls!
