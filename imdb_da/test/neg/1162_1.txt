I got this fifty-one movie out of business sales. I want my fifty cents back. Bad play, bad script writing, miserable direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the movie is horrible. It is not the subject that offends. I am one of the many who find exciting film and true crime film very interesting. The subject could have been treated more seriously with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect for the victims and their broken friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone. There is also little or no attention to what could have caused anyone to begin the bizarre behavior that Ed Gein exhibited in exposing these terrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save your time and sanity. Don't see this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. It's not a total waste though ... you can throw the disk and make use of the plastic housing!
