Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a beautifully thin plot - essentially the death of their queen mother two sisters, an evil and a good, fighting for control of the throne. The good sister gets beaten so she escapes to Earth, where she sees buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt competition. The rest of the movie is largely a long hunting scene as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a kindhearted DJ, and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister's ignorance of Earth's customs and culture. The older sister catches up to her younger siblings several times, but the latter manages to escape and flee again. Throughout this action, there is a cult of women on the home planet who has some sort of age-slack to bring back the good sister. Unfortunately, much of this movie seems to be pretty boring when it comes to Los Angeles (and what was the sound effect of the police car?) The movie culminates in another physical battle between the sisters with a predictable ending. <br /> <br /> It seems like borrowing elements from Star Wars (light the saber and the look of the girls' home plane in the opening and subsequent scenes), Dr. Who (phone box as a means of transport) and some of the costumes (from the cult at home) could have been taken from Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Ms. Dana Fredsti (the evil sister in the movie) in another user commentary mentioned "the endless (and boring) wet T-shirt competition. It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt competition in cinema history. And the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cotton-polyester t-shirts that believed everything to get them wet and translucent. "I couldn't specify it better. The only thing I want to add is that the music in this scene is just rather annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the play is just over the top, but it seems to fit the whole movie's style. The actors who played Vinnie and Vito were just too much for me - I just found them annoying. Mrs Fredsti (Curette) seemed to enjoy herself and did not take too seriously as opposed to Sharon Lee Jones, who acted properly, but seemed to take everything more seriously. All the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots, presumably adding cartoon help, which is a bit unnecessary, as the whole movie was pretty comical. <br /> <br /> From an assessment perspective, this movie had a lot of ugly language; some topless women and others dressed in pliers, but not enough skin to satisfy those looking for nudity; a sex scene portrayed in a non-graphical art dreamlike way; and a little violence - while there were threats of violence everywhere, the scenes of both the sword and brawling were exaggerated, and also the camp was "offensive", even though it seemed that the actors had fun with it. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder who came up with the sign name? Ovule (a small egg), Curette (a surgical instrument for scraping and cleansing), Exzema (suspiciously resembling a disease characterized by scaly skin and itching), Bulemia (an eating disorder with binging and cleansing) and Rickettsia (another disease)? <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a bad, low budget, campy, sci-fi action movie, but it kept me entertained even though I might need a few drinks before I see it again.
