The filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once showed a light, sardonic touch with disgusting material such as "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", is completely down here. Not only is his direction unfortunate, he also adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are terrible. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed by the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the landscape, is a hot-under-the-collar policeman (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to show any life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about experiencing a bums script. Among them, chopped and produced on the cheap. No stars from ****
