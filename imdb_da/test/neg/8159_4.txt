This movie contains a pretty decent FX sequence of an earthquake in 1936. The reason you haven't seen it is because the audience in the 30s was enamored by the "Jeanette MacDonald image" in which the eponymous star fought through countless songs while plots came to a complete standstill. FX crosses the time very well. MacDonald's songs do not, and the unpleasant insertion of the songs to show her only typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The main unit of two friends who grow up to become a priest and a hoodlum, is given another run through machinery (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). In 30 minutes, you've already heard the song 'San Francisco' three times. Thirteen entertainment is generally an accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel from the decade pretends annoyance to the degree shown in San Francisco, Dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Quiet on the West Front, Les Miserables, etc.
