With its entire technical flash, the 1993 "Stalingrad" movie is very disappointing. Before I had seen it, I had read non-fiction accounts in the Stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentaries and photographs of the current battle and its participants. I don't think any movie can really succeed in portraying the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but I would still see what a relatively new German film production would be. While there are a few good elements in this movie, it is generally a mistake. For me, the worst aspect is that it contains significant anachronisms, and also some very clever and cliché elements, most sharply in some meetings between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also some ideological elements in the film that result in very distorted perceptions, including what is similar to a German chapel's caricature, some overwhelmed class war messages, and problematic depictions of "good" versus "bad" Germans. Some German armed forces settled in World War II included men who could maintain some decency through the war and others who did very bad things, but the attempts of the film to show this contrast are very simple and childish. I give "Stalingrad" credit in the sense that it does not fully depict German troops in the simple demonic quality, which is the stereotype that many people now have, but in the film also includes stereotypes as an almost too good-to-be- true infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990s than the 1940s, and two completely evil infantrymen and a back-echelon officer. <br /> <br /> Some recent films like "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" are often praised for their "authenticity" in portraying graphic scenes in combat, but the same films are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of attitudes, values ​​and behavior of 1940s soldiers and civilians. "Stalingrad" and "S.P.R" have large and small characters lacking the unconscious stoicism common to ordinary people in World War II. Surely soldiers throughout history have been infamous for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism, but the self-absorbed, talky, and touchy characters in both of these films are different and much more prevalent in our world today than they were in the 1940s. While many people today want to deny war movies from the 40s and 50s, which present several patriotic messages and are not so graphic about combat, many of the earlier films like "Battleground" are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers attitudes, and they are often successful in showing the terrible effects of war in more indirect ways. A well done part of "Stalingrad" is a battle between German infantry and Soviet thought, which makes a reasonable job of catching some of the horror and confusion in such a fight. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a bad job of showing the common look of the prominent soldier. Part of this may be due to the difficulty of finding thin, scary extras in our pampered and well-fed America and Western Europe today. Also, for many of the German troops in the film, their uniforms and equipment do not carry properly and do not show the professional stock that was common in the German Wehrmacht, even in German defeat years. If you want to get a good idea of ​​how the actual German troops looked, I recommend the following documentaries containing recordings of the Stalingrad campaign: "The World in War", "The War of the Century" and "Russia's War." Also the books "Operation Barbarossa in Photographs" by Paul Carell, "Stalingrad" by Geoffrey Jukes and "Stalingrad" by Paul Carell contain many good pictures. Books written on the battle of Antony Beevor and William Craig are also recommended, and the latter are particularly fond of the common soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films, which, in my opinion, are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" in depicting attitudes and personalities during World War II, and the general feelings, looks, horror and grininess of The war is "Der Untergang" ("The Downfall") and "Talvisota" ("Winter War"). While "A bridge for the long" and "The longest day" cover events on the west front rather than the east, they are also excellent war movies and stay very close to factual accounts. The latter two films lack some of the gravel that is more prevalent in recent films, but they compensate for the lack of other forces, including truth.
