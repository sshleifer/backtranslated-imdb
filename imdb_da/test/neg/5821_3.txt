I watched this movie at our crossroads movie festival, and looked forward to it because it was filmed in Mississippi and star Karen Black. I was severely disappointed by the clumsy script that never flowed and the apparent lack of actors and director's efforts to understand something about the culture they were trying to portray. How did lee and griffin become so deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two was the *** girl under the tree? It was unclear. And there seems to be no law in Hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything distant approaching the daily sounds of the south. Despite the horrible, "it must be how they sound, just soften the" r "method of dialogue, so many times the actors go out of it, Aleksa sounded especially like a new york street under" emotional "scenes, Walt Goggins' character should have been from Morgan City, Louisiana did not sound like the city's mix of New Orleans and Cajun accents, the second annoying point seemed to be a call from the author to get us all to feel that every man must have gay people in him. Before starting a four-storm here and being accused of homophobia, I have enjoyed many movies with gay love themes, especially "punks" when love comes and "b monkey". It seemed to be a man's desire for all young men, Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this ground and did a much better job on it, so I wonder if the co-brothers can get regional accents r and culture died in movies in Minnesota and in Mississippi, why can't anyone else? What a waste of my time.
