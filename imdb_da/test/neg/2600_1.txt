Words cannot describe how asinin, juvenile and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is. It relies on 3 things: 1. Constant 80s pop culture references 2. The tired "stretch a joke to the unpleasant" point and 3. At least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see that this crap party is just as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references that I suppose to induce an "OMG LOL FROM SUPERFRIENDS !! IT IS SO VERY IRONIC, AND I IS SO EDGY AND SMART FOR GETTING IT !! " response from the viewer. The scripture is beyond lazy and pans for its viewers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Plus there are designed designs that seem to consist of the same three characters with the same chained expressions drawn over and over, but with different skin colors and perhaps another hairline occasionally. Insulting crap.
