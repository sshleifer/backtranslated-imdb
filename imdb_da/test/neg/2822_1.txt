Sex, drugs, rock & roll are undoubtedly the worst product of Western civilization. The monologues are both uninteresting and meaningless In the rare monologue that catches the public's attention, it is quickly lost by too long repetition and unnecessary additions (The Hells Angels that McDonalds come to think) I think Bogosian's one-man show needed some filler to give a length which he believed justified the price of access. <br /> <br /> I'd rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained of my blood than see Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll again.
