A man wondering if his dear co-worker is gay. On a yard sale, he finds a jet gun called "Gaydar". You point it to a person, pull the trigger, and it tells you how gay they are. He tries it out, it works, and he goes out to find out if his colleague is gay like him ... Promising idea ruined by an unfunny script (after a promising start) and horrible plays. The whole throws over and basically scares their lines on each other all the time. It gets annoying and really embarrassing after a while. The saving grace is that it is short, there is a scene stealing cat (love her fall out of the kitty bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his short bit. But none of this saves the movie. I can't recommend it at all.
