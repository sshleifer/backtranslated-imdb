Pleasant but weak James Bond movie, mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) were seriously mistaken. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and seems more like the good-natured but bad sidekick in a police movie. The director and author are trying to establish their credibility, but his saying of lines like "Royal Baluga, North of the ..." is just not effective at establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas does not do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more appropriate for a mob gangster. The best portrayed characters in the movie are those of Tracy and her father. But the performances of these actors, when sharing the screen with Lazenby, only serve to emphasize their shortcomings as an actor. This movie is too long (140 minutes) for a Bond movie and doesn't give any excitement to Bond's mountain flight where it begins to pick up. This movie tries very hard, but falls short. Many Bondian elements are present and the climate is top notch, but I always get a feeling of something missing when looking at this.
