A horrible deception: Controversial movie, winner of Teddy in Berlin 2003, Milnubes de Paz proved to be a failure. The actors recite everyone (yes, they are not exactly actors); The film tried to be a big bet, but it ended up being a questionable bet: it remains in the surface of two guys who kiss and a guy whose boyfriend is gone; It has no meaning: Nothing to do with gay sexuality presented in other films (eg Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel). Technically, the only thing that works is the photography; Otherwise, the camera is placed at strange angles (to make it more 'art film'), and the whole movie runs in a black and white atmosphere. The movie is so pretentious that it bothers. I think it's good to be pretentious when you have the talent to support it. Or maybe it's that art cinema that is incomprehensible. The story slowly flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me more form than the essence. Super edition? It was good. Excellent direction? Don't think so: the movie is weak. It was an interesting project. It's a shame. It is a mistake. One star out of four.
