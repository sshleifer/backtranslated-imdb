After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth", the chapter that served as a kind of "death blow" to the franchise came another freaking cheapo cash-in, not as a surprise. A creepy attempt to explain every mystery about Pinhead and the puzzle, which literally covers centuries of history, in a movie that runs UNDER 90 minutes ... The display is subordinate to miserable plays that correspond to miserable B movies special effects and a ridiculous and insulting attempt at dark humor, while STILL is trying to keep the whole project seriously. I wonder how many freaking directors had this thing? Bad Pinhead has so much screen time that every bit of mystery and threat that this iconic character possesses is completely lost. After an hour's hearing of long-standing speeches and dramatic attitude, we just want to tell the guy to shut up! mildly entertaining in spots, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to feel like a cheap, ugly television spot after a while and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: Pinhead with his pet Cenobite dog, killing a bunch of idiots ... in outer space! I'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two movies in the series that gave this abortion of a movie more than 3 stars should be ashamed. On a side note, the movie follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent and stylish film-noir piece, which brilliantly reintroduces Pinhead as a master of illusion and cruelty, and returns the concept of the inherent evil in human form, which was the centerpiece of the original film and whole point of history. For any serious horror fan, see Hellraiser I & II, skip the miserable III & this one, and continue with 'Inferno.' You won't miss anything by skipping this waste ...
