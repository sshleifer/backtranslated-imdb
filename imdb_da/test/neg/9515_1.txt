When I voted my "1" for this movie, I noticed that 75 people voted the same out of 146 votes in total. That means half of the people who voted for this movie really feel terrible. I didn't see it long ago at a film festival, and I was really impressed with the poor performance. The kinematics are unmatched, the sound is bad, the story is cut and inserted from many other movies, and the play is terrible. This movie is basically a bad rip-off of three other movies. NO UNDER THIS IS NEVER LICED IN THE UNITED STATES.
