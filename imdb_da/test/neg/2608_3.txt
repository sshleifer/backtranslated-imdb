It had its moments, but overall when I looked at this cartoon as a child, I was saddened by myself. The only thing that kept me from seeing was that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime. It is also one of my least favorite anime, I can remember others involving a huge ship in the room that didn't make sense, but was more comfortable because they were in the room. I also remember one with these people dressed as birds that were a little strange but more entertaining. I don't really like car driving myself, but it didn't and still not, it's probably one of the reasons I wasn't interested in this show, even though I am an avid anime fan today. The characters were also a bit of a bitch, and then there were the horrible scenes where almost no action took place that was probably used to cut down on animation costs and to polish the show. The gadgets in the cars were cool and gave some entertainment to me then. Overall, I find this show to be a bit unmatched compared to newer animations and some from the same era, but it's just a personal opinion, I'm sure many other reviewers love the show, which is cool.
