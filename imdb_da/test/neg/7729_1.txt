It's almost embarrassing to say that I saw this movie myself. I mean, it doesn't take much to make a good zombie film in addition to good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. Does House Of The Dead 2 Do Any Of These Things Right? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as its predecessor, from Uwe Bowle, and that's the only thing about this movie that scares me. The dialogue in this movie is notorious, with such lines as "What do you live?" In response: "I kill zombies" and "I was never a disc jockey, I was a soldier." The special effects are embarrassing, even for one made for TV movies, I mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips that are hyped up on crack. The Army base in this movie is a car park, with a desk and an open gated room. This film is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed creator space. In fact, this whole movie seems to be filmed in a middle school. <br /> <br /> Why is it that all the female soldiers in this movie are models? And for that matter, why are everyone in this movie unclear about what's going on, they simply just stand around and let the zombies kill them. Heck a guy even tries to give food to the zombie. Overall, this film makes the worst of Scifi Channel movies look great.
