This video has sound intended for someone to hear during their sleep. And the same can be said for the video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife pretend to be at minimum wage jobs? With a camera rolling? And his little wife-poo complains? Give me a break. They are both rich. They sit in their fake $ 350 / month apartment, filming this with their $ 1,000 / month every video crew of 12. <br /> <br /> I used to respect Morgan, but now his "30 day" experience is nothing Other than trying to trick any volunteer viewers who are willing to fool. <br /> <br /> C'mon Morgan, you are filmed with a $ 6.00 job per hour, and you are paid by naive employers who don't see the big cameras filming it all ?? And we shouldn't believe they don't pay you under the table?
