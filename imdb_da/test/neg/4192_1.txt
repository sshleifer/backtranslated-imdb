This is the worst movie I have ever seen, as well as the worst I will ever see. I see no reason to rehash what everyone else has said before, just be warned ... This is not one of the bad movies you think you want to see because you will be able to make fun of it BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH. <br /> <br /> This movie is like having a "pet rock" as your friend. You are waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were coming into. The lion gate totally cheats on this bombshell ... No ... it's a disaster. After watching this movie, you would swear George W. Bush had his hands all over the movie. Yes, it's the idiotic. Stay away unless you just want to watch the worst movie all the time. It's probably how Lion's Gate figured it would make some money out of this piece of tripe.
