I'm not familiar with the manufacturer's other works, but this film is a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the MST3K version, but I can tell you that Mike and Bots probably haven't saved it. <br /> <br /> I love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but it was almost unmatched. <br /> <br /> There was no credit for who made the voice of "The Dark One". Obeyed a bit like Patrick Stewart at times. <br /> <br /> A group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash could make a better movie than that.
