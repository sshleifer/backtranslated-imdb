I like Arnold and I love the subject, but it was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the guardians, they were dark and malicious, and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I recognized him, which made me believe that he made a movie that had more of a serious, exciting mood. That it was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit most of his are pretty good!). He had so far avoided filming with any real religious theme. And I was thrilled. I was mistaken. This is just another action, explosion, gun fire film. And it's a pretty bad one.
