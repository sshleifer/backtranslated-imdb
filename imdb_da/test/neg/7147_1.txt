Throughout this movie, I wondered why on earth they did this as a "documentary", but not with real recordings of the people interviewed? Sure, it would have been like any other documentary, but then it would have been the filmmakers to find the meaning of the movie to deliver. <br /> <br /> Using a number of well-known movie stars (many of them apparently asked to be in it) to portray "real" people gave me the feeling that there was a predetermined message to be delivered. and the director was so determined that real people could not rely on actors and repeated scenes to be used. (Yes, I also know that this was also a game, but a documentary should be a documentary.) I really found myself being dismissed by the different stars, and waited for one of them to drop character for a moment and say "I'm a good person because I'm in this." <br /> <br /> This movie could have had a much stronger social comment if it was more objective or let's see Matthew Shepard and his killers as people rather than symbols. (The very superior "Boys Do not Cry" had an unimaginable view of the people involved - good and bad.) Instead, the Laramie project launches an almost relentless lecture that the sexuality of the other must be accepted regardless and slightly.
