Looks and looks like a cheap porn without sex, it's the first in an impressive string stinker from the producer (or in this case director) Geoffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And it's a doozy. Laughable at almost every level. Some government agents (I believe) are "professionally murdered" in Amsterdam and a significantly smaller than charismatic interpol agent (whom I assure you is not named Louis Salinger) has been submitted to investigate by going a long way to ensure that The tax finance financers get their money to cost the plane tickets to shoot on the spot. <br /> <br /> The wannabe hard hit the stance on drugs and the depiction of prostitution must have looked frighteningly obsolete even before the celluloid dried, but the manuscript is at least very obligatory because it explains exactly what is happening regularly in horribly constructed direlogue ("Were you followed? oh no of course not. No one outside of Washington even knows you're here!") Nevertheless, the listing remains confusing. At that time, an eerie Vladimir Putin lookalike priest (no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love) will swagger up to the pulpit to deliver a sermon, your brain will be turned off, which is unfortunate because you will miss our hero - attached to the earth during a fight - struggles to reach a wooden board only to realize later that he is actually sitting on a loaded gun, and he shouts "You bastaaaard!" with his friend's murdered corpse and the leather-bound, moustachioed go-go boys, the morris dance and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which give ample laugh. Only the climactic boat hunt impresses. It's an exciting, orderly sequence that doesn't really fit in this movie. Such a sharp anomaly is explained when the credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with the sequence! Fortunately, everything goes back to the business as usual for the ridiculous, spit-out-your-drink twist and stock shootout. Unless such a miserable thing as a Geoffrey Reeve completist exists - and you're one of them - I wouldn't interfere with this instant forgettable nonsense.
