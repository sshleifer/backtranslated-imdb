In my opinion, the film was ridiculous - poor dialogue. The one who wrote the script - please keep your daily job. There is absolutely no godfather or goodfellas. It's good to be on the other side of the table - bad choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget film without name players.
