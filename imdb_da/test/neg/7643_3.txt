Sayles had a very interesting movie on his hands with Silver City, but somehow it was very muddied as it evolved from the beginning to the end. Chris Cooper did an extraordinary job characterizing his character, a Dubya kind, but he was barely given enough screen time. Instead, we find ourselves on a rampage with a sign that felt less personal, less developed and generally too confusing. The path that this Danny Huston leads us becomes inevitable for the movie's downfall. Too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. These signs were randomly involved in the plot's progression, which became envelope with each passing minute. Sayles knew what he was creating, I just feel like it wasn't translated well into the silver screen. Sayles is a master of his trade. His film continues to inspire and evoke thoughts, even though they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think he found himself too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all. At the start of the film I had an idea of ​​what happened, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plot twists tried to occur, I lost the feeling of the movie at the end. While the finish was very smart and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think part of the reason I lost the mindset with this movie was because Danny Huston was cast as our guide. He was pathetic. I didn't like him as a very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. He seemed to go through the movements, but really not much at all. This was the first decline in Sayles' important movie. While I admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon, and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston just didn't cut it for me. Outside the characters, Sayles had a stronger script. I sometimes felt that unless I was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were well above my head. The whole reasoning that Silver City should be built and the corruption behind it avoided me. I am a simple one who loves advanced movies, but this didn't make much sense to me. There were several times that I asked myself, "Why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt that the individual stories were as clear as glass, but the whole picture was dusty and scary at the same time. Sayles needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these minor issues, which eventually fogged this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went into this movie with the wrong idea. I expected to see another version of primary colors, but instead experienced something less fervent and more technical. Without closing, I thought the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the political cinema history. The brilliant symbolism has been in my mind the last two days after watching this movie, while the rest of the film quickly disappointed away from my mind. Maybe another view would make me better, but for some strange reason, Silver City didn't just deal with me. There seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or explained. An ensemble piece is always good with me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, it just loses steam. This was one of those rare occasions. All in all, I was very sorry about this movie. To be very democrat, I would see a side of the policy that I was not aware of and another side that would make you chuckle. I wanted to be flooded with the world of corporate money and the dufus chosen. I wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of George W. but instead everything I found was a very confusing story aimed at a particular audience that I will never be with. Sadly, this picture had so much wasted promise. <br /> <br /> Degree: ** out of *****
