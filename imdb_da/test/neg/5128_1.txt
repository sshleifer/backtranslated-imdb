I was a college sophomore when this movie came out and I had never seen it before last night. I finally decided to watch it because I like good dancing and because the film had such cultural influence. After watching the movie, I'm completely confused about how it had any other effect than putting people in bed. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that the beers full of gnarly old steelworkers and teamsters could keep their clients with the high concept dances they girls did? They would all have been over to Zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". Can you imagine the reaction of the real-life versions of that audience to the bizarre television that does not see any theater dance thing that she did? Please. <br /> <br /> It seems likely that there could be a woman who worked in a steelworks and also was a dancer - they are both physically demanding jobs. But I didn't buy a second that this girl worked in a steelworks. And I didn't buy a second that I looked at a real steel mill. Steel work is dangerous. You don't have to keep your work area lying like a junk yard and not end up losing a limb. I love some of the inane shots that when two welders are in the large corrugated pipe welding. What the hell are they doing in there? Or when she cuts six inches of a rusty steel rod with a cutting torch. She was obviously in control and just started to cut random things. <br /> <br /> But the stories like being overlooked if the movie is fun or at least somehow stimulates. Flashdance does not offer anything to balance it. <br /> <br /> The dancing terrible. It's the spastic trait and style that destroyed American musicals until ... well are we really over it yet? The sensuality that the movie is trying for is destroyed by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality. I think I'm a 42-year-old man, and when she was going to eat lobster, my only reaction was to think she should get a lobster bib. You can't really get behind Alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and low. The dog had more on it than she did. <br /> <br /> The love affair is flat. It comes across as nothing more than a boss with hots for one of his workers. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the last scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfactory because the panel reaction is so incredible. What serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes on Alex's lame cheerleader routine? In short, the film had nothing but leg warmer and big sweatshirts. Oh yes, there is a good nudity when Alex "rescues" his friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a ridiculous hypocrisy). Apart from that, the movie is a waste of time. I want the MST3K crew still in operation. This would feed them well.
