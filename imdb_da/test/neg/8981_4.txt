This is due to a large part of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite adult, it is partly the story of a wealthy boy who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo ship and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a youthful young woman who has also come up with a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo is incinerated, she and crew members are evacuated to our boys ship. The captain, however, has smuggled his mind, and his intentions are not reputable where Moran is concerned. The inevitable consequences - our boy falls for the male Moran and she for him. Eventually, evil is subdued and the lovers are united. Some interesting dialogues indicate that Moran belongs to no man - "and no woman". (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive. Valentino is good at a romantic, role of action. His sexy structure and physics are shown in favor, and the role is rather masculine. He is very appealing. This is not a good movie, but it is time. What it really shows is Valentino's beauty and sexiness.
