I saw this movie knowing that it would be horrible but damn if it did not break new and revolutionary land in the field to make fecal material acceptable as entertainment. The foundation is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this ... well ... wow there really is no way to put this movie down because I think the words should not yet be created in English. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought that they actually did something good. You won't believe in your eyes when you see how many movies they slipped out without trying to hide it. There are scenes / plot units right out of Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list could continue forever. However, unlike any of these films, it only falls off celluloid stools. The most incredible thing about this movie, except the way it tries to be competent but fails, is that Gimli ham-freakin 'is in it. How the hell do they afford John Rhys-Davies, but not decent effects, writing, actors, or sets. Really terrible ... and not the kind of bad, it's good.
