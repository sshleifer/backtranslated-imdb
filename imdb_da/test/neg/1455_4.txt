Overrated mob comedy. Director Demme pauses the actors for some fun lines to let the audience laugh and not miss the next line. Seems strange - this director did "the silence of the lamb" - now it is possible to spend breaks! Casting occurs. Mathew Modine too young for the FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell does a Jack Nicholson thing with a bias and he gets a nomination for it! Plus, do we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mob lawyer are underutilized with only one line each - they should be bumbling hoods. Song score by Chris Isaak is completely out of place - better for a flick like "Pretty In Pink." Re-make this movie, it's worth it, but with proper casting and instructor and satire will come through ... even the often repeated "Forgedaboutit."
