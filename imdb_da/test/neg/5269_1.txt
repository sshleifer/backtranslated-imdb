"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is kind of based on the exploitation of Martin Cahill, who is already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 movie "The General". Cahill had a serious upbringing in a slum area and graduated from small crime to armed robbery with honors. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his bad background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals who conveniently overlook thousands of slum dwellers who do not turn to robbing post offices and selling weapons to make ends meet. Cahill fooled the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, who earned him some kind of "Folk Hero" status as well as making him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral self-serving thief. My primary problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is made to be a lovable Irish villain. Kevin Spacey does a good job showing Michael Lynch with a blend of oily charm and silent threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be considered a kind of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The movie is well shot and well acted on with a fine cast, but what it lets down is the script. Author Gerard Stembridge cannot appear; does he write an Irish "Lock Stock" or a minor treatment of Martin Cahill's theft career? That is the problem when an author bases his core character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also unfortunate that "ODC" followed the movie's release of John Boorman's "The General," which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's history. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good disclosure, so it's not surprising that his exploits were filming. What is surprising is that a studio was ready to take Cahill's history and give it a Happy Hollywood style ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist thief Michael Lynch has to go out for anonymity on his motorcycle in "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, just to prove that no one is fooled by an outdated, sectarian and corrupt paramilitary organization and comes away with it. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never have gone away from his notoriety because it reinforced his "man of peoples" self-image. Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in "ODC" is a cop-out ending in a faint and shallow movie.
