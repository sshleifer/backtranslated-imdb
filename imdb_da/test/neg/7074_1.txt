"Tamara" just felt like another teen-oriented pioneer of "I know what you did last summer" trend and is painfully boring. A high school outcast that is heavily into witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed during a cruel prank by a group of bullies secretly burying her in the woods and vowed to tell anyone. The next day, the supposed "dead" Tamara comes to school with a whole new image and seduces her wild murderers and has a little revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft" and every other straight-to- video, teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. The actors are quite terrible and look about ten years old to pass as high schoolers. There is something going on that is actually nothing so interesting since the movie is so boring, and I couldn't wait for it to end. If you like modern waste than I insist on, you're looking for this one, or don't bother ...
