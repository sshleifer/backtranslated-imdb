A woman who is in love with her husband (he is suicide) decides to have a baby save his life. She has been in a fertility clinic - just like the lover she is taking - so both know how artificial insemination works; But instead of using the thousands of people method, every year around the world ($ 5 turkey bastards), they engage in coitus. We must also believe that even if the immigrant is in love with his fiance, he does not propose the obvious alternative to intercourse. Although this is a business arrangement, she is the first to use her sperm donor, she takes off all her clothes as if it were a seduction. Plus, her husband doesn't notice that $ 30,000 is missing from their bank accounts. Does all this seem to require more willing suspension of infidelity than even most Hollywood fares? Far on all counts.
