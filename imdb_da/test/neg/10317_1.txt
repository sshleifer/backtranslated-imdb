My first warning should have been that this DVD was for sale for $ 5.00. But since it was Sandra Bullock, which I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the movie began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and rigid. The color is distorted. I continued to adjust the volume to hear the conversations. The action is amateurish. Even killing scenes are a failure. Twice the dead people moved their legs. When my money-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and pleasantly met. This is an incredibly bad movie. Tomorrow I'll give this DVD away on the company's white elephant Christmas party.
