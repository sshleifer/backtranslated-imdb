This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could hardly be awake. The play and the plot were terrible. I like B movies, but this movie has nothing that can make me laugh or think. OK, there were two or three fun moments in the beginning, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10. If you really want to see it, watch the first 10 minutes. Then you become more and more disappointed while the movie is running.
