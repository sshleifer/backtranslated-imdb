I had picked this one time in the rental store and wondered if I should give it a shot. Today I broke down and gave it a whirl, and I probably shouldn't. <br /> <br /> While the author / director gave the film a respectable effort, it went far from engaging. The characters, while you wanted to feel for them, just didn't have enough development or depth to really get involved with them. Sara's sexual outbreaks became tiring quickly. I don't mind sex in movies and I don't mind bitchy characters, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean you tend to tense people randomly if they want sexual favors. At that time, what happened to the characters was revealed, I was bored and ready to accelerate to the climax, the end, something exciting ... and nothing was delivered. The things that people in the story tell you about seem to be forced and unrealistic, and just didn't play right. If they would have thrown a bit more anxiety in there, I might have been interested. This should have been a more exciting / drama movie, and should have attached to the title "Jon Good's Wife" rather than the whole "red right hand" and horror movie-like cover. Hell ... this should have had excitement, period. <br /> <br /> Whatever ... watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on TV. Although this is not as big as I had hoped, I would go over this over some infomercials.
