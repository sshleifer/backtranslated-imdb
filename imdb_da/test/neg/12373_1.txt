This is a really horrible sci-fi / horror movie from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr. and his terrible movie much publicity, then this turkey is as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the play is a little better than you would find in Wood Epics (like PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Woods! But bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it is so bad that it is still excellent viewing. As a wooden film, it is great to see this crap party and laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a scientist flying to test some of his jet. But out of nowhere, a UFO stripes and his report on this over the radio triggers a panic of the Air Force. Later, however, they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio, and they believe the researcher is a distress! But soon when these planes begin to disappear everywhere, they are aware that there must be something to look at. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is not amazing, but it can be seen. But at that time, the horrible flying monster appears, you know you see a turkey. First, sustained use of stock movies and crappy models, airplanes continue to change mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this, but with aviation lovers like me, I saw that an F-80 that became an F-86 for an F-102 airplane made me crazy, especially since the planes are not similar. Secondly, through "smart" filmography, all you really see from the monster is a ball of fuzz for half of the movie! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally see it, it will be worth the wait. Well, not so lucky !! The "monster" looks less realistic or scary than the ducks from Groucho's TV show! In fact, it is considerably less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters !! In fact, Big Bird from "Sesame Street" is even a bit scary and realistic !!! It's just God-fearing in every way and can just be the stupidest movie monster in history - just as bad (or worse) as monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM Outer Space !!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely horrible movie that sane people will not suffer. Bad movie fans like me (who are a crazy group) will probably love it! Everybody else ... be scared .... be very scared! <br /> <br /> FYI - You may notice that some clips in this movie are from other sci-fi movies !! I am positive that the broken down Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, but I also saw a few other scenes that I swear are from other movies. What a hack job!
