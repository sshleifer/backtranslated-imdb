This movie shook my will to live, why this abomination is not the bottom 100 list I do not know. <br /> <br /> My life was saved by the healing power danny trejo. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever, I dare to see you. It's like a 90 minute collection that calls commercial, only very much worse. I'm looking a little at the blue screen, it's really bad
