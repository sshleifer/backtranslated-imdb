Director John Madden, of Shakespeare in Love's fame, gives us another pretty bad movie in Ethan Frome. The plot is centered around a new preacher who enters the town of Starkfield, where he learns the story of the local curly man Ethan Frome's sick wife and the one-time romantic bustle of the girl. Adapted by Richard Nelson of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edith Wharton's novel, this film is not interesting at least thanks to an abysmally faint manuscript and bad direction, changing scenes that should be exciting in ridiculous schmaltz. Still, there are other aspects that are separate from the movie that works - the cinematography is well done, Rachel Portman contributes a nice score, and while none is the best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well in their roles. But in general, Ethan Frome is only marginally worth it and is easily forgotten.
