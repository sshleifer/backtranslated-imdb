The last of the "Airport" sequels. This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who were in all airport movies) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as newswoman targeted at death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing); Eddie Albert as chairman of the airlines; Charo in a horrible "comic" bit; John Davidson as a beginner (loves how his hair stays in place even after the plane turns upside down!); poor Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother flying a heart for her dying son (stop rolling your eyes!); Jimmie Walker as clarinet (what did I say about not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as Russian gymnastics coach (OK you can laugh at one); Bibi Andresson as a hooker and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Just pathetic. Full of stupid plot and dialogue that makes you roar - watch Davidson get "married" on the plane near the end! Concorde takes all these people to Russia. They are attacked with missiles, escape, land safely in France and TAKE OFF AGAIN VERY THE NEXT DAY !!!! Don't you think the plane would have been canceled or something? Most of the play is terrible - McCambridge is a sight to see in a red scarecrow and a horrible fake accent. The only good spectacle is from Kennedy and Delon (looks great), giving a very exciting performance. Yet it is not enough to make you sit through this drift. Too long and miserable special effects too. This was a megabomb and (luckily) Universal stopped doing longer.
