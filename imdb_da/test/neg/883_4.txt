If you read the book before watching the movie, you may be disappointed as I was. The book was great and I was sure that after watching the movie show that the movie would be great too, but I felt I saw a movie where the director and the cast didn't even read what those characters were. The film is short and they do not really make us feel that these people were really in love and felt like the only sister. Although the film did not go in the same direction as the book at least, they could make the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters, and they have good chemistry, but they didn't just develop a long story for us to see how they longed for each other. The book was true love story, and I think this movie could have been much better.
