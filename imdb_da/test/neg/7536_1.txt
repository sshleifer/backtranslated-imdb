I think we should think of the wonderful salt-of-the-earth signs. Unfortunately, this is lamb and worked. As always with any production in Newcastle, there are many shots of the Tyne Bridge and frequent attempts to show which great "signs" Geordies are. The viewer must never forget where the movie is set, as if the rest of the world was concerned about Newcastle and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> If you like being well-observed, the literary and original work remains clear.
