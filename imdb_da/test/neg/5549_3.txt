Low-budget schlockmeister Herschell Gordon Lewis reaches a new low (even for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls," a "movie" (snicker) that possesses all his technical trademarks: poorly recorded sound, poor lighting and OTT gore. This would be tolerable, even a little charming if the movie had at least an interesting plot ("Blood Feast" in all its ridiculous glory is a good example), but "Girls" is a total snooze. Totally inappropriate pompous-butt private researcher Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who has murdered out-of-shape strippers (you will stop worrying about who the blame is long before these two pack up the case). As before, the appeal is not plotted, but the creative methods of bloodletting (including a girl's bird tame with a wooden tail) and occasionally flashing of da-risqu√© skin ... but it's just not enough to raise the material over the tedium.
