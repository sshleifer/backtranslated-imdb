This is a serious movie about black revolutionaries and not really an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man engaged in racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It is rather ugly and realistic without exploiting the characters, but it is not that interesting either, and Billy Dee's character, although mistreated by white authority figures, does not really seem to be sympathetic. It is also hurt by the extremely low budget. It is still interesting to look at, as it is a good illustration of the social issues of 1970s.
