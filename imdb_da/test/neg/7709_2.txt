OK this movie was far worse than the first and the first sucked! Zombie make-up was extremely fake! The action is very poor! And it doesn't really follow the first! As I looked at this, I continued to think wow the first one is a masterpiece in relation to this. I mean to catch it on TV, not spend your money on it! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but its on the list. I started to see it last night and fell asleep so I saw it today and almost fell asleep again! The reason was pointless, I think I get the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to get the blood in the leading zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies, but they did That where you wanted everyone to die. They made lots of villains that were really just annoying. If you ask me, this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. The reason could have done it if the play was good, and if they actually made you be afraid to see what was behind the corner. With these zombies, my grandmother could have gone into the building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give a 2.
