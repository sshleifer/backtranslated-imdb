Laughable. <br /> <br /> Overdose in style to compensate for poor writing. Remember when MTV actually used to fly music videos and other shows besides Reality programs? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on such a show ?? a cartoon from the mid 90s ?? featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the delightful Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel that is as clever as a line dancer and as deadly as a viper snake. She must be if she expects to kick the totalitarian government's asses. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology - overdose movies like The Island (2005) and equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but is enhanced. That is, there is nothing original back so they compensate for it with the sleek style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux, which serves it a few points but scratches the surface and there is literally nothing there. To make matters worse, all the ideas in this movie are terrible and some actually hurt me to see. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is interwoven with the most cheesy hard chick schtick and it seems as if director Karyn Kusama can't quite decide where to go with her next ?? should she make her more loose or more emotional? She does not know! Let's go both ways! Imagine taking a shotgun, allowing it to be filled with character developments of different kinds and burning in a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. The movie Aeon Flux presents all the "mandatory" ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotions vs. cold cause etc. . You've seen all this before, and better done about it. Go to Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even see Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... anything! Avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese feast as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
