I had some expectations from this movie because 1. It was a Yash raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed to be captivating 3. The star shape (??!) Was new. Now I have to tell you that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lips - what were the make-up artists thinking ???) is trying hard to look tough but doesn't fail. I don't even want to get started with his acting (if you can call it). 'Cleavage queen' Tanisha with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration. I think Uday was a little more tolerable than her! She seriously needs to take acting from her sister. The story is pathetic ... the same old tested and tested formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worth seeing in this movie. Make me wonder why it was made in the first place!
