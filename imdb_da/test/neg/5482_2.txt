It's just 2 stars because they put a lot of effort into making this game look good. I played lots of good and bad games and I think this game has the most boring story I ever had to listen to. The best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversation (but no, you have to listen to those who talk for 10 minutes) and just keep doing the same things over and over again. Climb the building, save the citizens, kill some guys. It's the same! Ubisoft really should hire someone with some imagination. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what happens next time all the time. I don't even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone responsible for developing the story of Assassin's Creed should be banned from writing another thing for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Drilling history and same missions over and over again! If only one of these two things was good, the game would be worth playing.
