Before you start with whether this movie is worth your time or not, I have to inform you that I have never seen another adaptation of Carmen, so if you are looking for a review of how it is among others, it is maybe not much to use for you. <br /> <br /> The only time I encountered Carmen was on the car stereo when I was driving through Spain on a family vacation when I was a teenager. I didn't pay much attention to it because I didn't like opera at that time and I didn't know better. History has existed for 150 years or so. Do I feel like I have missed out after watching this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega, I'd happily have all the adjustments in my DVD collection. Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also tells the story of Joaquim Jordà), tells the story through the eyes of the original writer Prosper Mérimée, a French writer who makes his way through the 19th century Spain. He comes across José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a criminal soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sultry, sexy, bedazzling gypsy woman who has the devil's mouth, toro, and who is tireless leads men to their death. The moment she meets José, she is attracted to his abominable behavior. But she chops him, rolls him in and lets him go many times. Until one day, José wanted murder. Carmen persuades him to join his band of gypsy smugglers. They seem to settle down, she is in love with him, but she meets the charming Escamillo, the bullfighter. Can José keep his jealousy in check, or does he destroy him? <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, seductive story that resembles almost a Shakespearian or Ovid plot with depictions of tremendous passion and emotions that can make or destroy us and transform us into making things out of character. It is poetic, burning and above all erasing. I was left hanging on, I didn't know which way to go. I always hoped that José could change Carmen's dirty little ways. I will not tell you if he succeeded or not. <br /> <br /> The above synopsis is what I took away from the movie, but I wasn't impressed with the movie itself. It was only after I watched that I dug a little deeper into the story, and I realized how much of a missed opportunity Aranda had made to tell Mérimée's classic. It was a superficial, slutty period-drama blunder that saw Paz Vega spend much of the time completely or partially down (not that I am complaining about this especially!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the play was poor. I was not impressed with Sbaraglia as José. I'm still unsure if he was a weak actor or José should be a weak character, I haven't read the book. He was supposed to be a man with a burning desire for Carmen, but he spends a lot of time looking confused, jealous and a little weak. Paz Vega was a little better than Carmen. I was convinced by her hardened, evil character, though I have seen more convincing notions of her in other films, such as Zapping and Lucia and El Sexo. She seems too beautiful to play a gypsy wife (not that I have encountered many Andalusian gypsy women), so somehow the role didn't really fit her. The other actors in the film were not great either. They seemed to do everything half-heartedly. The story is passionate, emotional ?? they were so half arsed as if they couldn't wait to get out of the tight 19th century costumes they were wearing. <br /> <br /> But the costumes I was impressed with - one of the release factors in film. I like the Spanish culture, I liked the uniforms of the soldiers, the top hats and the women's Flamenco dresses. They adhered to the time well. That's all I can really say about it. Sorry, back to the criticism. The script, as mentioned above, was rewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà, and so badly that it would leave Mérimée to turn in his grave. It was boring. It didn't make the best use of José's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just the actor). There were cheesy lines stacked on each other, Satan and Devil's connotations everywhere among the millions of swear words. I know that the Spanish are partial to the odd word of word, but the film was filled with puta, "whore", in literally every line. Perhaps it was realistic in the poor Seville in the 19th century, but the story itself did not need it. <br /> <br /> The editing and camera work was boring and plain. There was only a little I liked and that was when the camera follows a plane close-up in the middle of the air that lands on Carmens face. It was good. But the rest? Boring. To conclude, it is sad to see such a great story go into play with convincing action and direction. If you are a literary teacher, let your class look at this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. But only half the class pays any interest in the movie thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, you stick to the opera version (although I hate musicals). I give this movie 4 just because I love the story! And Paz Vega!
