I happened to catch this on TV and wanted to watch because I remembered the Spin magazine article on which the movie is based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is a leading actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it's not exactly an A-list production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately not a great actor. In fact, all plays in this movie are either flat or hammy, which can only be caused by the director, who is the weakest link of this movie. Charles Carner seemed to try to monkey Oliver Stone's "JFK" to portray the alleged conspiracy to cover the "real" child murder (s), but without having a good script, an A list must be thrown or it must be said the talent . It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that such a worthy subject for a movie didn't get better treatment.
