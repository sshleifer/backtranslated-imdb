The white warrior is definitely one of if not Steve Reeves weakest movie. Seen in the 18th or 19th century Russia (?) Steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to overthrow a mad man Russian csar by running up a hillside with his rebel band in a greasy looking Russian white tunic ..... For For the most part, the large Reeves body is hidden in a tough knee-length tunic with an even more sore Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is quite minimal, with only a good break scene from the middle of the life it shows the great Reeves physics. This is an apparent attempt by manufacturers to move Reeves out of sword and sandal genre into another historic era of poor performance. The dialogue from the script is difficult to understand at various points, and only comments from the narrator enable the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. I would image Reeves reluctant to make this movie, but in an effort to try to get out of his towel and sandals and tribune armor, it helped launch him into other historical characters such as Morgan the Pirate and Thief of Baghdad.
