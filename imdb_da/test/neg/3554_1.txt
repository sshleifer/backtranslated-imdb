One of the most boring movies I've ever had to sit through, it's totally formal. Just a cookie cutout of a movie you could predict about each scene in the movie right from knowing the genre, as this movie doesn't add anything new. The dialogue is never fun, interesting or intelligent. The action is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - essentially everything seems to have been done by an amateur movie maker. Nothing new, memorable or entertaining in this movie combined with the fact that it is a long way gives it a light thumbs down. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F
