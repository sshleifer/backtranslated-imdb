Exceeded by the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this movie quiet (about 2 hours) and full of clichés. A little girl gets more personalities after a childhood injury, etc. Tamer KAradagli is quiet fun in this movie, dialogues movements, etc. You have to see it, he is right the hard politician you look at American movies, maybe copied too much. I want to describe this movie as an ordinary American thriller with a little bit of Turkish touch. Unfortunately, I am convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in Turkish cinema. At least I gave this movie a 4, it's too dull and full of clichés
