First of all, I would like to mention that it is incredibly stupid to call your movie "Embryo" when the subject is exclusively about scientific research done on fetuses (animals as well as humans) aged 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week, and from that moment the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. Okay, honestly, I didn't know all this, but I tried to look it up and it's also the least that the creators of "Embryo" could have done. Do not worry; I don't just stumble over details or are overly bitter, as there are several more reasons to state why "Embryo" is a big failure. Scientific science can be considered dull and inaccessible, and therefore Science Fiction is a cinematic genre created specifically to make the otherwise boring but educational issues more interesting and understandable to the wider audience. By portraying ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong or space missions abusing evil aliens instead of light years in void, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects while teaching them useful little trivia about science. To make a good or at least halfway decent science fiction movie, writers and directors only have to adhere to a basic rule: Don't let me get bored! If they cannot fulfill this condition, the viewer may as well read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "Embryo". The basic premise may be fascinating and even involved as we are all sensitive to saving the lives of unborn babies. There were also some very prominent names involved in the production, such as the lead roles Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice Does not Live Here Anymore") and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". So what went wrong? Simple. The manuscript is impenetrably dull, clichy, and it all looks incredibly foolish, because the lab landscape and scientific equipment are clearly primitive to achieve any medical breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays in a very poor performance a doctor who has not put any passion into his research work ever since his wife died. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy day, he returns, and he does everything possible to save the fetuses of the dying animals. He manages to keep a fetus alive, quickly impresses the growth process and train it to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, Dr. Paul Holliston's friend in the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. The female subject, however, remains unexpectedly fast, and after only a few weeks she is a full-grown, devoted and super-intelligent woman. Of course, the good doctor falls in love with her, but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show terrible side effects ... Absolutely nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the movie, except for a lot of incredible and all-melodramatic mumbo jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog. The other half of the film contains a little (grotesque) action and excitement, but then the stupidity of dialogue and the incomparable plot twists already destroyed the potentially amazing Sci-Fi idea. There are some really cool scenes, especially the chess showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a very memorable and ultra-unpleasant supporting role). The grand final is absurdly grotesque and literally on the brink of ridiculous, and it almost feels like Ralph Nelson put the last catastrophic shot because it was the general rule of modern thriller and sci-fi cinema. The last sequence, including the terrible freeze-frame shot at the end, certainly doesn't fit in the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the movie. But still, my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and his trainer. An animal with such intellect and talent certainly deserves to show its tricks in a much better movie.
