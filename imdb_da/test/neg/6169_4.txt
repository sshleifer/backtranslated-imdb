Let me first say that I rarely go through movies, I only comment if I am blown away or disappointed by something I thought would be good. Killshot was a big disappointment at so many levels. The script was horrible, the actor was sub-par (especially derived from heavy weights such as Rourke and Lane) and editing and effects were comical (inflating cars, etc.) Rosario Dawson had a horrible role I can't believe would even accept it was such an abuse of her talent, I can't even put into words. I should have known after I watched the trailer for this movie 3 years ago, and it was shrouded that their was a serious problem with this movie .......... B movies all the way ... ...... don't bother unless you really get bored ........
