This is a family movie sent to my local ITV station at. 1.00 a couple of nights ago. This can be a strange decision on the part of the planners, but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange movie, strange in the way it won't disturb its audience. Come on, there are no children as more than sadism, and so Roald Dahl was such a popular writer for children. It also explains why Dr. WHO was such a well-done show around the world. In this manuscript you just die for the pulp fiction author to do something uncomfortable for the kids, but it doesn't. I do not advocate child abuse, but to see that Howard Spitz loses his rag on the little ones would have made the movie better. Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the manufacturers had gone all the PCs? I mean, if you are making a movie centered around a child's writer who hates children, history shouldn't show and not tell? <br /> <br /> Much of the problem lies with Director Vadim Jean, and you get the feeling that he doesn't know how to handle the bad news material for the movie. As mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is random, and Kelsey Grammar is very wood. I suppose he was trying to play the dead pan like in the show he is famous for, but it fails to work here and there are many scenes with silent ridiculous camera angles that seem unintentional but very distracting. But at the end of the day, the biggest problem remains that the potential is destroyed because no one wanted to offend the public's sensitivities
