When I saw this movie it was an afternoon after I got home from work. I love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy, but it takes the cake. The plot presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems a bit exciting, but when the film progresses, the script makes a wrong trip with horrible clich√©s and poor presentation, which again makes the movie completely boring and boring. I don't mean to criticize the script and plot because believe me it's not the worst part. I have to say as a whole, the play was not terrible for beginning actors, and I was impressed by Taylor Locke, this is one of his first films. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They reeked of low budget and really ruined the viewers entertainment even though he had been far interested in the plot. I recommend watching this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
