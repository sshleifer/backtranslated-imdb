A little too much Mediterrenean machismo for me. The casting was beautiful, lovely to see in all the romantic scenes. Locale was beautiful with azure sky and azure water. It was just not convincing to me that such an egoic crucifix bowed to anything other than his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable women. Only in the Mediterranean I think. Absolutely not in any world I am familiar with. The Macho men were really obnoxious, and I found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything with them for so long. The manuscript, cinematography, director, etc. was created to deliver a class B movie, the key action being to show scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. It was aesthetically pleasing for a while, but it couldn't maintain a very mediocre movie.
