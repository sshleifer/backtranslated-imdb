Ah Animorphs. I loved the book series and eagerly ate every one in the middle school, and when I heard there was a TV adaptation, I was very excited. Boy, what a shattered end product was. I think for me it was the moment Nickelodeon stopped being cold programming and more generic. So what was wrong with the series? Let me count the way: 1. The characters were HORRIFICALLY miscast. In the books Animorphs was somewhere between 12-14, the TV casting was at least 18. I remember being horrified when I first saw the cast images. <br /> <br /> 2. Frightening action / bad writing. I dunno who was to blame, so I slip into the lumpy mass as it was. Perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast inhibits the humor that at least is sweet to get out of a 13 year old because Marco - not fun. In fact, I can't remember a single comic moment from the group and there were a few. The actors were certainly not helped by writing, which was bland at best, and head beautifully pathetic at worst. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord, they were stingy with the budget. The final result of Andalucia alone should have convinced Viacom to pull the stopper ... The heads had gaps that clearly showed which helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the cast - Rachel was by far the biggest disappointment, far from being the warrior woman in the books, and the best thing about the TV series was "scarecrow". I also know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Should the music be so obvious? 6. Answering Question 6, "Yes" because everything else was stupid, why would the expected less intelligent viewers not receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap-rock rip-off or whatever it was. Since then, there have been major downsides (Iraq, 2004), but in case I didn't get ready - this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series on which it was to be based.
