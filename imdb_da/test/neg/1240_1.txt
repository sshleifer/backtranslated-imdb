Did the authors tell people to come up here and write positive reviews? I really mean it's a little hackneyed, and Spike isn't that fun. He seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be fun. There are so many mediocre recordings in this show; As once, the opening talk "Talk show, applies directly to the forehead", again and again. And another that presented Spike and another guy was tall and it wasn't even fun. They didn't even do anything but sit and laugh, over and over again. Ha Ha! And another who presented Spike, who spoke to a Korean guy who ate ducks and told him he had a pet sand. Ha ha! I really mean Spike gets just fun guests at his show, that's why people like this show
