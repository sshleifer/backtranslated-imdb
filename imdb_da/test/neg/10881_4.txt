Continuing in the string of "stalker / slasher" flicks in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride," etc., comes "Rest Stop." The most unoriginal and useless of them all. <br /> <br /> We start, pretty promising, with a beautiful young girl's violent death in a bad toilet. <br /> <br /> This is where our interest is lost. We then move to the clich√© road trip couple, heading for LA with their eyes on scenarios. . . As with making movies like this, they will never reach. <br /> <br /> The couple in the park runs the couple and argues all the way to an abandoned and disgusting resting place for the girl to use the bathroom. Harmless enough until she goes out and finds her girlfriend missed and realizes that she is spoiled by a lame version of "Joy Ride "'s Rusty Nail. . . Only drive around in Mater from "Cars". Honestly, if it had been instructed / written / produced / acted by someone else, it could have been pretty good. But no. Because then comes the ghost story. Yup. . . You guessed it. Lots of "Oh, I help you, but wait, you're dead" to "Wait, is this stalker a person, a monster or a ghost?". <br /> <br /> But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? The one Lawerence brother. Excellent. We're saved. (sarcasm) Oh wait, no, we are not. <br /> <br /> You know. . . If you want to laugh a little or if you get free rentals like I do, try it. <br /> <br /> If you want, you learn how to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
