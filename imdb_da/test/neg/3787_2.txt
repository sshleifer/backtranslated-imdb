Pretty terrible, but not completely unmatched. Another review mentioned "predictable" - and that is almost an understatement. You can make a game without guessing what the next line will be. Each character is either stereotypical or archetypal. The good guy in a bad situation, the struggle between the elderly and the younger priest about acceptance and discipline, the oppressed, sexually / emotionally deprived woman, returning to the small town, having failed in the big city, engaged in the head, weak minded beau from the youth, the impenetrable evil boys, two "lost boys" looking for a sense of family - they are all here and none of them with even the farthest spin of something new. From the first few minutes you can find out what happens to the end of the movie. The story is not entirely paralyzed, but direction, action (even from a throw of a talent) is all thrown together without ability. As for history, we have all seen it before in a movie called "Sister Act". This is also one of the films in which inattention to small details emerges in an even more brilliant light. (For example, the nurse and our hero drive into the city, but park several blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store) - but both cross empty parking spaces for no apparent reason, or in the morning until evening under a scene that seems to be occur for a maximum of half an hour, the film is filled with such things and then tags on an unlikely breakdown.
