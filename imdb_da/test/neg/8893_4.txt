This movie came very close to being a good flick. The direction should be a little smoother to move from one piece to the next to make it more plausible. Especially: The protagonist's need to escape is not explicit enough. Does he try to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? His life does not seem to be so bad, so it makes it harder to swallow that he will leave his life so much. It is also not clear how much "in love" he has fallen with Jennifer Jason L. If the film was reworked with more attention to these details, it would have been fantastic. On the other hand, it's quite good for an indy flick! Maybe if you have a few drinks to stupid the logical thinking, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
