There is something exciting about disaster films. The simple primary premise can lead to more good stories. Permitted, most disaster movies tend to explore the known area instead, but I can usually live with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood probably marks the lowest point in this subgenre's history. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, although the screen time is divided between different places and characters. He hardly gives a decent performance. Joanne Whalley is also very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played in Doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. I mean, his timing is completely out of the way, and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassing achievement for that man. The rest of the cast varies from decent to really bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, which I thought might be there as a plot unit / eyeshadow, by far the most compelling performance. It doesn't mean much to consider how bad everyone else is, but it's still fun to see that she cared. <br /> <br /> Scripture is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worse lines I've heard for some time are delivered by the actors one after the other. You've seen this story a thousand times. It uses all the dramatic crocodiles you've seen in "Outbreak", "Armageddon", the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. The direction is horrible. No sense of timing, nothing inspired. The shoots are boring, dialogue and action both fail. Editing is bad, but how do you edit such a root? Without a doubt, this movie tried to rely too much on (rather bad) CGI. The human factor, drama and the struggles of the characters are shining. Scenes where the characters are actually facing the flood are rare and poorly finished. The TV mood gives nausea. Any guy going down on a rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor rock / edit job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious way. <br /> <br /> The movie score is rather poor. Everywhere, no timing. The end is probably the worse I have seen for some time. Much like they ran out of ideas. Scrap it, you can't run out of anything if you've never had it in the first place. Perhaps the budget has run out. <br /> <br /> This is a real amateur job. I give it a 2 to use London as a location, which is a nice change, because Gilsig is actually decent in a key supporting role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on London and the gates) . <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and check out day after morning or almost any disaster movie before this. This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.
