It is great to hear the 3 or so comments that point to what 'Footballers Wives' mean for women. The title alone flushes out any suspected equality women have in the media industry or society, and reduces them to two-dimensional comic strips of how men think women should behave. It's a postmodern moronic farce. It might as well be called 'soccer players Wifey, who stays at home and knows her place'. On the one hand, it may actually be a kind of parody of Britain's presentation of boy waste by celebrities and their role in maintaining a patriarchal society. So women can undermine stereotypes by acting as the stereotypes and owning the image created for them by the human desire. Nah, it would be ironic and wise. I also sound like I should praise it. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is simply camp and over the top to be taken seriously. Like an even cheaper Cruella De Ville. She just needs some maniacal, discouraging, but at the same time she estimates herself to show her true performance. Oh she does? Right. Yet it is only about summing up where this is aimed. Either 'wise wise' journos, who think it's a harrowing send-up of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think it's "right". "Finest actors"? OMG !! Stop seeing this afterwards of a pantomime and get a life. It is quite sexist and is of such low quality that perhaps those who enjoy it think they are "in" on "joke". Should the actors really care about or understand what they communicate? It is so dull for women and men. They are not all self-centered, selfish, soccer-loving materialistic jerks who believe women are nothing more than another trophy to be exhibited to the public. It's so humiliating. I am sure that Mrs Lucker could easily stand up for them in her "real" life and twist them around her finger as easily done in 'Footballers Wives'. <br /> <br /> Of course it doesn't really matter. I mean only a T.V. program. So please let it be combed. It is terrible and will only be looked back in the same disbelief that 'Prisoner Cell Block H' was so happy to remember. <br /> <br /> How did it come about? It's probably not subtle or complex. It can only come from the same mind that reads the FHM magazine and thinks it is "okay" to look at soft porn and "do" so many women who bow to their will and chant patriotic and racist comments when "their "football team loss / winner. It's totally crass.
