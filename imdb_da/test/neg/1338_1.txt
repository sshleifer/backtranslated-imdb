None! No no no! My whole being is outrageous at this terrible remake of a classic movie. I knew we were going to trouble from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with his ridiculous hair and clothes - which literally looked like a scarecrow in the garden she dug. Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan - how tiring it is! And it got worse ... so much worse. The horribly clich√© lines, the stock characters, the rising sensation, I saw a spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it feels like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh about it. For shame!
