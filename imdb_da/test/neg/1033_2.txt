I love documentaries. Andy Goldsworthy doc was great.I looked forward to this one - but was very disappointed. I knew about Kahn and was fascinated by the idea of ​​his lonely death in a Penn Station men's room. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believed. The only story here is unfortunately deceived women who had affair with a nasty little famous married man. In the absence of anything as an explanation for this guy's terrible behavior, we get infinite repetitive clips of Kahn walking around and painfully long - seemingly contemplative - shot of his soulful buildings. As an example, some of the buildings are interesting, but the focus of the film asks us to think about the guy himself. The overwhelmed soundtrack refers to an emotional tug that is completely absent from the movie. Kahn's apparent gifts do not apologize for his behavior or martyr's mistresses. This movie seems to give the free artist of the great artist Kahn and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic characters - I don't buy it.
