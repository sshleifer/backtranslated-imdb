I was thrilled with the fresh (word play) synopsis of this movie and am looking forward to seeing it. The first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place; gardening awards. The movie looks great. Colorful yet simple. Magical yet genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to find out where the movie will go. We quickly expect that this will be a manipulative, juicy tale that illustrates a bunch of cheated people standing in their way confronted with "nice victimized" refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the needy people experience the error in their paths and accept these people. <br /> <br /> The characters, especially the prejudices, are very "comic-booky" in nature. The story focuses primarily on two refugee families. One of them is led by a single mother who is terribly played by Diveen Henry. I'm sorry to say that any feeling that could have been felt against her struggle was defeated by what was memorably bad acting. The second story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. Everyone is scared of their journey to this country in the form of containers where wife and mother died, but it is the man who suffers the most. Benedict Wong gives a mindset here. Initially, his emotions are very subdued, but when the story unfolds, he subtly reminds us of his character's inner struggle. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just extremely boring. There were so many options with this movie. There are several signs to keep track of, many of which may have potential, but none of them are realized. Even worse, despite the fact that this movie is not very Hollywoodian, some of the most important plot threads are resolved cheaply in a Hollywood b-grade way. Example: <br /> <br /> Grade A likes character B Grade B rejects his progress No problem! Let's have character C declares her love for character A so we can all get a good ending. Yawn. <br /> <br /> I really liked the Asian family's plot thread. It was well done. Unfortunately, the entire allocation business, the common aspect of it, is the dynamic one that involves a large cast, all under exploitation. What you are left with is a movie that has little value.
