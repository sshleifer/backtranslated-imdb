In most parts, Naach is about this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali), who considers herself a kind of author, in addition to the petty commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor beau (Abhishek Bachchan) are building their careers. Good idea, it only turns out that she has the most immensely bad concepts of costumes and dance movements, things that are rotten enough to make even the strength of these ultra-cheap South Indian potboilers choke in severe embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The story follows a yawning inducing predictable pattern ... dances and beau meet and have an affair (yes, included sex) ... beau becomes successful, but she spurns his attempts to help her .. .beau throws attitude and they go together ... the dancer meets a most unlikely instructor who wants her "to do what she wants" ... incongruous stakes even more unnoticed popularity ... beaus attempts to reach out is rebuffed until a climax where he bursts out how he can't live without her ... D-uh than. <br /> In fact, I didn't really expect this movie to be very good. So why did I see it? Because I have an Antara Mali fetish. She is an actress with IMO enough talent to reach high altitudes, provided she has the opportunity. Unfortunately, her role in the movie looks much better on paper than in real life, ironic for a movie that should be about an uncompromising character. To give her credit she puts in a game effort that shines well in the few scenes that actually ask for her as an actress. I just wished the movie had been more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws in a few good strokes, the last scene saved something by a simmering trip that pleasantly reminds you of his father. <br /> <br /> Only recommended if you can sit through the humongous piles of doggie to return a few grains of good moments courtesy leading actors.
