In the opening series of "Where's Poppa?" As George Segal rises from her bed one morning, shaves, shower, puts on a gorilla, and enters her mother's bedroom, we later realize that giving her a massive heart attack will kill her and get her out of her life forever. It's about the level of humor one can expect from most of this image: mental illness mixed with what can be taken as morbid bold. Segal plays a New York lawyer who lives with his suspected senile mother (Ruth Gordon) whose life is further complicated when he hires a nurse to look after the old bag, meets the dream girl, the pleasant primary Trish Van Devere, decorated like Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate the lovely nurse in his and his annoying mother's life. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is all about keeping the picture together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic timing are almost infinite (what happened to that guy?); where the film fails is in other areas. Ruth Gordon's characterization is horrible as the mother. In the beginning, you can't figure out if her character is senile or just deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out. At the end, it is clear that she is just nuts. When Segal brings Van Devere home to meet her, Gordon's eyebrows go and she gets an average scary look. She will have removed the intruder in her son's life; she calculates This is not a senile person. You do not get a consistent performance throughout the image, which is probably the director's (Carl Reiner) mistake as much as Gordon's. Ruth Gordon's old "Rosemary Baby" lady is much more successful because the kind of intoxicating, cloying person Ruth Gordon generally plays, reacts to the audience as annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too shameful to fight back, Gordon becomes more cloying, her fangs dig deeper and deeper, and we are afraid of Farrow; This kind of introduction is really scary. Here we are asked to laugh at what we usually find annoying, and if Gordon played it as helplessly close all the way, we can. But she is selfish and also means, and it dampens the little humor there is. <br /> <br /> There are, however, a few good laughs. A courtroom scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counter-culture punk is quite fun, and Vincent Gardenia makes a good trip as a Lombardiesque football coach. There is also an inspired piece where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman) has been stripped naked by muggers heading to Segal's place, asking him to carry home - and he gives him the gorilla blanket. <br /> <br /> But much of the script is poorly thought out and doesn't make sense. Why is a New York lawyer with his own practice at home in the first place? Why does Segal, if his mother is senile, try to log with her logically: "If you pamper this for me, then I'll beat your fat heart." Why does Liebman continue to cut through the park if he knows he is being hit? Why does he take a taxi after leaving Segal with a gorilla suit? Why didn't he take a taxi all the time? A fun piece would have been Liebman, like the gorilla, terrorizing the mugs. Why does Van Devere hold back - after her first husband was a cook, why would she get involved in this bunch? I suppose if I put this to Carl Reiner, he would say, "It's crazy people they don't have to make sense." Which is a convenient way to apologize for a miserable script filled with holes. The character's immediate behavior may not have to make sense, but their motivations do, and this is where "Where's Poppa?" fall apart; The situations are created just for having gag, and gags are mostly one-shot, they don't build on anything. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty of all this failure. How he has acquired this shelf reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzle me; Basically, his career has been holding a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while talking in fun voices. His son Rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as an instructor. In show-biz terms, Reiner pushes buttons; a monkey could do his job. And this is most evident in his framing of the action. Why is the whole of New York shot tight and in close-ups, but the scenes in the country are distant and panoramic? It is the mentality of Carl Reiner's direction, claustrophobic for the city, spatial for the country. In the last lunatic scene on the old home, the camera is so far away, you can't even figure out what's going on. The sudden end suggests a resolution that Segal could have reached ninety minutes ago; It also suggests that Reiner couldn't figure out how to finish the picture. Then he just cut it like another example of "madness". Reiner seems to think that stupid means craziness, and craziness without logic is always fun. It is not, and the creators of "Where's Poppa" are as demented as Ruth Gordon puts Pepsi in his cuttings.
