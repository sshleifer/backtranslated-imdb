Terrible adaptation of Heminway's low key love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during World War I. What's wrong with this? Almost everything. Hudson is way out of his depth here. He could be a good actor, but not in this movie. Jones is too old for her role (she is 21 in the book - here she is 38 ... and sees it!). Also, her plays woke up between overdone and underdone! They took a simple low-key love story and blasted it all out of proportion. The movie is poorly long (just over 150 minutes), self-sufficient and padded to a ridiculous degree. It seems that the producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing "Gone With the Wind" again. Some of the scenery is really stunning (even on a small TV screen), but there's not enough story to match the pictures. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end, where Jones dies, must be tragic, but the bad actors and over-blown theater fights made me struggle not to laugh! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse actor Vittorio De Sica overcomes a really embarrassing degree. Overblown, self-indulgent, poorly cast and slow. Pretty awful. This was (understandably) an economic and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You may be able to set some of the scenery at the end, but it's really not worth it. I give this a 3.
