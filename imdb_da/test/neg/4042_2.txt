Words cannot express how poor this film is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the play is terrible, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> With a maturity of 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes too long. It might have been OK as a short sketch on a comedy show, but the premise is far too thin to work in the time without the boredom kicking in. </ br /> Avoid this one, clean a good movie instead!
