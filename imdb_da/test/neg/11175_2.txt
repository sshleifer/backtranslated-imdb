Ring! Ring! Have been horror director hotline, how can we help you? About ?? Yes ?? Pronto! I mean hi, my name is Rugge ?? error, call me at my initials R.D! Okay, Mr R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well the reviews on my latest movie "Dial: Help" were all negative and hard, and of course I think my career has also seen better days. Okay, Mr R.D, and why do you think it is? Well, I have gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking films about missing tribes of cannibals that devour a movie crew member and another on relentless slippers who terrorize wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park for which I borrowed the idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" is about ?? err ?? Forget it! No no, Mr R.D, go ahead and tell me what the movie is about. Um, it's about a spiritually possessed phone line that stalks a sexy model and kills the people who surround her. Ah I understand. This assumption actually sounds a little stupid and not as terrible as cannibals or rapes, but I suppose there are deeper themes in your movie, right? Oh yes, sure? Um, what do you mean by that? Well, isn't that the phone line's symbolism for another form of terror? Or maybe it only happens in your woman's heroine? Um, no ?? It's just a phone that goes crazy and kills people with the lead, vibration, electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr R.D, but how do you explain all these supernatural things to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I figured that the slow-tearing phone-mystery plot would not be as important or relevant, so I just focused on dealing with all the possible phoneimmicks I could think of. Phone gimmicks? What do you mean? You know, as the wind is blowing through the horn, thought-through ringtones, and turntables are catapulting in the air! Very original, Mr R.D, but not exactly horrible, and as an experienced director you must know that ultimately people expect a fair clarification of all these events. Oh, but there is! It all has to do with negative and unpublished energy if I remember correctly! It's a little weak I admit. Hmm ?? I see. Oh, as they always say, is a good movie based on more elements than just the story. Have you at least treated some of your common brands in the movie, so your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! Lord I know tried, but murder and bloodshed are simply not shocking! It's a shame, Mr R.D, but what about sex? Everyone likes a good deal of sleaze and nudity in their horror movie, and you said yourself the movie centered on a sexy fashion model at risk! But ?? But what, Mr R.D? Well, to tell you the truth, we have kind of promoted "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with revealing plays by Charlotte Lewis on the cover, but in reality there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R. D! Now I'm really disappointed, it's just shamelessly tearing people away and luring them with false promises! I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to rent "Dial: Help" and love it! Well, to roll up I can comfort you by saying that every director is entitled to some erroneous decisions without affecting his / her career immediately, but be careful next time and do some research first, okay Mr R.D? I will; thank you! You're welcome. Tell me, do you already have ideas for upcoming movies already? Yes, I actually do! I was thinking of making a Giallo with a murderous washing machine! Doesn't that sound so fascinating? Hi? Hi?
