Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and use the film to bend their way back to true love. It doesn't have much reputation and it's easy to see why. The jokes are known from better movies, but they do not gel here. And the leaders are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is cut and starchy, and it's double sad to believe she was dead just a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know he's in a sow's ear and tries his fate to make a silk bag outside it without great success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "the other man" (he has a nice drunk scene). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock movies.
