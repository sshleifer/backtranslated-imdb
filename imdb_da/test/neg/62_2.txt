Humm, an Italian starred movie by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I didn't expect much to be honest and actually I took even less than I expected. This does not mean that this movie is the worst I have seen because I have seen worse things than this, but the plot was confusing and uninteresting most of the times, and some good acting scenes are the only things that save this. Apart from that you will love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I only want to see "Troll 3" by the same director, so it won't get any worse than that.
