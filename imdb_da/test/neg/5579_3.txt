From the meteor's initial shot falls to the ground, you know you're in something special. <br /> <br /> This is an ultra-low budget shot of a video about a group of teenagers stranded on a lighthouse with some monsters. The story is unremarkable and nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before. The action is not great, but is not quite horrible, but the special effects - where there is a good deal - are at best ridiculous. In fact, if you can read this sentence, chances are better than 50%, so you can do a more credible job that creates the video explosion and compositional effects of this movie than the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The movie's saving grace - If you're in the mood for a class Z turkey of a movie - there's always something going on and it never gets boring. And if you like to make fun of bad movies with your friends, just find it worthwhile to rent in dollars. <br /> <br /> And I must say I appreciated the opening forest, "it's the stupid name on an island I've ever heard." Probably the best moment in the movie.
