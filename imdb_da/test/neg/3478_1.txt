Plankton or Creatures from the abyss, since I am positive, is the more known as & filmed under as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears over a moving picture and in the same font as the rest of the credits starts with five 20 something kids, Mike (Clay Rogers) his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) & Dorothy (Loren DePalm) & an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decides that everyone fits into a small inflatable boat and head out to sea, ask not why, as I do not know. Oh & the complete idiot Bobby left the gasoline behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as a great surprise that they end up stranding on the ocean without gasoline for the engine and to make matters worse they get caught in a thunderstorm & Discover a dead body floating in the water. Shortly after, their happiness succeeds when they come across a yacht and potential safety, for a moment all the boat controls and begins to explore. First of all, they find a scientific laboratory with various fish samples and computer equipment, so they find fully furnished and luxurious cabins below them. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who appears crazy and cannot speak. They eat fish from the fridge, causing Dorothy to throw up green vomit, beetles and snails. They learn that these fish live the 1000-year-old fossil and have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea and that they fly, mutate, bite and are generally unpleasant to be around. I really can't bother to continue with this interpretation, so I do not want to here is what I think ... This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I would save under a different name if I made a movie here too), and I think Plankton is simply one of the worst movies ever. There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's hard to know where to start. First script by Richard Baumann is totally crap, it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow and boring, it was torture for me to sit through. Why would five people simply sail to the middle of the ocean on a rubber boat just as big enough to fit them all? What did they plan to do exactly? Why do we often get views from these fish creatures, but they seem to be completely invisible to the characters they never appear on the screen, even though they are right next to a sign, and how do these fish get around the boat as there are no is water for them to swim in? People's actions and reactions to things are wrong, they constantly split up, they make bizarre decisions that simply do not make sense in the situation they are in. Part of the dialogue is as horrible as anything I have heard. I could go all day on all the plot holes and ridiculous goings on, but I run out of space if I do. The fish creatures look themselves awful, a mix of gum dolls and some really bad stop motion animations at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human cast also seem to be terrible with a bad super imposition. I've heard many comments saying that Plankton is gory, don't let me laugh! Forget there is almost no blood or gore in Plankton at all, there are a few slimy scenes when Bobby turns into a fish monster while having sex with Julie, but it's pretty short and he doesn't kill her, he's just one kind of drops of slime on her grows a few tentacles and a fish head comes out of the mouth. Later, Julia's vagina begins to drip some dark slime, but that's what we'll never see happening to her or what the mucus is. Dorothy has a fish creature coming out of her back, off screen, and controlling her, but again we never see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very short shot of a plastic harpoon stuck in the forehead. Easily the roughest scene is when Dorothy is snatched up with the green stuff with what looks like beetles and snails in it. That's what only one person actually dies on the screen and for the most part Plankton is rather tame and as exciting as seeing paint dry and I almost fell asleep, it's so boring. I can't see how anyone likes this overall crap, I just can't. The action is horrible, the dubbing is horrible, the characters are awful and I hated them all. Tecnically Plankton is also predictable shit, with an estimated budget of just $ 250,000, all I can say is where did the money go? The sets are monotonous and boring with one laboratory and a few cabins, the special effect being the bottom of the barrel removers, including the most fake lookout boat ever, cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or excitement and as a whole Plankton is like that called name, as low in the food chain as it could be. I hate Plankton, it's terrible in every aspect of it's over 86 minute duration. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac.
