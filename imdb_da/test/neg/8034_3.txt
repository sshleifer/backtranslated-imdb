Riccardo Freda can have a good reputation; but since we now see that many of his best films were actually directed by the late great Mario Bava; It is clear that he was not one of Italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the 70s. This film shows pretty much what despite the simplified plot; It's a sparkling mess, and generally I even have to go as far as to say that the tragic ceremony is WORSE than Freda's insipid Giallo action, The Iguana with Fire Tongue. Freda apparently disowned this movie and I certainly do not guarantee him! The reason simply follows a bunch of children running out of gasoline in the middle of the sky. They happen at a house while they are looking for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice as the owner is performing a satanic ceremony ... ho hum .. The film has a leading role in Camille Keaton, who will continue to steal in the exploit classic I Spit on Your Grave some years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talented artists. The movie has a decent make scene towards the end, but it's really not enough considering that it takes ten minutes of tedium to get there. I have a high tolerance for bad Italian movies that doesn't make sense - but even I couldn't stand here. Miss it, miss nothing!
