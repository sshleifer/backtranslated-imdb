I don't know about the rest of the viewers of this movie, but I'm personally dead and tired of Steven Seagal's movies. When the law came out, it was a great action movie. Wahoo. Now in Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal from the law. I get tired of seeing no sign changes. It's the same character, time and time after time. He needs change. This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. Calling it an action movie gives it almost too much credit because there are too few action scenes and they spread far apart in the whole movie. I guess they wanted to go to some drama, but it was a pointless attempt when the film portrayed nothing but the regular binge-Steven-Seagal, we've seen thousands of times. Getting a new look and losing the pony is all I have to say, I definitely recommend not watching this movie in any form, going out to eat, heck, renting Barney going to Vegas, but under no circumstances renting this movie under that prescription, that Seagal will do a good job.
