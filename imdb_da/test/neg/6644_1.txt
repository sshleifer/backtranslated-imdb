So far, I've never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Poorly traded, poorly planned and racist Neanderthal, took place in Chicago, where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the entrance into it - "No Leaves Without Singing the Blues - was as stupid as a record. The kids her character was childcare was inadequate and well before the end of the movie I would want something terrible to happen to all of them. <br /> <br /> I have to say, however, that there is a special thing about this movie; a movie to offend me, but this crumbling piece of tripe did what Chopper, Phantom Menace and Catwoman couldn't do - make me sick in my stomach.
