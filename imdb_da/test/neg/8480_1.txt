There was no need for this movie, clean and simple. The original, though hated by some, was something I thought was really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started losing his touch, and Cameron Diaz was good, "Smoooooookin!" "Nuff said. So why do a sequel / prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do that should have been clue enough that it doesn't deserve to be created. But then they just make a mistake after a mistake "Jamie Kennedy. Why does this man still get the weather? The scripture and the story: horrible. Why do I ever want to see a baby wearing the mask? Besides, why do I want to see it fly? Ever? How did anyone think it was a good idea?" The action is despicable, in fact, almost everything about this movie. I try to keep myself quiet, or IMDb will probably not let me send this. Bottom line: Don't see this piece of waste. Pick up the original, see how well Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey used to have a career and laugh, don't waste another moment of your time on this.
