Not well done at all, the whole movie was just Grudge around and killed random people out of nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with the story are killed, like the 3 school girls, for example. The family in the beginning has nothing to do with the story either, I think they are random families who never went to the house and never had anything to do with the Grudge killings. <br /> <br /> Not impressed by me, I wasn't scared, I didn't jump at any part and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money out of. Goes Gridge 1 also like a tease, which was actually a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think The Grudge 2 is like a leading movie to The Grudge 3 if they ever make one. They should not have called this Grudge 2 themselves, they should call it prolet to Grudge 2, and you will see if you saw it, for I will not destroy anything. Not that it would have any significance. <br /> <br /> 1/10, not scary, bad story, and just random.
