I bought this movie on DVD despite the "obsolete" review and it was idiotic ... This review was accurate and I have never seen any worse "erotic" movies in my long life! Even though it was partly nice filmed and had interesting surroundings, plus a good cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica (c) movies are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times this movie budget ! The story has no logical connection with the first movie or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) element of slave education, except some very strange and sad developments ... So the most important male character - Klaus Kinski - did not like that another master of "O" he is trying to play ... And not even lovely Arielle Dombasle, looked delicious in every scene!
