The amount of hype and the tremendous success this movie has made is evidence of how desperate our people are towards a good independent Saudi movie. In fact, the great success of "Tash ma Tash" is also a proof. I'm not going to start with how important filmmaking is, as it is obvious to those with half a brain how movies have changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I don't want to say how much our community needs a bunch of movies to clear out many problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many many more. At the same time, news about the fist-Saudi film came, which should have been a means of some of the problems we have, especially against the youth. Instead, we saw a bald movie for that matter. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and naivety of the scripture were obvious. It was as if a 13 year old had written it. <br /> <br /> Now I've heard that the budget for this movie was huge. I want to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, editing was poor. The scripture was "kharabeet". You really don't know what the story is and what the director's purpose is from this movie. <br /> <br /> A note about the actor playing the religious brother, his performance was good, but with poor direction. Another thing about the role of the religious friends he had is not how religious guys work here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "evil" as this film intends. In fact, they are some of the best people you will ever meet with some truly unusual ways of living, and that is what should have been in the movie. <br /> <br /> The youth follow the religious here because of a reason, and it is the young people who are most passionate and sentimental. And with the well-formed principles on which religious people live, young people follow them. Again, that's what should have appeared. <br /> <br /> We need another "First Film" with a Saudi writer, actor, director, composer, even cameraman. So they all work with passion for their experiment, not just for the money! <br /> <br /> And we have to do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include phrases from the Koran in the script of the movie. As people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge faced by a Saudi film producer is changing the mentality of that angle.
