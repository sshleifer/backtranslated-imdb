I was looking forward to this flick. Being an old Robert E Howard fan, mostly from a Conan stand. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much and thought they couldn't ruin it too much .... Oh dear - how wrong were I ... <br /> <br /> mistake was it was pretty boring. It was necessary to zip along with a good help of supernatural goose-on, sword fighting and the like. <br /> <br /> You got a little bit of fun, but everything else was just lifeless. The middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horse-drawn carriages and even slower dialogue and character development! <br /> <br /> On the plus side = Costumes and effects were fine, but not enough to keep your interest. I think it would have been better to tone down the gore, up the pace, and go to a 12A rating. As a ten-year-old boy, I like this movie. Probably about age I was first reading the Conan stories that were funny enough. Maybe it says a lot about my expectation of the movie? <br /> <br /> Or ....... Go really "Art-House" with tone, direction, etc. But it's pretty high risk as far as Box Office is concerned. <br /> <br /> Oh yes .... Maybe the next Conan movie will do it?
