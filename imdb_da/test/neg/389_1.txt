This movie features 2 well-known actors I have previously enjoyed watching. There actions are great, and every action is the heart felt. But it makes me think that these 2 were thrown into a college speech / drama class for the first time and told that one should act dominantly and narrow down to the other in a room without letting her go and the woman really be innocent and Treat her with enough mind-humping to run the audience in tears for her release. The only good part is the working ability, the plot has the same ruse as Hitler's influence, and I began to hate the main character to. But all this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion, so pulling it out for over an hour was just plain punishment for anyone who saw it. <br /> <br />
