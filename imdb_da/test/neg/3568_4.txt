For me, this movie is essentially an episode of feature length for a television series. It reminds me especially of the British remake of the TV series Wallander starring Kenneth Brannagh. People interviewed by the police are stubborn, and often as bitter as the weather, the main researcher has huge family problems. Investigations inevitably lead to atrocities from the distant past, and the plot is labyrinthine with strange events and subplots only make sense at the end. Both have excellent filmography. <br /> <br /> The plot of Jar City reminiscent of a standard British or American crime series. Effectively, you can plot any of the episodes of Touch of Frost and transplant them onto the gloomy locale of this movie and have an effective sequel. <br /> <br /> The actual script could not be clearer from the cookie cutter. You get even the most well-known motifs, such as. Local Prison Police to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. I am convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk music, but I feel it is necessary to point to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television. What I felt was a great lack of message. The theme of the film is genetic studies in Iceland. Specifics in genetic terms are largely isolated from the outside world and provide a great opportunity for researchers to study their genetics. Lots of information on the heredity of the population has been kept, and many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has rejected interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to put together a puzzle of London underground cards, instead of a puzzle of a daisy field). A company called deCODE genetics tried to create a database of all genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. Due to privacy, this project has been completed, and at the end of last year, deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. The episode is a rich topic for debate. <br /> <br /> But in this movie, genetics and medical science are not there for the sake of education, they are there for strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It is a grisly movie if you are interested in it, and there is often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch in between cuts. The most boring for me was when the chief inspector devoured a sheep's head. Unfortunately for me this was occasionally farcical. The film attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the pig with the sentimental and ended up giving inadvertent humor towards the end. This is the equivalent, in a cinematic way, of trying to prepare fugu, if you are not qualified, handful and sharp in the eye, you poison the client. This rather novice director should have lowered the rate for his performance. <br /> <br /> I went out of this movie that felt pretty bad about myself and about life in general.
