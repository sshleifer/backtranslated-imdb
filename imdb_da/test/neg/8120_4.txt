Horrible movie about a doctor fishing and winning up with a mermaid when thrown overboard. She traps him to bring her back with him. <br /> <br /> In the title role, Glynis Johns is really a stupid individual with a tail hanging out. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who should be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedies. <br /> <br /> It was great to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He would come with John's in the far better "Mary Poppins", 16 years later. <br /> <br /> Miranda causes rudeness that two boys, a neighbor's fianc√© and driver (Tomlinson) fall for her. <Br /> <br /> Ask a mermaid to see what is the best tuna chicken of the sea! What about this movie, forget it.
