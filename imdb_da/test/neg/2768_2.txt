I couldn't make heads or tails out of this horrible movie noir. <br /> <br /> The reason was confusing, the actor was okay, but the picture quality was horrible! Although I bought this on a "Ganster's Double Pack" (8 films on two discs) at Walmart for $ 5.50, and when you insert the DVD, apologize for the horrible picture quality some of the movies may have. <br /> The plot was flip flopping everywhere, I couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on ... so "The End" appeared and the movie was over. <br /> <br /> What's a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I'm not wasting your money or time on this! Or if you also bought the Gansters Double Pack then just jump over this one ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
