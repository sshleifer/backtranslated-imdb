Kite Runner began as one of the "important" films that most people go over because they are told they should be if they want to be among the elite and quickly fall into an idiotic movie of absurdly obscure proportions. <br /> <br /> I never read the book and never felt the need because I honestly don't care. Sure I am called uninformed to say so, but I really have no interest whatsoever in just another "trait of your heart strokes, copies of all other stories to get the feelings of readers' novel" even though it is set in Afghanistan . <br /> <br /> That said, I saw the movie. I heard good things about his beauty and how touched it was and decided why not? As it turns out, there was a very good reason why not. Not only was the so-called protagonist completely unsympathetic (I understand it, he was young, and it is a film about redemption, but honestly he was horrible. I hated him and not in the good 'Anti-hero' way he was just one dull, idiotic, self-absorbed character, which I did not mind, but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I could not believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was and how they were crying and it moved them. I'm sorry, but I just feel moved by something that feels realistic, Sci-Fi has been known to move me too, fantasy ... but this one? Please. This surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity! My biggest peeve, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you didn't just scratch it from a thousand other stories? Positive that the particular lap was not added just to try to pull more tears out of your audience (don't know what kind of people are looking for reasons to cry during a movie)? I rolled my eyes when "twist" was revealed by knowing that it could only go downhill from there (not to mention flashing back to Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "No, it's not true , that's impossible! ") Oh, and it sure did. Full to the brim with clich√©s and just planning stupid storytelling. Like "good guy escaping miraculous bad guy against all odds with the help of spunky kid, who, despite being maliciously sodomized and having no idea who you are, is willing to help with a conveniently placed weapon that has particular importance for you ". Ooh and don't forget it so idiotic "finally get revenge on the child who teased you when you were little, which surprisingly surprise has become a psychopathic adult" (believe me, I understand you would like to live vicariously through movies but it You will never happen. You know the kid who teased you in high school ... He's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to mention CGI tastic kites! I think they were on par with "Matrix" movies and "Transformers" bravo you! BRAVO! <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie is just made for Western audiences who need a reason to worry about the Middle East (hi an overly emotional friendship story will work!) This is one of The most superficial movies I have had the misfortune to see, it is so deeply well ... but when you get right down to it, it is nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of America's audience will do what they 'tell and follow "It's about controversial material, so it must be good!" way of thinking.
