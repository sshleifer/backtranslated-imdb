I have not read this book and based on this adaptation, will not bother. I hated all the characters in this show - Miranda was blunt, selfish and mumbled miserably through the horrible dialogue her sister was a total look, and that was the worst portrayal of manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in psychology and it was not correct. In fact, until it was mentioned, I didn't realize that Troy was supposed to be a bipolar - I thought he was a normal, somewhat grumpy teenager. The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliant psychotic performance was the only thing that made me see the other half. <br /> <br /> Obviously, authors and producers of this show have not done any research - Troy's mental problems are not far-right, nor are the forensics involved in the "twist" end (and if you don't have seen it as a kilometer away, you are a great ole dummy!) <br /> <br /> Exfoliate garbage.
