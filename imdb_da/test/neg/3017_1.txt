yes .. that's what the station's disclaimer says after the advertisements for this show "some scenes may interfere with some viewers". <br /> <br /> It's without disturbance. The validation of this whole display of ego framing and chauvinism is that it is on the COMEDY channel. Yes .. a comedy really true. A JOKE. To see these 'playas' going through their rigid charade really spells out what's wrong with society. Especially the meat market bar scene. Both sides, both men and women, are just as weak and desperate to interfere in this superficial atmosphere. The club is, of course, one of the cigarette corps sponsored plastic coke scenes. These people have a choice and that is what makes it even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> These smart ricks are trying too hard. They glitter with their own groove fat. It is OK. It is a video tape lesson for the new generation of how NOT to focus on a potential heart interest. Hopefully, the facade will crumble with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is who is lined up after these characters fade? The Bastard kids in one night stand?
