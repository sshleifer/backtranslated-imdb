I saw this movie with some kind of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog caught in the headlights. There is no doubt that (although you enjoyed it) it is a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good casting; it is lively; It is ready to tackle the sex head, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers have also agreed, but they have had their moments earlier. <br /> <br /> What it lacks is primarily charm. The characters are impossible idiotic, incredible and alienating, so instead of a movie of men having bad, the manufacturers have made Game On. Any mediocre writer wishing to make a film about the sexual attitudes of stupid, sexist British men would have gotten a few copies of Loaded, Zoo or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist and that would have written himself. Instead, manufacturers clearly tried to make some moronic, difficult to care for, signs. Drawing comedy - unlike slapstick, etc. - works only if the audience can recognize some human truth to the situation. But looking at this movie is like being told an annoying joke that you know isn't going to end up being fun, but you can't stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is also poorly made. The plot structure is weak, there is little character delimitation or development, and many of the scenes are not fun. Time after time, the same lame reggae jumps into sharing scenes, meaningless and gritty. There are many unnecessary repetitions - once you have made a joke about parking outside a sex party, you don't have to do it again. One wonders what the UK Film Council saw in the script. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are rake and most women are constantly up to it. The apartment and Alfie satirized the same world picture very much, but the producers of this movie accepted it without criticism. Thus, they have completed some sort of subordinate update of Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Someone British should have another go on this kind of thing and do it properly ?? a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I think ...
