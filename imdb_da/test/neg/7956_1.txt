Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and a host of other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because they love to exhibit India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta still makes her money from it. Anyway Hindus are too gentle or afraid to protest against the way Muslims protest, so anyone can take any liberties with Hinduism. And it is a fact that women in the west of the 1930s were also treated when they were widowed ... just that no one likes to point out anything bad about the West or anything other than India and Hindus. She paints an incorrect portrayal of India and the situation of widows there. Nothing is mentioned that child marriage is illegal. She finished the film and said there are 34 million widows in India. Of course, among a billion people there will be so many widows. But how many lives the life she has portrayed in the film ?? Deepa Mehta finally sells India and poverty to make dollars. How pathetic ....
