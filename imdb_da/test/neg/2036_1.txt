There is a reason to call this a teenage girl. Out of 100 possible points I would put it somewhere in teens. It is predictable that the play is terrible, especially the minor roles, and above all, it is super predictable. The end is so hokey that I should have left early and maybe it would have gone. By the way, can you call the male lead a pervert? I bet it really happened that someone in my school district would have said it. Finally at school I grew up even though the middle class had over 1000 students, we could have chosen a chump as Josie as being scam and we would have designated her out of the crowd. My last word is to save your time when it comes to TV watching something better, just like the stock exchange listing.
