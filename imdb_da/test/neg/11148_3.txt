I felt the movie was rushing and the actor was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the maid was stupid and the guy who played the devil was horrible. The story was confusing and idiotic. The movie had no meaning and was incredible. The movie is not the worst movie but is not too far away from it. Overall I was terribly disappointed it could have been much better. My score is a 3 out of 10
