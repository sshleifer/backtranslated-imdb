The Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had not yet discovered, and I was less than half overwhelmed. The French title "La Cinqui√®me colonne" (the fifth column, a very evocative sentence for underground spies and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high, as did the images of the finale on top of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> Basically, Saboteur is as easy as the 39 steps (note this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin's title), but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are a bit down to earth) And it's certainly not that fast pace. As a chase movie across the US from LA to NY, Saboteur pulls his feet from sequence to sequence. The sequence of the villain lovely ranch? Lovely ranch, nice villain but pretty tame on it all, it doesn't really add anything. The meeting with the blind man, the mix with the circus people, the Soda City sequence, the NY wave sequence? They fall flat and bring in more characters with very little extra voltage value. One major problem I can point out is the relationship between the leaders Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who are not based on Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in the 39 steps. Therefore, the entire narrative structure is fluid depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us closer to the end, as it is not clear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the sudden sabotage. In the 39 steps, it was clearly written as 1 / escape from the police (so you know the hero can't just go to the police) so 2 / runs for his life and for the villain to prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock from the 40's of war era propaganda, I'd recommend choosing a foreign correspondent over the Saboteur. They are both chase movies with a catchy finale, and it really is a gripping and not just sightseeing in the Foreign Correspondant as well as beautifully effective scenes (the amount of umbrella, the tulip fields, the strange mills ...).
