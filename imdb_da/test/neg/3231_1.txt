I could not agree more. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels, and this film is a total travesty. I saw about half of it so threw the tape in the box in disgust! I have no idea what the idiotic instructor was thinking of doing this shot, but I'd rather point my eyes with a sharp stick than see this useless movie again! Everything about this movie is just wrong. First, the protagonist has changed from a former marine to a high school KID. WHY??? Secondly, the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! I certainly bet Freud would have something to say about it! LAUGH OUT LOUD. The dog is sweet enough and the best thing in the movie and completely wiped out everyone else! Also a protagonist who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie. There is really nothing good to say about the film, except that it is at least relatively short in an hour and a half. If someone hasn't seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's so much better than this worthless waste of time!
