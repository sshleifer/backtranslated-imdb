It amazes me that someone would find Pauly Shore entertaining: he is basically a joke that becomes obsolete * really * fast. He has his little "California" jigsaw vocabulary and a basic stock of lame jokes. Mostly he is just pitiful. <br /> <br /> It was said I saw this movie because I was sick and there was literally nothing but infomercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the movie could have been ok if Pauly could just have turned off his spiel and just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you're not a Pauly fan, stay away from this fertilizer chain. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment after seeing another user actually gave this movie a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I gave it 3/10 because they didn't have any mike-in-frame shots, didn't drop the camera and the support was pretty good.
