Sebastian Cole's adventure is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who wants to become an author at a time when he actually puts it into action. This film is probably the years when he gets his material to write, the fairy tales, thus the title and the previous quote. In this we experience the very typical upcoming stories and warnings about love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a little twist here, it is very interesting, and that is why Sebastian's father-in-law (Clark Gregg) makes a serious decision very early to get a sex change that has a great influence on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his steps. -deed. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's grandfather and is very good in that part, very credible without being over the top, which is a route this movie could have taken quite easily. Fortunately, they didn't. Adrien Grenier, who I am only familiar with from Entourage, is also very good in her role as Sebastian, and together he and Gregg have a good relationship on the screen. It is always exciting to see these guys (?) Relationship as it develops and is truly heartbreaking at times. And that's the best of what this movie has to offer. Unfortunately, it involves some mediocre camera work, direction and filmography. It's not bad, but it's far from being good or memorable at least. The characters are also thinly written, and it is clear that they come from how most bows will blow out. The only truly fascinating character through and through is Clark Gregg's Hank / Henrietta. I have already said that Grenier has worked well, but Sebastian's character is not only engaging, but completely uneven. I honestly do not see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in everything he does. He mops, whines, cheats, lies, and lacks other desires than being a complete slacker. It would be different if he were perhaps a side character or comic relief, but having him as the main focus and being asked to take the character seriously? Move on. <br /> <br /> And I don't really mind this movie, but I just want to say ... Choose another song in all those movies, Hollywood! No more "Where's My Mind" by Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in all other movies! I feel that I could just keep more and more of this movie apart, but in honesty I didn't hear it. I just didn't care about it and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is not a bad or boring movie, it's just not a very good or engaging one either. It is very uneven and the script could have used a lot of work. I suppose the movie should be a loose form to look at a writer's life before he did, and it worked ... if that writer put out pieces of fiction that I didn't want to read.
