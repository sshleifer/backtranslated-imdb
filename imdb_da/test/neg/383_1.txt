What do you do with all the material that does not make the final editing of a movie? You can keep it aside if a director's cut or extended version is released one day. You may be selling something like stock footage to be used in part of another movie. You can just put it in. Or you can collect it, accumulate more and more from each movie you make, and use it to make another movie, not seeing context or meaning. Throw a very primitive skeleton of a story into it and put a number of options (no excuses) into the slot in your celluloid cast-offs. Excuse the sudden indecent character of the plot by framing it all in a horror movie director, and you've got a horrible movie yourself. This can all be done with just a few days of shooting. And idiots like me will waste two hours in their lives and see it. And then come here and try to warn others away. The whole event chain is a great waste of time.
