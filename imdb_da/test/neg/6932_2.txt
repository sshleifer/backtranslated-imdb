I can only guess that this movie was an experiment that celebrated. Years earlier, it would have moved pictures accompanied by music. Later it would have been added sound to the silents. Eventually it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This movie must have been a misunderstood attempt to introduce a new element to the talking image. During all the emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of the dialogue and their inner thoughts are told as they look in the distance or appeal to the camera. This interruption is very painful. Imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the story is drone. Painful. I have no idea who came up with this gimmick, but it was the only time I ever saw it used - and for good reason. In each scene, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, twist their hands or exaggerate to such an extent, I actually wondered if it really was a comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a few generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed in love, is looking for a reason to live. She has a friend who is played by Ralph Morgan who cultivates her - but she takes him for granted. She is attracted to a doctor played by Clark Gable, but he is self-absorbed and is not interested in her. She sits down to a weakness that needs her desperately. She only marries him to find out that there is insanity in her family, and she can never have a baby with him. Further, the doctor, who selfishly pops a bowl in his oven, comes to find out only later that he still loves her. The child builds confidence in her husband, who will be successful, but she realizes that it really is Clark she loves. Confused yet? Forget the rest, just watch a few episodes of "As the World Turns" and it will be quite clear. <br /> <br /> If you're ever forced to watch this movie, get ready for the final scene. The actors' gyrations shamed Harold LLoyd. Don't miss it.
