I remember when "The Love Machine" was first released to theaters. I was only 13 years old, too young to watch the very ballyhooed movie release, but not too old to take my mother's paperback copy of Jacqueline Susann's play to school and pore over the "cheeky bits" with my colleagues. br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age, but I was very much into the book. I bought and wore an "ankh" ring just like on the paper tray, and I remember the advertisements for perfume, "Xanadu", which was shrunk and highlighted lumpy in the film. In spite of such an interest, I did not see the film several years later. I should have left things as they were. "The Love Machine" is down the worst of the many bad films adapted to Susann's novels ... which of course makes the most fun. Its mistakes are many: from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread; its dated, horny (brass instruments, I mean) music score by ersatz Bacharach; the flat, first footage; The boring sexuality - I've never seen bathrobes highlighted so prominently in a movie before. It's like a fetish! When sex, nudity or something blurred are required, a person comes in a blue robe! Very strange, it; and definitely the circus train of horrible 70s fashion species that is on endless screen. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is no shake anyway, but heads over the rest of the casting) is consistently undermined by the jaws she is encouraged to wear. However, the film's main responsibility is the magnificent, stone-like John Philip Law who (sufficiently) Robin Stone, the object of any girl's (and over the top flaming man's photographer's) affection. <br /> <br /> The law is just awful and seems like he was pulled out of the street, gave the pages of the script hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that, but he desperately needs blood transfusion or something. He looks insane and ill throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars. Robin Stone should be a hunk, not a hankie. <br /> <br /> For anyone who finds the movie hard on the road (it's pretty slow in today's standards), I ask you to stick to the climatic "battle scene". Here, Cannon (who balances 23 pounds of teased hair) eventually loses her starchy play and lets herself get rid of the infectious, eerie grin of her and launches a truly memorable free of all that should have become a movie clip highlight now . Trying to compete with the Doll of the Dollar's infamous wig-down-the-toilet scene, "The Love Machine" finally does something right. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Susann's unique brand waste is very much missed. Maybe someone out there has the rights to Rona Barrett's "The Lovomaniacs" and revive the genre.
