You get a great deal of Steven Seagal's environmental concerns, and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes (or alternatively use parts of the remains of the HORSE WHISPERER). You then add a large piece of OUTBREAK virus or the like (attention must be more mortal and at least Biohazard Level 4) wrapped around a bold Militia group leader. You add a teaspoon of martial arts, and a zipper with explosions and shots to taste. Add the classic red Indian herbs for extra flavor. Serve right away. <br /> <br /> What's the movie you get ?: The Patriot. Maybe the worst movie by Steven Seagal. I'm sure Seagal was trying to say something in this movie except for the usual I-a-cook (but-also-ex-seal), but his recipe was confusing and the taste was horrible.
