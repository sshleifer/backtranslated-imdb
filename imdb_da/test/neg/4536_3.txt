Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto, which puts Neoedision and flixer.com (a once promising online movie community) out of service temporarily and out of the net because of his directorial style and method of filming on his next movie GIRL'S BEST FRIEND. <br /> <br /> The Hole suffers from this "look at me, I'm a filmmaker's style of film making that becomes the closest standard in today's Hollywood, to the detriment of the content. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Hole starts out with a unique concept, but the concept and promise of captivating content will soon be destroyed by the "look at me" movie. There are some fun moments that still shine through the sensation, but it is a painful card to see. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when the new breed of "filmmakers" chooses not to serve the story, but rather to try to dominate on and off the screen. Hi, they don't care as long as they get their study agreement, house on the beach and a new car, content and presentation are secondary issues. The real sad part of all this is Hollywood embracing the "look at me" setting so much that the whole aesthetics of movie creation is changing. Instead of presenting a story in a fair way that sets the story first, today's directors get "experimental" ie. "look at me". Is it me or am I the only one who was really put? off at Sena's opening minutes of SWORDFISH. This film continued to rise over Sena's direct attempt at watching me film making. Unfortunately, this short film by Mr. Ishimoto not. 3 out of 10 reviews by Elec Tv.
