The story overall, but quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. The movie was, however, quite horrible. The story was good, but the play was terrible. I cried all the time because I knew I could never get my time spent back. Don't watch this movie. If you do, take a gun with a ball in it and a few balls if you go with friends. I'm sorry for everyone who had something to do with this movie. I'm also sorry for everyone who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs and if your mother forces you to see, kill her. Hahahahaha! See! I'm a psycho now !!!! IKWTCBS made me a psycho !!!!
