I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the breathless gushing of the other comment. I was taken to watch this movie as a child of my ignorant parents, expecting a normal Norman Wisdom jolly romp comedy. Instead, what you get is this brutal British sex comedy of the worst kind, where Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger aiming to get rid of as many "birds" as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly recorded and acted, no portrayal of a manuscript in addition to the worst kind of double player and very vague hints of 'evil'. And all apparently on the particular grainy movie file reserved for the 1960's-1970's UK low-cost movie. About the only memorable thing is the annoyingly captivating theme song that still appears in my brain after 30 odd years. Finally, in the last scene you will see Norman's naked - running over sand and looking frozen. I think so anyway - at that time my mother took me out of the cinema. I saw it again many years later and guess what it was still crooked. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or interested in the little man and his career, apply the "10-foot barole" rule on this. Trust me, you don't have to see Norman Wisdom's backside.
