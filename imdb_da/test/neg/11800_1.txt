I rented this by accident. I raised the video and looked at my back and thought "shameless Blair Witch rip-off". Then I grabbed in a moment with the carelessness 'The Francisville Experiment' that it was something else. My fate of arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more daunting than what this movie had to offer. Drilling Characters, bad acting and a sense of 'we saw the Blair Witch Project and being able to do the same' permeates the action to the point where we look forward quickly, leading you directly to the credits. I'm not the one to film makers to be lazy or desperate, but after this feast I felt the need to warn everyone: Don't waste your time, you have a life.
