"Dolemite" is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation movie titles), an ex-con that probably still has to be in jail. He is in trouble with the police, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. He's just not so happy with a guy. Nor is it the movie, even though it is still fun and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The slender premise is that Dolemite (the game with so much excitement as the star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in prison for a crime he claims he doesn't commit. When a drug is hit or a drug bust or drug is about to go down, the ward releases it to stop it, or help it or just watch it. Not very clear. All I know is that I did not know that the justice system frees prisoners to allow them to prove their own innocence. I ignore my ignorance. <br /> <br /> The ground is unnoticed and insignificant. Basically, Dolemite is about to kill people (usually with very poorly choreographed karate), to have sex and curse people, sometimes even rhyme. The joy of the film is its total incompetence and its total indifference in the matter. I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom as it was in a scene for the whole duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped the question why the manager looked down at where the Dolemite was sitting, even after he got up and walked around as they cut back to the set-up shoot, and Dolemite inexplicably sat down. I stopped and wondered why Dolemite dressed like that when he was naked on the street to change because he wouldn't get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes, gave him prison. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggled his hand on a man's stomach and somehow cut him open. The only time I was ever nervous and excited was when the obnoxious, stupid, white mayor walks around completely naked with nothing but a towel hanging around the neck that just hardly covers him. You keep saying "Cut away ... cut away ... cut away" but when that is the case, you're already emotional. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore as the Dolemite is either fun, cool or both. If you're looking for a bad movie, you've found it with "Dolemite".
