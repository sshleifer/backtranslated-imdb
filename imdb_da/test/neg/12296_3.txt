Yep. Those of my generation who grew up seeing the old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. 80-inch Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television history. Well-written stories, well-developed characters. Granted it was no longer a glorified toy commercial, but it definitely helped carry the toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and entered Valor vs Venom. The animation was at most average. The characters' movement seemed to be shaken and appear like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldier sequel than a story of a special military force. Then we have character development or missing there. Dusty likes being all Dusty? Disc and dice like to do things together? What? Did the authors write a writing course on how to develop characters with the depth of Jar Jar Binks? As for history. I like a bit of Sci-Fi. But the whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been put to death in the Joe universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo Zombies Anyone? But I give the creators the credit for trying to make fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS, but I liked fighting scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it. I do not admit to being able to appreciate VvV as I should. Again, everything gets Joe compared to the ways that were done in the 80s, and honestly nothing will ever compare to GI Joe's honorable days. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it.
