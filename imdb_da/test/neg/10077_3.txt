(One possible minor spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but stupid movie that did the job and was actually pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had a few decent moments, but they were destroyed by the lame end of the movie, which had a T-Rex running amok in San Diego. Now in "Jurassic Park III", which little story was in the first and the sequel, has been thrown out of the window and replaced by only 90 minutes of basic non-stop action that would have worked if the movie hadn't been so badly done . <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, who gets a suggestion from a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to bring them to an island to help them find their son who has been lost for over 2 months. But of course the island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs, and of course the plane they are on just collides and leaves them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them. This one, of course, was calculated as a thrill ride, without any real story, but even at that level the film does not deliver. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to take the little magic back into the "Jurassic" movies and squeeze life straight out of it. Dinos looks okay even though they are just standard fair and not very scary. The bottom line is that it is not a very good movie, even as an exciting tour. * out of 4 stars.
