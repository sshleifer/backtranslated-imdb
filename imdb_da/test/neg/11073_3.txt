If it is true that the film only costs 150K to make, it explains a lot. But it does not explain why it has no real plot. In the middle of the film I didn't care if they did it or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The finish was really stupid and made me want me to just close the movie and go to bed early. Pretty good acting trades considering there wasn't much to go with. If you enjoy really bad movies with terrible lighting (even for a cave) and bad camera work (even for a cave) ... then you really like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old, how could he have forgotten how to speak and build so much anger? Wouldn't he have wanted help from the first people he'd seen, even though it was 14 years later?
