"Black Dragons" is another feature that WWII propaganda film is popular at that time. It's not as bad as some want you to believe. A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious alien name Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly afterwards, the participants at the meeting begin to be murdered, where their bodies are placed at the steps of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Colombia Suspects Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is awarded the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who is trying to help him. The reasons for Colome's actions are not explained before the final coil. Until everything is explained at the end, history is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, which at this time had been reduced to appear in a number of low budget budgets, is actually quite good in this. He is not allowed to act as much as he did uslly, and credit for this must go to Director William Nigh. Lugosi's character strikes through the shadows and reminds of his Dracula even to the point of complete close-ups of his piercing eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, a one-dimensional actor at best, will be TV's Lone Ranger for a few years. Joan Barclay does a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although slightly dated now, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
