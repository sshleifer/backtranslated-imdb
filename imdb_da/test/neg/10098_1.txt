2001 was perhaps not Eric Robert's best year. Both Raptor and this came out. Looked at Raptor some time ago and really thought it sucked and was Eric's worst. But that was what was fun and D-standard. This one has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the probably worst actor these days. The story lacks any kind, and all things feel even slower than a snail that breaks in curves. The two things that stand out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You can argue that their efforts are good or what, but in relation to the rest, they are above all criticism. Thank you, Roberts sees you next time (and hopefully a better one).
