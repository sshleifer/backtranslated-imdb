The best thing about the movie is the name, as it describes both the plot and the play. At least they can't say they didn't warn you ... Kind of like the button labeled, "Don't push this". Segal must be empty of things that move like planes, trains, and ships, but the reason remains the same. Under cover guy who is struggling slowly but still beats like 40 mercenaries and doesn't even blink when done. What amazes me is that Segal is as big as a shed, and the evil guys still can't beat him at once with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammunition. Where are all these balls actually going? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples pound Yes Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins doesn't sound so punk) in the floor. I could spend days watching the woman kick her foot over her shoulder so ... especially wearing an outfit like that! It was just a bonus to see Jeffy Get's * ss kicked and fun hoping one of the kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's just time we get stupid wannabe. Tough guy can't trade rappers out of the movies. Pleeeeease! Who came up with idea anyway? I would put the odds, it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels. The only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't make it politically correct and have Jeffy come in and save the day. Without a doubt Snoop (who is otherwise known by his mum as Calvin Broadus, who again doesn't sound so cold when you refer to him as Cal), had been in the movie, he would throw some signs of her and probably save Segal's life or something.
