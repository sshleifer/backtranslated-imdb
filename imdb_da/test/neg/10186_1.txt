I warn you people out there, it's just a waste of your time. I'm honest when I say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just a feature of Christian propaganda! Don't throw your life, don't see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the movie so more people would believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. The actors are all beginners, the story is just unclear! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a devil's work. <br /> <br /> This movie is just not worth watching, so please take my advice and not!
