When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You are in for dark, shaking movies like "Alice" and "Little Otik" or short gems like "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky." All of these are excellent films that represent disruptive, surrealistic filmmaking at best. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, you are advised to leave room in a hurry. Swine maid's films in this vein tend to be both youth and preaching, and repeatedly present straw-man caricatures to express their pseudo-radiant insights. <br /> <br /> "Lunacy" is unfortunately very much the latter type of film. Cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper thin for a horrible two hours. There are a few moments that are briefly of interest, but these few oases are separated by large deserts of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you found Svankmajer's horrible, monotonous short film "A Cetera" brilliant and fun, you will probably love "lunacy". If you have never seen a Swan Maiden movie before, start somewhere else.
