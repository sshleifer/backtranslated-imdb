This movie is called "Solomon Kane". Which is not. The protagonist has a hat, but that's all he has in common with Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane, known from early mass magazines and many publications ever since. It's a fantasy movie, not really that bad, and it can easily have passed with a pretty good review - if it hadn't been called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character, which is definitely not SK. The story is not Robert Howard, either. As a fantasy film, it is a more film that follows the traditions of the genre: simple history, bad CGI, bad actors, poor conducting. But it can be fun, you know, 'The cheaper they are, the better they'. But since it's called Solomon Kane, I can't accept it. Imagine a Lord-of-the-Rings movie with a whole Bilbo fighting the Black Magician Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with a final battle where the three use a magic ring to kill the evil wizard who has turned into the dragon Gondorian. Imagine it. This is exactly what this movie has done with Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 4 star rating if it was just another horror movie, but since it is called Solomon Kane, I can only rate it 3 stars.
