Was unfortunate enough to see this while traveling by bus across Africa. It was by far the worst movie I've ever encountered. Deserves to be # 1 all-time worst ;-) No action, no plot, very little speaking. Lots of monkey-like grunting even in this hopelessly unlikely movie. An ignorant self-satire - you will either laugh at it or cry.
