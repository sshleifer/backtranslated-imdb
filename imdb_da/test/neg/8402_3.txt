I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact that they both rely on protagonists suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, it's like comparing the silence of the lamb and Friday the 13th when both involved a sign killing more people. They could no longer be separated into ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo deals with a copier man at a company with short-term memory loss. He consistently follows another gentleman and his boss likes having sex with him in the office. You get a temp that also gets involved with him and must / must not use him for sex. Needless to say, he has a lot of on-screen sex. <br /> <br /> Wait, there's more. There is a boy running into the troubled amnesia man and it is obvious that there is more to this boy just bumping into him. And there is a notebook that the man holds to try to remember important tracks. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm not a foreign movie. I don't mind reading the subtitles, but I am aware that sometimes it goes away from one of my favorite aspects of a movie: good dialogue. Since they have to translate, or I don't want to understand most of the time, I really think they simplify what the characters have to say. This movie was no exception; the dialogue was just, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As for history, it was interesting enough to stay around for 98 minutes. Nice, yes, but then again I do not live in France, so I'm not so familiar with their likes / dislikes or lifestyle. (For example, I think it is acceptable for a father to lie with and frolic in the wave with his son on the beach. It must be a cultural thing.) Fortunately, it was not two + hours of time invested in seeing this man regain his past and gradually move forward to his cure. Because when the "secret" is learned, I was like, really? Well, okay then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend for some decent acting, great people and soft porn sexual situations (like every 2-4 minutes), but if you're not in that kind of scene, I would wholeheartedly skip this slowly moving and memory-recovering film.
