Why is it that virtual "x-rated video game" women can talk through their mouths, but virtual fighting champion Dante needs a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I feel they either needed to throw someone who looked more villainous (Michael Bermardo's big brown eyes did not exactly attack fear in the hearts of the well .. all except perhaps casting directors who consistently threw him as either a villain or a heroic 'bad boy'.) OR they should just let him use his real voice (and move his mouth) and maybe give him a costume that wouldn't make him stick out like a sore thumb as he descended the street. (But of course this is the future, and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm.)
