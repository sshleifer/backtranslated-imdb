This was a letdown in many ways. The location in Ireland, although quite beautiful at times, cannot save this uninspired flick. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as the couple are trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion, are just not interesting signs. Paul at the end of the movie becomes incredibly annoying, and you want her to just shut her mouth up, as she seems to be screaming as if it has just become an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as. The opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a cut off hand climbing over her swirling, naked body. Although the woman is quite appropriate, it does nothing historical. You leave behind thinking about the production team needed to throw out a short term and just throw in some upholstery and a little T and A. The CGI effects are also cartoon-like, and the burning final rivals co-manager Roger Corman are much earlier and far superior movie The fall of the House of Usher in all its ineffective fairness. Any attempt at real excitement and excitement, and consequently chills, is thrown out of the window in this low budget bust. If you like pictures of Ireland, you can find something here, but you'd better rent or buy a travel proposal. Skip this unless you are discriminatory and think the plot is secondary. Rent another low budget ghost story (if you can find it) titled The Woman In Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. This was a wasted opportunity.
