I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good at all. There was no sympathetic sign in the picture and the plot was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Wife. Masterson is a great actress, but she just hasn't drawn the "hard girl" character. (She had similar problems with her character on the second day of Christmas.) Maybe she should avoid these signs, especially those with an unpleasant female child to get rid of. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood was unimpressive. Her character was abrupt, clean and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> To get full disclosure, I couldn't even finish seeing this picture. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.
