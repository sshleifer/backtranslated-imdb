my friend made me see this horrible movie .. ugh .. it was so stupid ... <br /> <br /> it's about a black black guy who gets an airline and makes it a stupid pimp thing <br /> <br /> With snooping dogs working as a pilot for God knows why. This movie is rubbish white people and has many racist stereotypical events that make it fun. <br /> <br /> The white people of Asain and trying to make the movie seem like all black people are cool pimps and all white people are losing ... and black people get all the girls blah blah blah etc ... I despise my friend to make me watch this movie .. I kept saying "GOD Turn it OFF !!" and he is like "NOT UNDERSTANDING FUNNY IS ABOUT HAPPY" we finally end up turning it off halfway through. Thank goodness ... I recommend this movie to people with very very poor taste in humor ..
