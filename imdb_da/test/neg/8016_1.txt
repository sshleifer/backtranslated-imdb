This movie is an almost complete waste of time. I study the book to my English level, and the film only contributes in a way, and it comes across the whole scenario set in a rural idyll. The action is wood, the filmography is ridiculous, and the so-called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class (including me) cunning in their texts. The book, although not my favorite literary choice, is miles better than the movie is, and the soundtrack is just rather annoying. Don't watch the movie unless you are looking for a timeless quality story transformed into thoughtless, media waste.
