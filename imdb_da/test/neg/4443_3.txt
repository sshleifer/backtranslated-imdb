Seeing QUINTET is not unlike looking at a group of people playing a pun in Portuguese or another language you don't understand. You get the idea that they are playing a game and if you look closely enough you can just start to understand the rules. But why bother, as it is clear, you can't join and you wouldn't have if you had the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not one to ask an audience to suffer his films, let alone understand them. Sometimes he lets you get into the picture to be part of the audience, as in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, movies so full of hub and orchestrated chaos, one or two bodies in the scene would not Makes much of a difference. And other times, he seems to insult the fact that someone might even see his movie; as in pictures or three women, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman intentionally awakens someone to get involved in the story. <br /> <br /> You can't rely on Altman to make the logic or the expected, which is sometimes what makes his movie so remarkably iconoclastic. But sometimes the unexpected does not dare, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET, we are introduced to a young woman who apparently is the last person on earth who is able to conceive and is actually with child. This last ray of hope in a decaying society is almost immediately extinguished; Altman does not even wait for the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic story. He lets us know how empty and pointless life is just outside bats. Brave? Maybe. Stupid? Definitely. Without a purpose, he tries to build a story on a fast-melting iceberg that constantly reminds us of how effortless the effort is. <br /> <br /> At least, the QUINTET record can be said to be prophetic. The story is centered on a treacherous game played by the various boring characters. It is a form of TAG (murder game): A handful of people target each other for elimination, each as a wild assassin and each as a wild victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill one third. When they die, new targets are assigned. The one who lives wins. All this happens at some exotic, inhospitable wilderness. It is largely an extreme sci-fi version of "Survivor" - minus the commercial plugs and faked "reality". It's not a bad concept for a sci-fi epic. A post-apocalyptic setting, a microcosm in the world (the throw is point multinational), a game where no one can trust or at least not for long, and where no one really wins. Literally a cold war. A steely eyed instructor with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day. The mystery of QUINTET is not in the game or how it is played, but in why it all exists. If the game "Quintet" is a metaphor for life, Altman seems to see nothing in the material, but a chance to show life to be an empty, meaningless game - a conclusion as obvious as being untrue. Because of the lively, though cynical, nature of the rest of his diverse films, I don't think Altman also believes in QUINTET. And if Altman doesn't have faith in his material, why should we?
