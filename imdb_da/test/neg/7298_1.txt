This film is far and wide and undoubtedly the only worst and most despicable film in the history of the universe. It's really so bad. <br /> <Personally, I've always had the guilty joy of a horrible movie, and rented it, who thought it would be one of them. To my enormous disappointment it was not. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in a way that sounds like reading the lines directly from posters, history makes absolutely no sense, and the actual movie looks like it was shot on a home camera. I couldn't even finish seeing it. It is even worse than the "Witch Academy" and it is a good effort in itself. I can't even begin to understand how an instructor could shoot this movie, and still it has the meaning to believe it was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> Painful, horrible, horrible.
