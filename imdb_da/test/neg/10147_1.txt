Now I've seen it all. Just as I thought it couldn't be more pathetic and cheeses than "Woodchipper Massacre" just as I thought dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than "Nail Gun Massacre" just as I thought "Don't go into Woods "Will keep its title as the Lousiest Slasher Film Ever, along comes" THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY! "Somehow this cheap, miserable manure manages to avoid bias, but it remains awful! I couldn't believe in my eyes - for once I can't complain about excessive (or in this case any) nudity in a slasher film, but I still managed to shamelessly embarrass myself to rent it. Never before have I seen such horrible plays, dialects, direction, writing, .... I could continue forever with this list! Here's a fast decline: <br /> <br /> A mental patient somehow avoids the luney bin, dressing up as a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctor's daughter has friends over for the night. Then the most stupid killing spree (ripped from other movies like "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween ") begins this side of the universe, the characters have negative IQs, suggesting they are not human, so again I think they are not because they tend to soften Kool-Aid when they are cut, as the slasher likes to show use when he holds his dandruff to the camera in the WAY for many scenes. must we look at that bowl before it consumes the whole movie? .. which i suppose would not be so bad for an idea in this case! There is a moment where i might have thought maybe maybe, the director would make it interesting ( another murderer was added) but unfortunately it was not to be! And so insulting even more, there is a stupid super-out-ending and an even stupid final conclusion, it probably doesn't make a lot of sense, but i would hate to give away the stupid few scenes in movie history to the t o or th re fools (like me) stupid enough to rent this sewage. <br /> <br /> I hope that by writing this I have saved 80 minutes of the lives of others. I come to my hands and knees to ask someone who is still thinking of renting this: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE NOT! This is a fan of slasher genre speeches; I know what's good for you! The only real victims in this rattlebrained, asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank! Zanato's score ... since there is no negative point scale, I must give it a 1, but a sub average 1 there. Avoid it at all costs .... thanks !!!!
