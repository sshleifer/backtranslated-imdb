I rented this mindset, it would be pretty good at the cover of the film's case. Judge and jury began to be really good killer, chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie was gradually stupid as it continued. David Keith is a great actor, especially when he plays a role like this so badly that the movie was a piece of shit, it really wasted his talent. Judge and jury were quite stupid I gave it a 3 should have given it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.
