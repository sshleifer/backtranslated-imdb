ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's greats. This film about a fired politician who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not so much a comedy. There are some moments that I enjoyed, like looking at Candy in a pilot suit, but it doesn't seem to matter much. ARMED AND DANGEROUS is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the just stupid actions COMMANDO. What a sad excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 5
