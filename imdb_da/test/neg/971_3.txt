MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AWAY !!! <br /> <br /> How did such talented actors get involved in such a mindless directing <br /> <br /> drive? Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard <br /> <br /> fierce, tough politician (ie he beats the bad guys and rolls his eyes on the police who prefer to stick to the book) and Eddie Murphy plays a <br /> <br /> not as hard police officer would be an actor (ie, he screams out, <br /> <br /> "Freeze, Police!" and have his "hard look" down pat) . Of course, they are <br /> <br /> collaborators when Bobby's loose canon tactic gets him in hot water with the media, and he's essentially extorted to starring in a <br /> <br /> "Cops" -like reality show. Take a breath, cuz it's just as fun as it gets <br /> <br /> No energy was put in the script - it feels like a pale retread of <br /> <br /> every copy buddy movie thrown in a blender with "15 minutes" with the lead role, <br /> <br /> yes, DeNiro himself as, pretty much the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> The wit falls flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to be <br /> <br /> good time. It's dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Even if you have an overwhelming affinity <br /> <br /> for one of the players - avoid it and benefit them. Becauze if this <br /> <br /> earns money, these kinds of scripts will be considered perfectly acceptable <br /> <br /> for their quality actors. <br /> <br /> And to Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious movies. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You were nominated for prizes for them - remember how <br /> <br /> it was fun it was? Now after "Analyze this" (which was good), "Meet the <br /> <br /> Parents" (which was also good) and "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" (which was not good), I think we need to see you parodying yourself less and be yourself more. "Casino" feels like a long time ago <br /> <br />. And no, I don't count "15 minutes" as serious Bobby. Anyone who <br /> <br /> took the media satir seriously must get their weekly world news
