I suggest that any movie made by the Sci channel and subsequently released on DVD in the future must say that it was actually made of such a channel that I would not buy these things if I had known this fact. Not that it was all bad, but when you have promoted advertising in the middle of your movie, it just destroys the flow of the movies. This, in turn, makes the movie rather boring. One had an interesting story, but the heartbreaking and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the movie, like most of the bad actors except Dien and Linda Carter. The story, vampires are on the attack in South America, of course, the rules of vampire films are not in force, as they are normally not in any of the films about vampires I have seen lately except the Blade trilogy. Group of soldiers sent down to fight the team, another team sent to meet with the team and track a wife from one of the soldiers ... why she not only is his wife who knows who this part of the plot really does not where. Still we get an interesting boat trip some beautiful jungle landscapes and a lot of blood. However, this fact does not save the movie from being shaken in its presentation and really boring, apparently at times. I may not know it was the blood, and smoke and what to do now, even though old effects look better and do not cost much more. I think cheap Italian zombie film could make a bullet hole without cgi why can't we now?
