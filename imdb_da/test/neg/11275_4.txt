With some movies it is really hard to tell who they were made. Huevos de concern seems to be aimed at the well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be many jokes in this movie that you do not understand if you are an outsider. This can be pretty annoying. Symbols and references to art and popular culture are superfluous. The film refers to Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel's and Surrealist's work in general, some confusion with bidet baths seems to point to Duchamp's finished food. In addition, the main character also has an advantage for karaoke bands with songs by Julio Iglesias. But why all this is mixed together on a pretty beautiful but also free way simply removes me. I can only guess that it all serves to highlight the protagonist's vital, impetuous, vulgarity, which the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. How all the really beautiful women run after him (the main character I think) is a little disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie has three parts. It starts in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the protagonist, does his military service, apparently in engineering corps. Then it goes on to the resort of Benidorm in Spanin, where Benito just wants to build the tallest skyscraper on the spot and become a vulgarized Howard Roark. In the last part, a defeated Benito goes to Miami, Florida, probably to start a new life. "But the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily. It is also somehow annoying that there is no character development and that the movie comes down in a soap opera mode without being convincingly ironic. It must be said, that Javier Bardem is very fond of playing the young stud that grows and blows. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because I'm interested in Cityscapes, and Benidorm is a kind of special place, townscape. This aspect met Huevos' concerns only partially, in Jess Franco's She Killed In Ecstasy (1970) this particular location was used in a more rewarding way.
