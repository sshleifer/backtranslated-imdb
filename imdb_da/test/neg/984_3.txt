I always think it would be nice if you could somehow get a "snap preview" of some of the old movies being re-released on DVD before you buy them. That way, you can save yourself time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so completely let down. <br /> <br /> "Buddy Holly Story" is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot or brass around with historical facts that this movie includes, because I had already agreed with them twenty years ago when I first began to see it. <br /> <br /> I had recorded it on the old (Monaural) Beta machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regular game favorite. The very best was Gary Busey's performance as the young Buddy and his almost perfect vocals and guitar plays. I was looking forward to the day when I could get it in ... STEREO ... and this is where the disappointment comes. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is (probably) re-mastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but I'm afraid it sadly left me down and looked at my watch and wished it to end . <br /> <br /> The sound is creepy that borders on the incomprehensible, and so unprofessionally mixed that I longed for the crystal clear vocals of my old Beta tape! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of the pictures, or the plot or characters, the right drawing card here is MUSIC ...... and if you can't hear the main voice because they are drowned out by the cymbals, or backing harmonies or other surroundings, then there is not much left is there? <br /> <br /> I'll convert my old Beta version to the (Mono) DVD for subsequent views, and put it here where it belongs, with the waste! <br /> <br /> "Eradication is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
