The other woman is about a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone will hurt him. A girl who likes him will help him, but she is led to believe that his fear is caused by a mental illness ... Interesting plot, very good play, but the result as a whole is poor in many ways. The story is too simplistic, or rather, presented in a simplistic way (although there are a few interesting plots). For example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. I don't want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean if you see the movie. "Come on, it was the fifties!" Still, I've seen a few movies from that era, and I know some don't seem so dated today. Something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot tone dark, making it almost impossible to see what was going on. Ok, it's a movie noir, but this one is too noir on some points ...: o) <br /> Overall, the other woman is not a masterpiece in the era, but no waste either. See it if you have nothing else to do ...
