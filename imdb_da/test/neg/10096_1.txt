Worst movie ever seen. Worst deal too. I can't imagine a movie worse than this. Nothing to see. No action at all. T he (actors) must search for another job. I don't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie. I'm sorry Eric Roberts. Must be tough ... I can't imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage should be to justify taking the job! <br /> <br /> The ladies in the movie ... maybe they are better at XXX. <br /> <br /> As for the leading man ... what a lead! He gets better at a lead and stays there! I can see him more successfully barking instead of acting. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: DO NOT RENT ... DO NOT BUY!
