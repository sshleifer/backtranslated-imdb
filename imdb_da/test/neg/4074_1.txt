This film was embarrassing in its clich√©s, malfunctioning and generally low production values. It starts out badly with the long-haired 3-star general who calls the hero Masters, "Major" when he of course carries the lieutenant colonel's silver leaf. But what was most disturbing was the soldier's crew of Neptune Atoll. How can you get in touch with any kind of reality? They were all experts on flying a 747 and the scenes from the soldiers digging the trench were beyond comic. WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! Look at your own peril!
