Oh yes it is another story about the classic "sociopathic murderous doctor creating female Frankenstein and falling in love". From the same director who brought you such timeless classics as "10,000 maniacs" (no, not the group) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" film screams almost to the MST3K treatment. The doctor's assistant even has overtones by Torgo from the classic "Manos: The Hands of Fate". I don't know if the graphics, whose fake-looking violence or the frequent stretches of dialogue-free tedium could have scared the crew, though. <br /> <br /> The main reasons for this movie are the hysterical 'hypnosis' scene, the ridiculously serious endings and the rock bottom production values. In fact, I have seen all the credits for this movie for the same reason that you tend to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident. It and the pure genius in the ending that sounds like a water "My Favorite Things" played on a toy piano. Goblin this is not it.
