Susan inadvertently strikes a drug trafficking while her real estate agent gets a flat tire while she is driving her to see a house. The leader of that drug ring, Mongo (who only has one week to retire) thinks she knows much more than that this ridiculous blonde actually seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything, and so begins one of those several bone films that I have put through. <br /> <br /> All the actors in this movie can't really work at least. Susan makes a great ineffective hero for most of the movie (she would never escape several times, if not for the fact that everybody in the movie seems to have sex with her) and she doesn't take the offensive for the last 20 minutes of the girl. When she does, she spits some generic "I've got enough" line, preaches on sister, that much thought ran through my mind several times when I saw this <br /> <br /> My character: D-
