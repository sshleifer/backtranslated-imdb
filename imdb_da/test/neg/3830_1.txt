I was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released. I had to watch the movie and later fill out a package on my mind. It was the hardest thing to sit on the ground. The view just crawls and you quickly begin to die. The thing is, there are two types of Mormon films. The good ones with really good stories, and the crazy ones just stink. Saints and soldiers, now there is a good movie. But with these wannabe comedies, the authors and actors are just trying too hard. Basically, they try to be fun when they are not. No wonder why there is such a small audience for these movies; They are filled with 'inside jokes' that are not fun at first, and they just try to poker fun on the average stuff. It's the story that makes the movie, and the stories of these movies are just weak. I bet you can guess what my package looked like when I was told to fill it after the movie. ;)
