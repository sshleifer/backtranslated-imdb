I can't stress how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little unintelligible shot to make these people look so "needy". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you get the new clark to play a crackhead? You should be banned from movie pictures for the rest of your life Buddy Giovinazzo. <br /> <br /> I take serious offense against this fool who wants to cast real actors like bullies and lowlifes as a kind of smart joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why do they shout so much? Why are all so bad? Why are the children so dirty? Nobody wants to be so dirty? Not even a crackhead child. <br /> <br /> You have to grow up and don't make any movies ever again.
