This is a big disappointment. The main problem is the action. Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty bad as Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is very stylish and unnatural. Also the camera's work is very 1980s, which is cramped and jumped, compared to eg. 1995's P&P. <br /> <br /> The script is, if there is anything too faithful in the book, and there are some worthy expressions that should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In every way, this is far more subordinate to the latest movie version, which, although it took great liberties with the book, seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was much more enjoyable.
