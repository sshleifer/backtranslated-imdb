I can hardly find the words to describe how much this piece of waste insulted me. Why is it that American filmmakers always go out of the way to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of backward asshole babies and worse yet, throw people to play Jamaica, who sounds ridiculous when trying to imitate the accent? We are not all extremely dark, we are not all going to carry machetes, whether they are for work or PROTECTION, we do not go around naked in our home and we do not exercise VOODOO !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I am sick and tired of seeing all these portraits of Jamaicans as a bunch of dreadlock wearing Rastafarians who do nothing but sit all day smoking on a beach or shooting weapons in the air (When we don't live in our wooden houses). Yeah, we wear clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weeds are not legal on the island and chances are we speak better English than you! The worst thing is, it's not just me who is sour and bitter, it's real answers to questions that most Jamaicans who have traveled abroad have been asked at some point. Read a book before assuming how it is in another country and worse yet, decide to make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The country where everything we do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums ... Tales from the Crypt has officially sucked me along with the entire crew of people working on this waste, especially the author.
