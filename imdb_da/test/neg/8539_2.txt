Just like this movie on the opening night. I read some other user comments that convinced me to see it ... I have to say I was not impressed. I'm so impressed that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of you people some money. First of all, "The Messengers" is very predictable and just not much of a thriller. It can be scary for anyone under 13, but it really didn't matter to me. The climax was ridiculous and most of the audience went back before the film's decision. <br /> <br /> In addition, the play seemed a little shallow. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than undervoltage scenes. <br /> <br /> If you've seen examples of this movie, you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.
