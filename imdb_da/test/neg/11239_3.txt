If a movie can't hold your interest for the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as I'm concerned. This concept, which you simply have to deal with a slow first third of a movie and later rewarded, is nonsense. A good movie must start and end strong. It seems interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately confused and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to look at, many of which I'm sure most of you haven't seen that I would really skip this and look elsewhere. Why does IMDb require a minimum of 10 lines for reviews? I said my piece and I hope it helps some of you move on to the next movie.
