Oh man, this movie was foolishly bad. Poor appearance, horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it should be a comedy and everything, but something tells me that this movie should be the right deal. The movie certainly does not start as a comedy, but more like an adventurous movie with fun elements put into it. In particular, you could tell that they were serious about this by acting, it was in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a few over-the-top sequences of course. It seemed to me that initially tried to make a real and serious adventurous science-fiction movie, perhaps even a franchise, but soon began to notice how bad it all was and simply decided to insert some more and deliberately exaggerated comic sequences to make the movie seem more like a comedy and prevent it from becoming a completely disastrous mess. <br /> <br /> The movie is a strange attempt to blend adventurous swashbuckling pirate movies with serious science-fiction action. The film was, of course, inspired by the "Star Wars" films and its success. The movie is not even ashamed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story progresses, sets, signs and robots show similarities. They tried to hide this by putting some obvious spoofing sequences, but I didn't fall for it. So the film is not even original on its own despite its original concept. You can say that this movie is a poor man's "Spaceballs", without even being completely wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie looks bad, with some special video game effects (in some sequences even literally) horrible fancy costumes (post and sword in outer space?). The sound is sometimes even ridiculous. Seems like they shot some sequences without sound and then forgot to add all the required sounds later in the after-production. the mixture is also very poor. They tried to hide this by setting the sound to a minimum at times and by setting Bruce Broughton's musical score. <br /> <br /> At times, the movie is so busy making the movie look humorous, completely forgetting to tell the story. It makes the story of the movie seem extremely messy and poorly written, with an almost completely undeveloped main plot. It also does not help to make the film really fluid. Lots of things are not explained and some are even lost after a while. The movie begins as a pirate movie that constantly looks and steals water, as it is scarce, and there is only one planet in the whole galaxy that remains with water on it (yes!). But this plot line will soon be abandoned, especially in the middle of the movie, where the movie seems to be quite different with different motivations. It's like the one weird and stupid, stupid order after another without really making a click. It also keeps the signs too low and uninteresting to worry about. <br /> <br /> Sad to see actors such as John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and an ever-young and unknown Ron Perlman attached to this disastrous movie. /> <br /> OK, I admit that I liked some moments, especially the end when going through the time war was original and fun, but really, not all of this was enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even like the movie in a campy sort of way. <br /> <br /> 2/10
