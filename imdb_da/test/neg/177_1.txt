The movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are too many unfocused and very roughly edited scenes. One could easily get a cleaner movie using a decent amateur camera and 100 $ video editing software. Earth on Earth does not mean blunt editing. Unfocused scenes that do not contain important statements should have been deleted. The same applies to ensuring that the object's head / hand / other remains in the frame. My 8 year old son knows it now. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The main point (anti globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why bother with the rest. After the interview with James Suckling, I pushed the "stop" button. What a waist of time. <br /> <br /> The main theme no longer works for me. I have seen many small vineyards producing mediocre commercial wines and many large vineyards that produce large and unique wines. The film identifies the small producers as those who produce wines with more identity or terroir. The larger ones are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film tries to make a black and white phrase in a world full of grayscale. However, the film has not proved this requirement. They look at a few sporadic examples, "binds" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and gave "interviews" with key people. Well, did all the small producers use WWII in the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has anything to do with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and convincing.
