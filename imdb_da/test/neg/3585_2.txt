Egads. <br /> <br /> I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure anymore, Willy gives Keannu a bit of tough competition with his "I'm made of plaster" performance in this movie. Combine it with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a uniform character, and it is quite difficult to recommend this turkey. Natasha is trying her best, but even Julia Roberts could not save this flick from ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else about it. - Hi, in that case just read a book.
