(SMALL SPOILERS) I just bought the DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends, and I couldn't believe what had happened. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 movies, the critics at least had a sense of humor (especially the third movie), but not only did the critics have little appearance, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit that the story started nicely. After an hour had passed, I remembered that the Critters movies were always very short. So I thought of myself, "Where $ ^% # $ are critters?!?!" They were hardly in this movie! If it didn't make me angry, the boy Ethan sat on his bed after Charlie had "murdered the ship" and he knew the critics were still on board! In the first film, the brown family was frightened by their mind. But here Ethan didn't even worry! It was as if the critters were not even a threat! <br /> <br /> Now what to say next can ruin the end, but I will say it anyway. In the first film, at the end, they had to face the giant critter for a last battle. In the other, there was the big ball of critter. In the third film, critter burned with his fave a spindash (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and wanted to attack that little child. But at the end of the fourth (which is what made me the worst) accuse the bald critic of Ethan, and Ethan kills it as if it were nothing. <br /> <br /> Now, something that I really don't understand is what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. So after 50 years he is evil. It was very disappointing. Not only that but was he not a faceless bounty hunter? Why was he still "Johnny Steele?" Plus he seemed to have another personality. He seemed much smarter and not as monotonous as the first two. Does anyone actually enjoy the first two critters movies and loved the third, I give Critters 4 a 2/10
