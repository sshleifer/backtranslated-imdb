I was in 6th grade and this film was broadcast on PBS under a series called 'Wonderworks'. I remember clearly sitting on a sofa and watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. In the movie Jesse, the protagonist is an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Because of a very simple but careless error, one of the couple dies. At that time, I found the story very powerful because the fatal error is exactly the type of error a child would make and so a child watching the movie will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of that tragedy. that follows. <br /> <br /> Last year I finally asked a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have fixed my memories. Seeing the show as an adult I was totally shocked at what a terribly made movie was this. My boyfriend also had a similar memory of the movie, and she was also pretty sad about how little the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. I strongly recommend that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this movie as an adult.
