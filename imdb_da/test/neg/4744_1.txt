Turd Pie: <br /> * Take x2 franchises * Couple cook for 5 minutes * Stir in mixed cardboard characters (not actors work best) * Add 2 tons of clich√©s then bake in your plot-Hole Microwave until bored. * Server with a spray of Dawson's Crack (not a typography) <br /> <br /> Voila! - Money spinning Brain Rot for Emo / World of Warcraft Generation <br /> <br /> Looking for the keys in the drain was the best bit (?) <br /> <br /> Apart from the first 5 minutes, its a of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Otter, Otter, Nonsense.
