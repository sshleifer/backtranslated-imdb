This movie was really fun, even though it wasn't supposed to be! The action was stupid and so were the voices. Almost all it was was a guy walking around a maze of maize for an hour and a half. They threw in this stupid super natural thing that made it even dumber. It wasn't even like a normal movie, this weird crazy music played almost all the way through the movie. What about maze maze horror movies? The dark children were really scary, I thought, and I thought it would be something like that, but it was really just stupid. The main character just went around aimlessly shouting for these two little girls. And then at the end he likes to kill someone or something. It is worth seeing if you are with your friends because it is really fun, how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie, don't waste your time
