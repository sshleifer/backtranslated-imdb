When I first saw the researchers on this movie on TV, I thought it could be a funny movie. I was mistaken. All though I am not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually fun as the first scary movie. This was one of many that has been made as late as it is. The mood of this movie was anything but fun and was pretty boring. I feel the biggest problem is that they poked fun on too many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc. And if you are something like me, try to choose each movie instead of paying attention to what going on in this. Even the adult humor in this movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save money and time and rent do not rent this movie
