I'm glad I never saw this show when it came out. <br /> <br /> I just wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80s with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How have I ever survived growing up in this era? <br /> <br /> The action of most episodes I've seen is forced. This gives very boring shows. The baselines are not very interesting as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> Stick with the old Twilight Zone showing and saving yourself the pain of seeing garbage.
