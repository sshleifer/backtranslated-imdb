Whoa! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention it terribly? You can tell at the DVD deck not to get the movie, but unfortunately that was not the case for me. Well, somebody brought this home to me to see, and when I looked at it, I would just choke the person because they used my money. I will definitely take it back soon, but I might as well tell you while I have it in memory, for I will surely have to forget it. This movie does not deserve to be called horrible. It is beyond terrible. Maybe the worst movie ever. The action was so so so terribly disgusting, as well as the deaths were so utterly paralyzed and predictable. I didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, what kind of scares me a little. Don't watch this movie, shame on you once you look at this movie site and I have EXTREME pity for you if you look at this movie page because you think it will be DECENT.Final words: YUCK !!!!!! !!!!
