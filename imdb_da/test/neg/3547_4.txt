Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene Cleaner upper. In his latest job, he cleanses a new crime and destroys evidence and is not aware that crime has not been officially reported. Uh, it can't be good. <br /> <br /> You are constantly talking about cleaning agents, but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when body etc. is to be removed and the area cleaned. This one is different because Tom Cutler is working with the police to clean up after the police have made their investigation into a crime scene. Hey, somebody has to do it. You know the police won't. The film makes it quite clear and it is up to the family to have the area cleared up. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but a side plot with Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story somewhat awkward. I suppose they should fill a time. Oh, they brought this side plot around to connect with the other side plot, but it was still a reach and awkward. See? <br /> <br /> It was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of excitement, excitement and pace was something dull. The music also didn't help when I noticed the music was more appropriate to watch people take a long journey. You know, travel music. Get it? HA! <br /> <br /> The action of all was excellent in this almost a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Emergency: No, Language: No
