This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted to have those hours in my life back. For God's sake, go far away from this horrible crumb ball movie at all costs. It is not worth mentioning the title, but the reviews on this movie are quite generous for a vomiting scum movie like this one. And where do I start? The stupid A ** children in the movie ..... Zero plot or story? ... Garden-sort college / frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the very bad act, teen anxiety insinuation? $$$ # @% @! My God, it never ended! ..... I remember thinking that I would rather kiss the cinema floor and then sit through it again. But what do you expect? Most people with brain power to look up reviews will not be the target audience at all - so you can see Pirites 2 again, or Jet Lee - if you are discussing for yourself. Look, this movie will just cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. WARNING.
