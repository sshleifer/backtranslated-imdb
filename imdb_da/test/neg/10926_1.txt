One of the commentators on the subject Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove) got it right when he / she said the movie is really bad, but I take exception when he / she commented on the animation. <br /> The animation wasn't bad because of Macromedia Flash. It was bad animation because it was corrected incorrectly. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any Disney movie, and in the wrong hands it may look as bad as things on the Internet, where Lil Pimp originates and should have stayed there. <br /> <br /> Studios such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create wonderful animation using Flash (ie, Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Mucha Lucha, etc.). <br /> <br /> Lil 'Pimp was an incredibly pronounced piece of tripe that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the features included. Roth and the company thought they would make a quick buck that exploits a turd like Lil 'Pimp, and sham was sustained by producer Amy Pell. The reason for this third trimester loss of an animated film is that none of the leaders at Revolution Studios had the pragmatic brains for the sideline Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they tried their best, but were far above their heads) and hired real authors. directors and at least one semi-competent producer. They did one thing correctly, but they hired some of the best storyboarders, designers and animators in LA, but as Lil 'Pimp demonstrates, one can buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you are a moron then you will ruin it altogether safe.
