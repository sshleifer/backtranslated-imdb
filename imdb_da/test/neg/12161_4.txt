I went to watch this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We both tried to watch our watches well before the movie ended to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long. It's split just about between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable) and plot development. <br /> <br /> One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a smaller tribal chief who overcomes half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. There is a fair bit of raw material from there, from which a pretty good story can be made. But the authors fluffed it completely. We get no real story. Instead, we get a Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What does young Temudjin maintain through his long - almost endless, actually, or so, do they see the viewer - tribulations? Why love a good woman of course. How does he get out of prison? Well, an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and grandeur, sets himself on the continent to go to this good woman a talisman who symbolizes the love of Temudin for her as she died close to her so she could find him when he lies there Talisman in his hand. And of course she goes and becomes (inexplicably) rich and powerful, saves him. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of the hangers? Now he goes to the great wolf god Tengri (or such a name) and Tengri sets him free from magic. Yes right. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to rule the Mongols? Wolf god again, apparently. Off goes Temudjin to ask for guidance, and - surprise! surprise! - He'll get it. "The law," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need is laws. Good, simple." Golly, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And then finally, how does he win the decisive blow to his rival's stronger forces? Better tactics, surely, but also with the help of the good old wolf god, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All troops are strengthening like the thunder rolls and lightning flashes (Mongols are afraid of the thunder you see) - but not our Temjin. The troops, completely wowed by his bravery, praised him king! <br /> <br /> I don't know what induces people to continue producing this kind of garbage. The funny thing is that it is mixed with all kinds of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right, so viewers wouldn't see how infantile some of the big things are. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of graphical violence: slashing impulses, blood nozzles, blood sprays, bloodshots - blood clots actually had a good time. Despite realism, it is impossible to take seriously. <br /> <br /> I must mention the ridiculous CGI last battle scene. How anyone can think these things look realistic beyond me. They don't. Oh, and it's all shot in standard Hollywood style - breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and super-close-up Stedicam stuff for combat scenes. And the standard Dolby super-sound effects of pumps and dips and the constant low-frequency hum to keep tensions. <br /> <br /> Buried. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
