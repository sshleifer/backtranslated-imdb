Attacks on Precinct 13 is the absolutely stupid movie I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame is that they had a good throw and a good prerequisite to work with. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they have said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo, but have the authors of this movie actually seen Rio Bravo? In addition to the fact that Rio Bravo is a western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to hold a prisoner accused of murder to be freed by his brother and his gang. No one will free anyone in area 13 attack. They want everyone dead. So, my first question should be why not just burn the whole place from the start? Why "attack" the place at all? I know that the constructed plot turn was probably smart and shocking, but it didn't make sense and / or was properly presented. If the veteran police were on it from the beginning, why the need for this whole movie? If the veteran law suddenly cut a deal on the back door during the siege, how did he even get the chance? As soon as he got to the door, he would have been shot and they would have had their entry point. It's just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> What part of a city can a whole war take place in a police area (complete with helicopters and massive explosions), but no one knows ?? But as soon as there is fire, they must "leave before the fire department appears" ?????? How did they plan to cover the chaos that happened outside ?? Police radiate balls in the walls, ball bearings, footprints, equipment consumption and the fact that there will be no bodies of "bishops" that exist? What about the police masks? How could they possibly miss so much so often? I like that when the two detainees tried to run, the snipers were crumbled by two small snow heights. As if it is not possible to shoot a high-powered rifle through a pile of snow. <br /> <br /> The setup was interesting, though ridiculous, but the movie just went out of a rock when they decided to kill that character with a ball to the head for absolutely no reason at all. I know the filmmakers were shocked, but all they got was disgust at the horror and anger of the audience. Don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from it? That scene must be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that each plot is dumber than dirt). The conclusion remains stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an Austin Powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people he has finally caught. I know more people have mentioned the final scenes that take place in the forests of Detroit City (> snicker <), but why did Ethan's character first hit the forest in the first place? He doesn't even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend is coming away? They just cut to him who slowly chops in the forest, the gun in his hand. Gack. I could go on but didn't want to. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
