More of a Frisbee as a turtle with fangs going up like a warthog. More fights with people in bird suits that resemble people in bird suits. A ping pong ball spaceship. Two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including getting aboard the spaceship. More tiring music. More "Gamera is the friend of children" things. I remember when Godzill and Rodan came out. The movies were very fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people. Now they are just a few stupid costumes with very little behind them. The adults are all ridiculous and moronic. Like in American sitcoms, the kids are bosses (since they really couldn't think of a paper bag). These monster films should be the Japanese means of partitioning these small snots. Above all, however, having seen three of these films (with the same plot over and over again, see the stocktaking), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you haven't seen this, don't bother.
