Badly directed short "movie" (shot on hi-def or betacam it appears). It screams student film / video all the way. The prerequisite is limited in scope, and the short one actually feels much longer than it runs. Some interesting actors and a decent production value, but not enough to lift this movie from the "hole", it has fallen.
