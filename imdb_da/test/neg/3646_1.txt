Now there are a few things about this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the nation of Iraq as if you have never seen the media covered, and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most Americans, where the film has its largest audience. But all the wonderful things in mind let you take a look at a few other facts in the movie. There were 150 cameras handed out to the Iraqi people, most of whom all see the war and oppression of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the improvement of their nations. And compared to Saddam, it is simply a slight scratch on the skin. Also, Netflix, as the main negotiator, announced it before the fun choice we just had by sending a lot of email to its entire list to watch the movie. Many of those who need to be labeled as statements expressed as facts noted by the interviewed Iraqis are wrong. To review the Red Cross records of the Abu Ghraib tortures, Saddam's henchmen were not tortured. It was a fine mix of 80-90% innocent civilians and 10-20% legally detained people. It was never reported that any of the 10-20% was Saddam's Henchmen or outlaws. In addition, the Arab world has never ever mentioned 'democracy' as one of their opponents, more correctly it is US $ 6 billion a year for Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this movie shows the same distortion. I'm afraid the Iraqi people this movie represents have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a puke and that his removal many looks for the best. It is true that some Iraqis actually get paid a good salary. Just as it is true, no Iraqi people have control over their most valued oil and US companies. Nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians have died exclusively because of American artillery. Still, 15% of the country that once had running water and electricity does not. Nor does it mention that from 1993-2003 UN sanctions planned and authored by the US government killed over 200,000 Iraqi civilians. It also does not mention democracy in people deciding the government, not a massive war machine sending the message "Get killed or obeyed". I'm afraid the floor room will have quite a few Iraqis who aren't so happy about the occupation. Just like the vast majority of the world was not for the war. In fact, America, Britain, Spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy, they turned their backs on it when they saw how full their pockets could be. Hurray, Saddam is out of control, but I'm afraid no Iraqis are still in power. Companies are in power, the media is in power. Read, do your own research, and don't let them bind you.
