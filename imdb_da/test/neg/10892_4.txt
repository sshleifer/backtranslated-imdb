As horror movies go, "Rest Stop", could have been better at many levels. Director / author John Shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, he was also not sure what to do with the material, or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different film than he intended, either from the studio or backers. Several finishes are included in the DVD, but unfortunately the selected product for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psycho roaming back road in a distant part of California presents many opportunities at the beginning. After Jesse's disappearance in the creepy rest, things stop. The bad Nicole stands alone to acquire all the strange things she finds along the way. It was clear when one began to hear "Amazing Grace" in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the road where Nicole a Jess descends their throat in the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not appreciated by the natives . <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk. There are a lot of things going for the aficionados of the genre.
