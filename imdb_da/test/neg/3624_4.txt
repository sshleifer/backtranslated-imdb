This was another of those who showed that I was looking to eradicate the positive elements and because I have been a Nick fan for years. Some of them would be stage sets, B-plots, guest stars, and some of the most important players. I dabbled in the show through high school when I quickly grew to contempt Jamie Spears along with the other chickens in the show who can't act. The only signs I liked were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan. Quinn is a perfect outcast who eventually began to fit in; Stacey is a complete oddball; Dustin gets through a lot of strange, random situations; and Michael is a kind of Logic's comic relief right hand. There is a remarkable difference between the performance and the actors' quality of the B-charts involving them, and the A-plots that exhibited a bunch of screaming girls and an iconic "Miss Perfect" repeating bad lines and possessed of guys. This show would have been good if the main sites contained the quality of side plots, but the main sites just didn't deliver. When it recently came back in reruns and I tried to see it again, I was more aware of the girls' odd action and had to change the channel. However, I will give the aforementioned signs credit because they made the performance more or less worth my time.
