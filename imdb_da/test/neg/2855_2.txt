This movie is simply stupid. Don't see it; Believe me, you feel better. <br /> <br /> Long and short of the plot: A defense lawyer represents a man who murdered his son and other children. To defend him, she comes across a wooden doll by Pinnochio. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio holds and starts killing people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly only to get such a weak end. The reason is very poor, and Dennis Michael Tenney's musical score is pitiful. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is just meaningless and fears no fear or fear. This is far from his work on Demons and Witchboard Night, which is decent excursions, but nothing to write home about. His control is okay, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie fairly. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: 2 out of 10, maybe the most boring movie I've seen all year.
