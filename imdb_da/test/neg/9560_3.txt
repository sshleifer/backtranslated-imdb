A boring gangster movie that leaves you wanting someone to have edited that farce more recklessly. I would have thought that the story of the creation of Las Vegas would prove interesting, but it almost fails every turn. Warren Beatty's performance as the stupid and odd Bugsy Seigel leaves you wanting you to look at someone else. Once or twice, he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene, but most of you just can't care about him. Annette Benning gives a talented ride as her untrustworthy lover, but herself is only weaker more sweet than he is. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really bother with this turgid drama unless you're a Benning devotee.
