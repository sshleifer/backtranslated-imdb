My wife and kids were billed as 00's very own Cosby show - but unlike the latter, it was unfunny and unwatchable. In fact, it is so poorly written, and some of the jokes are about Michael Mickey, who takes Michael Jr's stupidity and the fact that he is such a loser - who became increasingly boring and annoying when the show continued. <br /> What should have been a promising hit, finally turned into a silly, silly show later where the ideas became so OTT and ridiculous. And for the other Claire I ended up suffering this character so much: she became a pampered, childish and moaning teen abruptly in most of the later episodes. <br /> <br /> MWAK was no Cosby show trend set, rather it was just a bad black sitcom of general standards.
