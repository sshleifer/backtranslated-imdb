After watching this movie, I can only wonder about the reasons for creating the movie. This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen and had no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> If it were fun, it could have been a very weak comedy, but as an action thriller it was gloomy. <br /> <br /> Slowly, no plot, no real action, nothing approaches good dialogue and I have no idea the signs. What more can I say. Avoid.
