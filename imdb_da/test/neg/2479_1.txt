Really, really ... What pleases the audience (American one!) In this so-called show is totally beyond me. What we can learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Every casino that spends around $ 2 billion every year to rent a satellite and a huge amount of hi-tech high-definition cameras to their security team. Let the FBI bite the dust off them. <br /> <br /> 2. Each security officer must have successful breasts, of course, natural. The breasts should be displayed all the time, otherwise they will lose their jobs. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee happens to be a man, he must get his breast implanted, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can you blatantly tear off other shows ideas and then implement them as their own and call all this crap "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. Every breast cancer greater than 39D is considered immortal and cannot die. I really want the opportunity to vote with minus values. -10/10 for this one!
