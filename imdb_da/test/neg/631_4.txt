Not a horrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you roll on the floor laughing - not a good thing for an action / thriller. The play is generally quite decent for a sci-fi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military / policeman / sheriff / agent / marshal figure. The special effects are good, "special" - for example, the external train shots are clearly a model train. <br /> <br /> Goofs: A meteor hits a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames, but does not jump an inch. After the effect, the meteor is placed at the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle on which the meteor came. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie's events are predictable from the helicopter crash ("pull up, pull up!") to the fact that the annoying people finally get it to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge waiting for the train, to the sequel's lineup at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenes showing aliens attacking are fun. They are evil cute dolls and move in lightning speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene, four people who shoot clips for clips cannot hit a single creature because they are moving in lightning speed. Later in the movie, Todd Bridges clears up with a mini-flamethrower, which he uses to send a series of creatures up close. Lou Diamond Phillips on several occasions can easily grasp creatures with its bare hands.
