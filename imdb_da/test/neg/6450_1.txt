Tug-3 is just right. Although I'm sure Mr. Osmond wanted to make a sincere, heartfelt Christmas movie, this is as cynical and eerie as they come. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by sweet children, clueless adults and dopey villains. The production values ​​show that this was either filmed on a shoestring or by really inexperienced filmmakers - I suppose the latter unfortunately. The worst part, oddly enough, is really the music. You'd think someone with a long-standing musical career could do better than the title song, but you'd have it wrong. Even my mom didn't like this movie and she likes Osmonds AND sappy stuff.
