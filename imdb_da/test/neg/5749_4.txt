A wallflower is thrown into the sea and dreams into a pirate fantasy like a ladies in love with a pirate's apprentice. Energetic and good-natured, perhaps, but a foamy business; an unsuccessful musical send-up of "The Pirates of Penzance" with a cheap, backlot feel, wan bubblegum songs and constant, leering overactive. Kristy McNichol's film career took a real hit after this, while the senior man Christopher Atkins could not get hold of any particular feeling his voice was spinning about seeking an appropriate tone. You have to wonder if it is the best title they could come up with, what is the level of humor that will be in the script itself? The movie's "fat" -like love of musicals does not resemble its slapstick a la "Airplane!" Although McNichol seems to be overtime, it is roaring and almost makes it easy to handle. For the most part it is embarrassment. * 1/2 from ****
