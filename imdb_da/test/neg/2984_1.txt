Just saw this movie yesterday night and I almost cried. No, it wasn't because it made me completely petrified, no. It was absolutely HORRENDOUS! Sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what will be of humanity in the near future - this movie is one of them. It's as if the author, the actors, the director, et al just got together and copied and inserted scenes of their favorite horror flicks, zipped it all together and said "hi, here's Satan's whip !!!" After watching this movie, I couldn't help being bothered by the sight of people who call themselves "actors"; waltzing around as they are a kind of talented artistic interpreter ... don't be fooled they suck! Don't waste your time or money !!!
