After an ancient vein's mysterious death, a group of teenagers hold Stay Alive, a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of the Erzebet Bathory known as the blood Countess. The group starts playing the pigs game and soon they are murdered one by one in the same way as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and the reality disappears, our heroes must find a way to defeat evil blood countess. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly bad teen slasher flicking without any excitement. Writer Director William Brent Bell does not have the cunning idea of ​​making a watchable horror movie. Hope the fright is annoying, the blood / gore level is almost non-existent and the story doesn't make sense. The dialogue is completely poor and the action of everyone involved is embarrassing. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006. Stand away from this smelly ride.
