Six months after high school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a killer begins to kill the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment such as weapons: this is the bad plot of the early 80s sloasher Graduation Day, a lack of addition to the genre that gives very little in the way of style, originality or decent doing. What delivers, however, is some amazingly horrible musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen Linnea Quigley) and a nudity of nudity (a prerequisite for any slasher film!). <br /> <br /> Forget about the death scenes? They are paralyzed and rather bloodless ?? and instead enjoy the movie is more memorably crap elements: the quick editing that can induce migraine and epileptic seizures; scroll disco accompanied by a long-standing heavy rock song, 'gangster rock', performed by the unforgettable horror felony; an impromptu jamming session of school students; Christopher George hammered it up as chief red-herring Coach Michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who looks after her female students (who for some reason finds him irresistible?!?!). Towards the end of the film, the action appears a bit, with the discovery of the slaughtered children's bodies underneath the ink and a rather twisted scene with Laura's body in the hat and dress, but it comes far too late to save this movie from mediocrity.
