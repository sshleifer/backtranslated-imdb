The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal shows in "My Giant" is to say that this movie is for his career as "Ishtar" was for Warren Beatys - it didn't ruin it but it slowed it down ..... ..a lot. Crystal should know Hollywood's three golden rules: 1) Never Play Opposite a Child 2) Never Play Opposite an Animal 3) Never Play Opposite Anyone Almost 3 Meters Higher Than You Are as Innocent as a Child and "Actions" as a animals. <br /> <br /> What is this story? And comedy? I guess, but I didn't laugh, except in the scenes where Crystal is alone and not burdened by his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the aforementioned Giant. Did I mention that there is also a child in this movie? Well, forget him. The son has been brought in to make us apologize for Crystal, and we do, but for the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a fun man. If you don't believe in me, you should see him in old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live." Go Rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally." <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more important than fee-fi-pho. <br /> <br />
