You could have put the characters on the island for some reason and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the other stole one from King Kong, and ultimately (I hope) of this trilogy, history seemed to have been completely bypassed. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. It was all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth $ 8. If you have discount theater in your local area, wait and see it for a buck. I wouldn't even bother renting it. That would be too much money for this tireless thriller.
