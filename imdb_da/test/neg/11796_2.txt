There are a lot of repetitive dialogues in this movie about "cold spots" (signaling the presence of a ghost) and signs asking to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I have to repeatedly refer to cold places throughout this review. I've seen worse movies than St. The Francisville experiment, but it can be the most * forgettable * of all ("it gets cold!") Basically, some 20-somethings spend the night in a haunted house. This is filmed as an allegedly true documentary. Of course this is not true, but the house contains some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you can't predict most of the plot!). There is not much in this movie. We have the time-chained horror clich√© of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning, as a "practice" scares to warm up to the audience. People wander around with flashlights, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come to peace - that they do not harm the spirits (or cold spots) inside. Occasionally, a door will swing shut and scare someone. Of course, the ouija looks the table. They speak with a ghost name "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. More cold spots. Another door swings and a guy walks out the door. Scuff, scuff, he says. Oh my god, somebody says. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit that there is a good scene in the ceiling (where a chair is knocked out of a ghost) that has really taken care of me. But apart from a fun, bad dialogue, the chair scene (the actual split-second when it's over, nothing just before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. But there are still some cold places in here. Finally, the film ends. No one dies. No additional information is required. I wasn't a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to St. Francisville Experiment. You may not find yourself discussing whether this is a true documentary, but whether it was supposed to be fun or not. I still don't know. But whatever it was supposed to be, it failed.
