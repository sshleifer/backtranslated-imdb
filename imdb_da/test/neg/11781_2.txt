This is one of the stupidest movies ever, not the stupid mind you, but one of the stupid ones. This is 96 1/2 minutes sleep inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie is the best and funniest part, but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are a die hard Jim Varney / Ernest fan, then you like me, you should add this movie to your collection. It has short, rare moments of humor, even though they are few and far between. The mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collector's item and a must for your ernest collection. I was lucky to find this movie online at a dirt cheap price a few years ago. I think I paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. And that was the only copy I could find anywhere. Although this is a really horrible movie, it is still a must if you are a Jim Varney fan and an Ernest movie collector like I. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 2, but it is only because I have never seen a 1 before;)
