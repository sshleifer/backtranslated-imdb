A completely zero out of four. One worst summarizes Ajooba: horrible. In fact, several words come to mind: ridiculous, third rate and terrible. This is one of Amitabh's worst movies ever, he boasts in a cheap leather jacket and just as cheap tinselfolie Zorro-style mask with what seems to be wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The film is set in ancient Persia or Arabia, and is characteristic of an Indian film. As mentioned above, a leather jacket from K-Mart with velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago, unless all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also makes his patented cross-dressing in this movie. Far from being fun, it is very embarrassing to see. What could have the legendary Raj Kapoor's son flying the memory of his house like this on the screen? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you want a real laugh, get started watching this movie. The sharp discrepancies in the plot and costumes are no match for the horrible dialogues and sinister action.
