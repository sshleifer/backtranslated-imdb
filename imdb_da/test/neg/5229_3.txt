This movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, where the mysterious new shopkeeper Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers every citizen member of Castle Rock the item he or she wants most - but there is a great price for those transactions. Local Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to deal with a number of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. Below the average for the Stephen King cinema: I can see why some people would think it was boring. It stretches without offering real scary and forcing the viewer to spend time (once again) with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is eerie. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the novel and don't think this shiny movie does it justice. There are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt far too charming. We must be scaled by Gaunt at the right times, not amused by him. I also hate the fact that the sheriff's primary deputy (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as such an annoying, Barney Fife-type moron. Star Ed Harris looks as if he was forced to make this image of his agent, but professionally he is, he really sinks his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (like Pangborn's love interest Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles) come closest to creating characters who like. <br /> <br /> But it is also wild and medieval. <br /> <br /> Though I get darned if it didn't feel a little cathartically to see a bunch of unlikely movie characters, they break apart. The climate has some good explosions. <br /> <br /> I often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve, but in this case I feel like I really need to be honest and just say: 3/10.
