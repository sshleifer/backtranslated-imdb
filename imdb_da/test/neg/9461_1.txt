One of the commentator's wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson movie, and he did not die two years after this was made. He shot a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He shot this a couple of years after Dr. Gore. Patterson died in the late 70s. I know because he used my house and he left a cat there !! It also sucked. It was a big case when the movie came out. No independent horror films were made in NC. This movie didn't help. Patterson used to do good effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes in the Body shop were actually well done. The film was shot in a building that also houses a 7/11. You can actually see the top of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script looked like a kid wrote it. Only Patterson could understand. Still ... it's entertainment and it's a classic.
