I was shocked that there were 18 pages of good reviews. This must be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie did the worst because it tried so hard to be clever that it made me see it. <br /> <br /> The film's concept is comparable to an auction week on American Idol. You see, because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that this movie didn't have bad actors. So how fun would it be to have good singers trying to convince them not to get anywhere near an American Idol test? It would be pointless when this movie was. <br /> <br /> The use of improv is over-rated. We have all been in the setting where a group of friends are rolling and everyone breaks up with tears in their eyes. I feel it is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera rolls like this movie evidence. If you like the Drew Carey-hosted show of improv, you will probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the jokes were bad, the improvisation was sophomoric, and the overpowering of guest and company was campy. .. and that's my compliments for this drive. If a guy plays a trumpet AND the boiler drum at the same time, it's fun for you, fine. For me, I prefer more familiar things like "I love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> Remember, however, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980s, so maybe you would like this G-rated humor. I was waiting for someone to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us that there was no zoo in town. It is the humor you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.
