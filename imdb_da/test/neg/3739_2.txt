I love John's work as a singer, but the movie was boring and "not worth the time" to see. <br /> <br /> I thought he did an 'ok' job doing his part. When he says, "You have an affair with the oil," for his fellow stars, I have a little whining on his facial movements ... or lack of it. <br /> <br /> I would suggest the movie if you like John's music but not as a Saturday night video. <br /> <br /> If you love his music, the video has some music from him in it, but not much. <br /> <br /> So .. at best
