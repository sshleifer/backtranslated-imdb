I don't often give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. A movie can be bad because it is not a masterpiece, but it can be fun due to unintentional humor, bizarre characters, etc. An example is a large number of horror / sci-fiction films from the 1940s to the 1980s era. They are comfortable for genre buffs and guilty joyful asylum seekers because their "badness" is entertaining. However, this film has none of the humor or effective thriller scenes of the "Piranha" (1978) original. <br /> <br /> In 1995 I suppose it was the political correctness of the festivals, so doing on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with C.S.I. shows, tv is an absolute blood feast! (Good for us horror fans!) William Katt and Alexandra Paul are no Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original 1978 stars.) It is not Kat's and Paul's fault, but the authors and director who created this lukewarm turkey. How the protagonists interact is the biggest mistake in this movie. I don't want to say how that is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This television movie probably had a bigger budget than the original, but flopped as a good fate as it can be seen from the user's voices here. Stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!
