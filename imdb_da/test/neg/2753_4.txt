If you like The Three Stooges you will undoubtedly like this 17 minutes short. There were certainly some entertaining moments in it, but like all Stooges' work, it is about their particular style of slapstick comedy, and I must admit that Stooges somehow never really did it for me. Their slapstick always seemed to be sour rather than fun, and although of course it was fake, their antics always seemed more likely to cause harm than to cause laughter. In this short turn, the attempts to find Shemp (there is a professor of music in it) a slapstick, for he has just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marries within 48 hours after the will is read . One of his students is interested, but once a legacy has come out, there are a large number of different potential brides, and there is quite a good cat fight between them. Fans of Stooges will enjoy. For me, it has all the elements that drive me nuts about them. 4.10
