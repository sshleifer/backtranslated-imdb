The mask's son is a horrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a sweet couple, but it can't redeem sitting through this garbage. Although only 88 minutes (or so, say), the movie could not end up fast enough to me. The only real laugh comes in the beginning with a short look of Ben Stain. That is it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. In fact, it's just an insult to rehashes. Why was this successor made ?? This movie costs millions of dollars to make. Why should I sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented, but he has nothing to do with this movie. I'm not bothered to be good at this movie. 1.10
