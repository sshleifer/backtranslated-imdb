Talk about your wild life. Hardly a B-movie, but what the hay ... corny Sci-Fi and lesbian sex. From the mind of writer and director Cody Jarrett, a cheesy slice of fun. A chemical company is dumping waste that causes mutants in a farm. The hot Russell Russell stars as Dr. Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. She just happens to get into a lesbian relationship with the bartender Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer), and their love scenes are as good as this movie gets. A man-sized seed causes chaos; cause a car accident, rape the chemical company chief daughter, rape a girl under the ink of a football match, stiff arm tackles a runner in the football game, rape a nun ... all before being shot twice in the chest after an antidote was found clear . The special effects ... well, not special; a guy in a rubber boot without the genitals to prove himself. Hope tadpoles, will you still see it? Go ahead, but cut each witness to secrecy.
