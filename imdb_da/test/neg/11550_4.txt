"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is the first show by Jeff Daniels who writes and manages talents. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse debuts, but this one isn't that big. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba in da Moonlight" starts as a decent parody of this part of American culture. As we follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) at the 1989 threshing season, he comes close to the story of Elder Soady never to take a buck. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal cliche characters. But there is a warmth that tells you that this is not medieval. <br /> <br /> Now, the Reuben goes to The Soady Deer Camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a native American necklace, his lucky hat and two kinds of fluid you probably won't know about. In any case, she really is the only one who believes in him. He finally arrives at the camp, where his father, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting, and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will soon show. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's project this. Here are some laughs, a few moments when I chuckled loudly. But most of the jokes here are used for many times. But the biggest draw back is the spiritual / Native American happenings. Just as you familiarize yourself with the characters, these strange things arise. But the special effects are so cheap all it is is a big flash of light and then the head quickly bobing back in forward. <br /> <br /> And at the end, it's worthless. <br /> <br /> The move itself was not bad, the quirky character and fun parody were good. But it should have been. Instead of having stupid spiritual awakening, resembling rejected scenes from some demon-possessed films. <br /> <br /> I give "Escanaba in da Moonlight" a 4.5 out of 10.
