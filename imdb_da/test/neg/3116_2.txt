First, I can't see how the movie is on any "best" list or how it won any prizes. Compared to La Pianiste, who is also on a "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. This movie lacked so many things on so many different levels, but I can't quite explain why I didn't like it so much. The main actor was annoying, I felt like I never knew what was going on and I was BORDING !! Although this should be a valuable change of life that Pierre began, I would like to end it .... as soon as possible. Why should it be his sister and cousin? Ugh. And why has Thibault been meaningful? He was just bipolarly transformed. And also was it me or did I miss it all, what the guy in black was about? Who were all the people who played music in the big cellar in the big store? Why did they have all the strange equipment and weapons and all the extra space for people to live in? I mean all this, but does incest happen in French culture? European culture? I took 5 years to learn about the culture and I have never heard of it!
