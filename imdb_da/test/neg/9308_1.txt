Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. This film shows that he is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his last film and that his serious lack of success will reduce his chances of obtaining funding for future ventures. It is right up there with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saving the World" as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic is that with so many infinitely superior comic talents in Australia, such vehicles make their mark of the harsh schoolyard comedy. And to think - he had 7 years to come up with the script. True Genius!
