Arthur Miller has always been known as one of America's great dramatists for works such as "Seller's Death" and "The Crucible". "Focus" is one of his lesser-known plays brought to the silver screen. But to know what a great playwright Arthur Miller is, I doubt his original play was much like the movie. The film comes across as empty and formal, with William H. Macy as a non-Jew wrong for a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in World War II Brooklyn. Don't make me wrong: the play is okay, and I guess the people behind this movie probably tried to make a point about racism, but the movie just doesn't work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer just can't make an effective story with the material here.
