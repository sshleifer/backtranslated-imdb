The box is why I originally downloaded this movie and my back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been beaten. I thought this movie would be something like a Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the stupidest I've seen for a long time. The unreported version teases you to see, but will totally disappoint you. The play was horrible and sound effects just gaudy. It seemed very low budget with the whole setting going on in the same building. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon put its name on this. DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT RENT IT. Don't waste 2 hours in your life on this.
