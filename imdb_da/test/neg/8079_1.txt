When I saw this shot, it reminded me of the movie Title FIRE, which is where this waste belongs to a fire. I don't even know what to say the actor was blowing, the fire so really fake, Andy the chicks are not just supermodels. And finally, I don't know what you people are complaining about, I own this damn movie, yes, I'm happy about it. I think it could be worse I could look for backwards 2. And to make matters worse I have the whole set on DVD fire, volcano, earthquakes, avalanches. All I miss is the amazing tornado movie that I hear sucking balls. <br /> <br /> Well, until my next crap movie peace
