While traveling by train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​mistakenly enters a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. First, she finds that a strange lonely point (Jim van der Woude) who does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that it was the last train in that track. The man lodges her in his house, and they develop an unusually wordless relationship between them. <br /> <br /> "De Wisselwachter" is an overstated boredom, with another but uninteresting story that doesn't go anywhere. I like movies Off-Hollywood, but this story is too absurd and has no message at last. The sexual tension between the two main characters is fun in a moment, but too repetitive. I watched this movie in an old VHS and the picture is too dark; I don't know if the picture would be of better quality on DVD. Eventually, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The Man of the Line")
