Have you ever noticed how many really bad movies attract so many 10/10 votes? Not much of a riddle how it happens, but it's not much of a movie. There are two ways to look at it being given away in Mail on Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free so you can't complain too much. 2. It's free, so it can't be very good. <br /> <br /> My vote is number 2. The free DVD in Sunday papers is a new trend and some good old movies have been released. They are the ones who have been out for years and have made the most of the money they will ever make, so it's a matter of everything else is a bonus. It's the last stop for old movies, not the first for new, so you can guess how bad it should be to skip TV and DVD rentals. <br /> <br /> The pluses are that Vinnie Jones is trying hard and Derek Jacobi is good as Dickens. The minus points are a longer list. Trying is not the same as succeeding poor Vinnie and Jacobi's other tramp character are talkative hams who have gone away. The story is very weak. Dickens story has nothing to do with the film's murder and feels like another movie turned on the script to get people to believe it is a British Dan Brown without religion. The support aids are either there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave must be really hard) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. It is also very, very long after what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie takes his priceless Dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere, it's good for a few laughs, but that's it. Not fun and not very good even for free.
