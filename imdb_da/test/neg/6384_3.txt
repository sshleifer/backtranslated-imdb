I've seen this movie and honestly was quite disappointed. And in my opinion, this movie lacks the heart. I honestly didn't care what happened to the characters at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was so much they could have done with the movie that they didn't do because they either got so raped to try to be unclear and make a deep comment on life or try so hard not to that the signs and the story were completely lost at all. I have seen another picture of this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this movie lacking in the other and the other, and I was left wondering what the meaning was, or if the point in the movie was that it had no point. Honestly, while I didn't want to pull my hair out under the film, I was hurting the lost time on the sad little movie. I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but honestly I didn't.
