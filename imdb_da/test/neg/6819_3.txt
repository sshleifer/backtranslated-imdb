sure this movie might have had its fun moments with the questioning people and I know the movie should not be completely credible. The film made it too scandalous, for example, a girl like that would never go out with her guy for a million years as well as people in movies who had sharp performances that acted so badly. Also plotted badly they could have a better work on scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and became really boring after the first few jokes, it was like 10mins was laughter so the old one when is this will end up to kick the bottom line, if you want an incredible act mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance move on and watch this movie.
