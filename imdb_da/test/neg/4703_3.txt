So that's where Columbia's head of their short subjects unit got his director off, eh? Yes, no one other than Mr. Jules White, who is credited (or is it rather "exposed") as director of this entry in the MGM's DOGVILLE series. Given medkredit as co-director is a Zion Myers; whose name is unknown to us so far. Mr. Meyers was without a doubt the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and "action". In short, he must have been a dog trainer on the set. <br /> <br /> The title of this comedy card is undoubtedly a game of the MGM feature in the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; like star Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast support. We must invoke ignorance of this title; has not looked up to this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we have read about the movie *; not to mention some particular character-specific gags. For example, we observed a dog prison that stemmed and derived, correctly, that the bow-wow actor mimicked character comrade Roscoe Ates. We later crossed with the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto, his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, one fit for Holmes & Watson!) THE PRACTICE FOR LAMPONING popular features were already a tried and true exercise within the comedy card. It was one that seemed to make no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the big films; but quite the opposite received lots of passive approval. After all, imitation is said to be the sincere form of flattery; In addition, every manufacturer would like to offer some apparently irreverent parodies. ** As for the movie, we found it to be interesting in some kind of perverse way. To see so many of "Man's best friends" being so artificially animated in a long and dull kind of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to us who make up the audience. I just mean how many pooches were made to bend, unnecessarily to achieve the illusion of "talking"? <br /> <br /> When it comes to pets, or "Animal Companions" that the politically correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; not only favors dogs but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We do not like to see an animal exploited in such a fun, expanded play format. <br /> <br /> As unusual as it may seem, it is the move that Mr. Jules White made from MGM's Shorts to climb Columbia's 2 Reeler production seems to have been not just a $ tep in the finance $; but al $ o in the Artic content. We never thought it was the Producer-Director for similar luminaries like 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who had probably seen better days like Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a step up in movies. <br /> <br /> In case, we haven't made our point yet; We are officially panoramic. Then see it at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We read excellent accounts for both THE BIG HOUSE and Laurel & Hardy send-up, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** The prison image became a separate genre; everyone is due to a debt to the big house. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and its director made a first class spoof, the first of many; for a prison comedy became a necessary theme for so many a screen fun to come.
