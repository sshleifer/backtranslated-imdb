This is a very boring movie with poorly developed characters, subplotters that do not go down, and barely tolerable plays. It comes across as a poorly thought out rip-off of "2001." The only thing that makes it worthwhile is sets and costumes and visual effects. But even that was not enough to prevent me from nodding. I would like to have the soundtrack, especially the music during the spacecraft sequence, for nights when I have trouble falling asleep.
