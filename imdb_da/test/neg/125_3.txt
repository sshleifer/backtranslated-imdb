It is a completely transparent film with a couple of half-timed sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot are not sensible and seem to be added to the useful life. The final plot is of a very basic type that does not leave the viewer guessing and any turnarounds are obvious from the start. The final stage with the flask back does not make sense since they are added in and appear to have little relevance to the van lady's character. Not really worth seeing again, a little disappointed with the final production, although it is clear that it was shot on a low budget, some shots and sections in the film are of poorly-directed quality
