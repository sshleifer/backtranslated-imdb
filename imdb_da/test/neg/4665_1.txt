This movie has poor writing and poor editing. It is difficult to follow what is going on because none of the signs make much sense. Some major accidents occur every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" sequences are at all interesting. The movie is two hours worth of "throwing" scenes that are only associated with sharing shared actors. This movie doesn't even have a sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
