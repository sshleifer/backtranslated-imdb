My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable television on a lazy Saturday night as they thought it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. At this promise, at least the film delivers: her character is ineffective, and complies with almost all scare-type horror movie clich√©s. Like the movie. A cataloging of its studied compliance with them would be an exercise with recall of something I hope to forget quickly so I will not make one. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the red herring: Everyone is guilty, rather than just the two who suspect from the beginning. The "rule out logical and obvious and what's left is the" bad horror movie rule works well on this one. The only surprise to have any influence on me was its final snagging of the indefinite final cliche: Jane will keep her deal with her tried rescuer who will tell her the (obvious to the public) identity of the second conspiracy that drives her into another round of hysterical victim play. Mercifully I will never know.
