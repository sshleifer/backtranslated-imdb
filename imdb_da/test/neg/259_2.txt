Where do I start with this movie. All I know is that it's a mess. Be the script, the story or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing from Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Have Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this. Second Rani gets very annoying, appearing in every silly movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (happy Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but destroys the fun movie. The dialogues are missing. Maybe I laughed here and there, but entertained? NONE!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the above movie, but here he is insane. His character is poorly written. One minute he is poor and in the next moment you wonder how he is poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like an ordinary jain and did not make any effort. Luckily, she fulfilled her career with Saathiya because her career went haywire around this time. Pooja Batra puts a little charm here with her appearance, but it's still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. The beauty and play of Kashmira Shah has run away from her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful, but puts a little bit of performance. Mohnish Behl receives the award for Worst (Supporting) actress (they need Razzie because there have been horrible movies in India). He says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks strange and is not in his ordinary form. Just to tell you, there is more to the cast, which is also terrible. If it wasn't for Raveena's amazing beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I wouldn't give the movie a point. Otherwise, the dance of Salman was horrible. Pooja Batra danced like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I would wish the costumes got a makeover and the rest of the casting (and their duck dance) had been blown away from the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya, who does not have a good enough billing. The same goes for halfway decent title song. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) is a no-no for everyone.
