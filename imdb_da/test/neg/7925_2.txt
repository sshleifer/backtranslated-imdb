This movie is so stupid that I want my $ 2.99 back, which I paid for !! First, this movie begins with a bunch of wooden actors with the filling of talent as if they were picked from the street somewhere, because the "real" actors either didn't come up because of the ridiculous script or they just couldn't get anyone desperate to make this movie! The music in this movie is enough to put you in bed, flute music made for faerie dancing in the desert would not even be good enough for this movie! And the guy dressed up as Satan looks like he's all dressed in a K-Mart Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except for a few lame scenes. When I saw what the terrible kills looked like in the bathrobes with Nosferatu faces, I just laughed! This is what the whole city should run away from once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I've ever seen. Avoid this!
