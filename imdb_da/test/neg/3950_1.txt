Talk about false advertising! I wasted an hour and twenty-five minutes watching this piece of crap, and there wasn't a casual wear, not a platform shoe, no pointy-finger dance, and not a single disco ball. I saw it on a Saturday night and ended with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with the music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, you ask yourself the question: "Where did the rope come from and will it hang me too?" From the pristine bias towards the Pennsylvania Dutch force, to the shameless promotion of Alienware portable batteries' seemingly eternal capacity, to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from Japanese cinema, this is the worst movie to beat theaters since The Grudge.
