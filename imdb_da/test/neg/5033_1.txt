I turned it off within the first five minutes. It is very sick and disturbing, the moment I struck it was when the beautiful white horse was slaughtered in the slaughterhouse, and it had to be punctured by a small pipe instrument. This creature lay on the floor of a shock before it died. The narrator said that the animal dies instantly, it did not. I do not agree with graphic realism on animals, insects or living creatures. I was very disappointed when I had just seen 'Eyes Without a Face', which was a brilliant movie, and this short film was attached, which spoiled my night - since I couldn't hurt a fly, so it's nothing to see on this miss documentary. /> <br /> Reading other reviews on this site, I noticed that they used words as aesthetic - it's not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.
