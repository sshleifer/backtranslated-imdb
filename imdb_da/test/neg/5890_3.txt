I just watched this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews I expected a good, emotional sports movie. What I got was somewhat clumsy and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw that the star was hurt long before the fight. I might have thought they would wait for him to collapse until you know the game before the "big", but I think the first game is good enough. The parenting relationship was also very clich√©, with the dominant drunk father (I would say that McGraw impressed me) and the boy who wants to stay and help his (scary?) Mother. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the movie for every 5 minutes, and simply placed it to get the football players some action from the pitch. I thought "ok, now how does this work in the plot again?" Maybe I missed the point beyond "Now they play football in a city that loves it, so the girls throw themselves to their feet" points. <br /> <br /> The sport had some good points but most of it was so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than mounting the entire playoffs! And I wasn't so sure of the continuity of the shut-down clock in the last game. <br /> <br /> I could see that I could see this movie winning ESPY for best sports movie if it was the only one released. However, I found it to be a dreary film full of people who are seriously obsessed with the pigskin. For a better football movie, see Remember Titans.
