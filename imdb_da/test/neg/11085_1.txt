My first post on IMDb must (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with The Cavern! There is no history, no character development, no scary and no good lighting. It makes no sense. If you enjoy bad acting, people who run through small portions of caves, jumping cameras in bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in full darkness, you'll love this movie. I could close the lights in my house and scream too and I wouldn't have to pay for the rent. The only thing that scared me was that someone actually made a movie here horrible. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
