As an indie filmmaker, I at least try to make a decent movie. This piece ____ was out of budget. It was shot on video and not least 24P mini-DV at least. The look of this was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at ShowBiz Expo in LA, and he talked about the book, Film-making for dummies, which he put together. I thought this little video should be something, but I think I was wrong. He could have raised the value a bit by shooting 16mm movies instead of the horrible video. The plot was stupid as well as the actor and all the fake green screens and sound and the entire nine yards. I had the choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. Damn!!!!! I bought JoyRide, who was a hell of a movie. Perhaps the instructor should read real movie books about film production and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget girl. Perhaps he should learn from the masters who did, the night of the living dead and the evil death and chain saw the massacre. Just to name a few of the all-time low budget great hits. This is a video that should have been dead. I can't call it a movie because he didn't use movies.
