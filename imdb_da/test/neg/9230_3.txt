People call a 976 "party line" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet for a sexual equality. A horrified, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother uses the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they do not discriminate! A couple of sixteen year old girls also call the line of fun and pretend to be older of course. One of them acts as a babysitter to a married man who is warm to her (or someone). Meanwhile, a vice-politician is borrowed from murder when he is the first to discover one of the siblings. He is with a female assistant from the District Attorney. <br /> <br /> Nothing special here. Richard Roundtree has a little more than a cameo as the police chief. One of the dirty talking 16-year-olds is played by an actress who also said Peanut's character Peppermint Patty! According to IMDb, the other died very young, just several years after this movie: sad.
