One of the movies where there are no big words at all, and you can predict pretty much what should happen. Matt dillon was once again great, but the rest didn't play a bigger role as they should. It was exciting at first, but a little slow and predictable in the end. It is one of those flicks where the good guy wins whatever happens. If you absolutely have nothing to do, try it out, I personally didn't find it worth seeing. The story could have been more interesting, and the director could have made it less of a B movie by constructing a happy ending.
