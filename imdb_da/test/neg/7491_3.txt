The C-Class's caste and badly transmitted scenes, complete with horrible plays, have also led me to believe that this would make a good TV release such as The FX presentation of a poker's outbreak. At my local blockbuster, however, approx. 9 copies on the shelves, none of which were checked out when I rented the title (I wonder why ....) Nevertheless, the title was almost ridiculous in the "fear factor" the director went for. The whole "death count" on the bottom of the screen generally opposed the plot, such as When the helicopter crossed Angola and the toll was running at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24. But when the movie ends (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the helicopter is landed), the dead counter is reset to what it was the moment the helicopter approached the area. The movie ended a great whole throughout the plot, and God knows that no one is waiting for the successor. Anyway, don't rent this, I only recommend seeing this if you've achieved the title without monetary losses and you're in the mood for a cheesy thrill.
