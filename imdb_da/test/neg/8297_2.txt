I wondered when someone would try to turn the entire Matamoros root into a goreporn image. Anyroad, here are a few things I learned about Mexico from watching this movie. <br /> ~ All Mexican women are superheme - remember the little desert town in Unearthed? Yes, it must be the Mexican sister town. Don't even bother with hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. She gets as hot as prostitutes and probably has no children too! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is ruled by crazy Satan-worshiping Palo Mayom beasts. Â¡Ay, caramba! The other half, which everyone here in the United States knows, is run by drug dealers. Fortunately, this does not disturb much of the sex-tourisim trade and our ultra-low wage factories down there. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican police are useless. Don't go to them. Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chicken behind the counter what happened to your missing friend. She will be far more helpful than the police. <br /> <br /> ~ When you are cruelly tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists, do not resume Psalms or any part of the Bible. You just want to pull up the mojo.
