Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice action was perfect for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so in this movie; most of the concept. Then the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated card, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this film consists entirely of a joke that lasts too long. <br /> <br /> Weathers, pronounced by Ludicrous, have several raw and fun lines. Unfortunately, the whole boy's pet's rat is good for not contributing anything to the story. Eventually, I grew up as sorry for his remarks as I did the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of South Park and other animation aimed at adults. I also play several online pimp games, so I'm partly into pimps stories. The transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant; But after that, both the story and the dialogue became superfluous and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a five. It is worth looking at the great concept and voice shop. Just don't expect much else or you'll be quite disappointed.
