Done in a mock-documentary style, late 60's sub-complexes and alleged general government prosecutors have been arrested and given a choice. For conviction for their wrong actions, there is the opportunity to go to prison for 7 years for life or spend three days and two nights in a Southern California desert at Punishment Park. In 100 degree heat, the prisoners have to pull fifty some odd miles into a US flag for their freedom. US and state law enforcement officers follow two hours last. If the dissidents are trapped, it means imprisonment. Appearance in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
