Well, finally a view of this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy of it, horrible copy filled with green drops, editing is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has the horrible elevator and sometimes you can even hear the camera recording. All in all, it's too dark, a waist time to say, but it's not. It's a little slow, the first half of the movie is all talking and loving each other. It is even odd that the girls in the 60's movies never have bras. When they enter the bedroom, it is full of glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the video nasties list. The reason is simple, it's gory for their time. It really has some unpleasant dismemberement's and it's scary in some way due to the fact that it's filmed handycam way. So every shot the picture moves, things they do these days with steadycam. The horrible Ones could have been better if the quality of the movie was better, but still better than other movies of the time as Schoolgirls In Chains.
