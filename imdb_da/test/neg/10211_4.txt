In 1989, here in NZ wrestling was something of a mega-hype phenom, and who was steering the asterisk on the hill was the orange goblin itself, HULK HOGAN (one of my uber-heroes at this time), so it works obvious to me now why i loved this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a shockingly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lists are worse !!! The story follows a standard WWE (then WWF) approx. 88-91 story line culminating in the standard good guy knocks down, sobs up and then gets knocked down again the story line to follow that good guy calls on all his inner strength (achieved by eating vitamins, say beans, etc. etc .) to mount the epic coming back ..... Real standard formula here. Worth to see if only to lessen your youth !!!!
