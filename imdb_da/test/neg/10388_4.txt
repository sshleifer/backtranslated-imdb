I agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erikson did a good job of playing the obsessed girl, I do not seriously think that Isabelle, the character she played, was obsessed. I have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse and they have never made it clear whether the father has actually abused her or not. I also had to see some parts of it again to make clear what the letter said, what the names of the characters were, and I'm still not aware of a few things that happened whether they were real or not. I'm trying to find the "original" story it was based on to compare facts, but I can't seem to find anything about it online. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. Special effects wise, the movie was not bad for a class B, pretty much, and the possessive scenes made it all worth it ... that is, if you have nothing better to do. LAUGH OUT LOUD
