This is one of those movies where I am rowing for the one who could finish the movie the fastest. I'd like to see the police kill Keaton AND Garcia to get it over with. Basically, this is the deal - Two police have to die, and one-third have to get horrible burns on his face for Garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer Keaton. Is it worth it? None!
