Bobcat Goldthwait should be commended for trying to do something different with this surprisingly in-depth movie, a pitfall warning to be honest about everything. Melinda Hamilton stars like Amy, a girl who previously had oral sex with a dog on a lark. She's struggling to tell her fiance, John. Of course, the truth makes the back ugly head. The film deals with the fall of the escapade. The movie is well-acted by everyone, except perhaps for Jack Plotnick as Dougie, who never really felt he was mashing well with the picture.
