Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors who had ever adorned the screen. He could easily shift from dramatic roles to comedic with ease and make most of his comrades green with envy. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is Oscar-worthy, I feel it was given to him as he had missed his other opportunities to win the prize because of other, better roles that had preceded this present. <Br /> <br /> This is also one of the pretentious movies coming out to showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case a particular member. It's too bad that the screenwriter's output didn't match Lemmons. Don't waste your time with this one.
