In addition, BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE are described for its various publications. This Australian film, shot in New South Wales, is problematic for its producers from the start because of numerous personality conflicts and prolonged shooting time, which prematurely uses its assigned budget, and although history is sometimes nicely detailed, under standard post-production finishing and wholly cutting jettison's affair. Tom Skerritt plays as Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with a "passion for the building" who is creating a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region and at the same time unaware that his business partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) has insured incomplete structure $ 10 million, far more than its actual value, and planning its destruction due to normal summer brush fires to gather a splendid sum through fraud. In line with this illegal scheme, Fane arranges an arsonist to perform the fire, a young man who is also the girlfriend of Anderson's daughter and because the future resort is in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector (one of the many inexplicable elements of the manuscript) Julian have every expectation that his shabby design will come without serious hindrance. When the local insurance company who is the victim of the crime is majority owned by Fane, the politically-skeptical underwriters of politics, Lloyd's of London, senior researcher George Engels (James Mason) implement to investigate the nature of the crime, because of death. , possibly a murder, by an insurance researcher (Wendy Hughes) who, by following instructions, was apparently close to the cause of the arson. The setting for the movie is the week before Christmas, the main stone for the summer in Antipodes, a dramatic background, but the links in the story are not smoothly compounded, resulting in presentation of events that are quite difficult for a seer to follow, a problem increased by irregular editing , the mentioned heavy cutting and poor sound and picture quality. Skerrit's semi-comatose and drone style are poorly invalidated by this faint sound processing, but Mason is very effective as always and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes as the premature investigator; Doleman wins actors with his achievements as the malicious Julian Fane.
