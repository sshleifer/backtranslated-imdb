This film tries to be artistic, but comes across just as pueril as a film school student's first attempt. Next, it tries to be erotic, but comes across as clumsy as a maid's first attempt. Finally, trying to be cruel and poignant, but apart from Kinsky's performance - which is powerful but conspicuously wrongly placed opposite the amateur melodrama - is just as poignant as your hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering how not erotic this movie is). It has a blowjob scene that is even lamer than ChloÃ« Sevigny's career-funeral performance in The Brown Bunny. Run away now while you have the chance. Instead of a Victoria's Secret underwear catalog, it is more artistic and more erotic than this tripe.
