As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, I can't see the movie as a movie either. As a movie, there are some amazingly beautiful ships on the ship, most of them carried on an existing vessel - except those in the disaster scenes of course and a certain space under the deck. But as far as the history and the dialogues are concerned, I can only call it big shit. None of this would happen like this on a true sailing vessel. No wonder the movie had a bad impact on the existing ship - if I didn't know better, I wasn't tempted to do a safe voyage. It is destined for Europeans, I recommend turning off when the ship runs around. Then the over-emotional, very American part begins, which I could not bear. The pictures are really, really amazing, no wonder in a Ridley Scott movie, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it gets much better.
