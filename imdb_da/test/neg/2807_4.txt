As mentioned in other comments, the biggest problem with NVA is that it cannot determine what it will be, slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the East German army. There are a few moments that are moving right, for example, when one of the recruits returns from the Schwedt army prison with a completely broken personality. But eventually Leander Hau√ümann goes to the infantile humor. No wonder the movie flopped at the German cashier's office as it is historically unlikely to face the real situation in the training camps and led by an actor who unfortunately is unable to give a sophisticated performance. <br /> <br /> However, there is camera work by Frank Griebe who - as always - does a wonderful job. If it wasn't for his beautiful pictures, I'd have rated the movie much worse.
