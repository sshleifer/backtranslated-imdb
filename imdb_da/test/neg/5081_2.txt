these people who told me "this movie is good" - shame on them! This movie is for the audience who has no problem watching everything (especially when it comes to hard guys, guns, chases and hoists). movie with "The Inside Man" {the same time series}. I'm tired of copying and pasting movies.and I'm unhappy, but what can I do? Fans of these types of movies are much more .... If you want to see a good movie of that type, I recommend you "Lucky Number Slevin". I'm not mean I just don't like this movie {weak actors, weak script, weak action}. Probably another will like it. Many people - many tastes. BUT FOR ME "CHAOS" IS SMALL!
