It's hard to make it through this movie without choking on its own, to be honest. The creepy animation doesn't help, as it looks like it's a decade-old video you'd find in Morrison's 99p bin. Still, it's better than the unpleasant script that spends about one-third of its length on extraneous extras such as Bella's contemporary issues, things about Scrooge's father and lots of charmless find-choke - TO ANTROPOMORPHIC MICE. These bizarre additions eat screen time at the expense of items that you think would be quite important, as Dickens dialogue and key pieces of his plot - the movie buggers up for example twenty questions and sometimes fails to put scenes in the right order. Totally hopeless.
