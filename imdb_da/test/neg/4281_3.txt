Being a big fan of Disney, I was really disappointed when I saw this shot. The animation was beautiful, and backgrounds were amazing, but I think good animation does not constitute a weak script and weak story. I have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children. Yes, there are some deaths in the movie, but isn't death something children should at least be exposed to? But I go down. The script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes ... the kind I could expect from most dream work movies. The music was rocky, the morale was forced (and forced without any charm). And the characters would burst into the song at completely inappropriate times. The characters were also cold, and I really couldn't encourage any kind of feeling to them (bore irritation). I'm a big fan of the jungle book, Aladdin, and the Emperors new groove, but this Disney movie was a total and complete waste of time ..... don't see it !!!
