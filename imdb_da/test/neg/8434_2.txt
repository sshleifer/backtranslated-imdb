And one of them is bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human variety, not fish. This is not the Dante-directed "Piranha" of '78 (which had the fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha." A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, join a local hunter / staircase called Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not aware of William Smith's film CV that plays Caribe; otherwise they would have known immediately that he was the villain of the play. Smith may also have refused to film the end or cut out before they joined the movie (see the end of this comment). As mentioned elsewhere, this image has a lot of fillers - long shots of the local wildlife (birds) - and the central set piece, a motorcycle race that goes too long. The reason why this becomes another star from me is, of course, William Smith, who can't save this slam, but once again shows why he was "going to" guy 30-35 years ago if you needed a really unpleasant villain; His best, Smith could be very scary. He is the type who enjoys killing, possibly in a sadistic way, and you get the sense of the evil grin that he usually puts on when a mood hits him. Physically, he is very impressive, and you know that the other 3 characters are quite doomed within the first half hour. This was what Smith brought most of his roles; It seems hopeless for the other signs against this male monster. Unfortunately, the movie continues with muddy stuff at last, as if a minute of recordings were lost - a confusing, incomplete climax.
