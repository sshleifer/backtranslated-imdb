If you want to watch the worst movie ever made, look no further. Some miserable movies are visible because they are inadvertently fun. Alas, American Movie has no meaning at all, no accidental humor, just obscenities thought of the director to be ridiculous. For those who liked this movie, I suggest you look at Kevin Smith's "Clerks" in tone. In Clerks you will find creativity, humor and enjoyment - all on a great budget. It should make you forget this horrible effort.
