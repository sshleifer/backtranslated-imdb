Okay, don't make a mistake - this is a pretty horrible movie, but I actually thought it had a few scary scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. At least it is inadvertently fun in spots and has a clear air of creepy and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). <br /> <br /> This baby falls into the "so badly entertaining" category for me, and alone, I would give it a star. The effects are terrible, the play is uncomfortable and it all looks like it was shot in one day. You must also love the toy ship at the beginning! It brought childhood memories to see this in a dozen TV many years ago. While Alpha DVD print looks weak and as if it was recorded directly by an old TV show or something, I actually liked it in this case!
