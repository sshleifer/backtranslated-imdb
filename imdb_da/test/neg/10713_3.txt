In three quarters of an hour, history gradually develops into a swinging point of some sort. Although it's overloaded with scenes that just seem to be dull to viewers and lure him away from the plot itself, something happens. It is not much, and it is certainly not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and history driving gives no depth or insight into the entire casting of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all. Everyone is about to spin and center around their own cliché and role - the sweet, friendly star-star girl; fighting überwoman, the snobbish aristocrat. The male leader doesn't seem to be any difference at all; he's a low degree of presence that doesn't actually matter, since he's only there because the storyboard demanded him - it seemed he was on vacation and was caught up. When it comes to turning the corner in relation to what is happening, the film first turns completely blank for a few minutes and becomes so ridiculous. It solves - or better - dissolves - itself with a by-the-book Deus Ex Machina, several clichés and some of the coolest plot units and choices I've ever seen. It's history, okay. First, the film is a drama, even if it should be comical, and then it becomes a father. The protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises. However, the first set of some serious antagonists is replaced by a couple who are literally just bored. Maybe it was a kind of nod to the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie does not get any bonus from me to the underlying philosophical meaning (since there is none) or to the technical realization. The animation and editing is fair and then the sound mix; but it is by no means excellent or even over the average Japanese productions in the late 1980s. In fact, the visuals treat static, uninspired and unoriginal. <br /> <br /> Worst of all - it totally avoids entertaining, even if you don't have trouble with characters and all the stuff. There is too little going on here and the rest is at best corny. Get a real Ghibli instead, party with it and keep your fingers away from it.
