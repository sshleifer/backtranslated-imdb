I thought there might be something for this movie and got through it all. I can summarize by saying that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie started OK, I think the original characterization of Herc was true to the myths. Both as a child and as a young adult he began quite strong, but not the brightest bulb. But later, he transforms into a charismatic speaker's loved one of all. Huh? <br /> <br /> Other problem: horrible CGI. Satyr looked OK, but the rest of the critters looked just awful, especially Hart, the phoniest-looking Beast in the movie. And how did Leelee Sobieski's skin come golden sometimes, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone had to cringe this - was Hercules twelve work. Because the producers obviously did not want to cover them all; Perhaps they thought that the primitive screw heads that looked at this waste could not count so high. Instead of the TWELVE mazes of Hercules, we got the five works of Hercules. Yes, the five works! WTF?!? He didn't even finish the last one so it was really 4 1/2 work! Just awful. I take Hercules: The legendary journeys over this piece of nap on any day of the week.
