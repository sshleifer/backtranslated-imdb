I know the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, especially a shot-by-shot remake. I think it is more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there is far more wrong with this movie than that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white, but what few people realize is that the original was shot after color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcocks. Now, it should not be said that remake should have been converted into black and white, but the colors of this movie are far too wrong. The most prevalent colors in the film are orange and green, especially on Marion, which should not be a flashy character. The bright colors make it look like a happy movie, and when horrible events take place in those color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything, and the audience tends to laugh rather than scream. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the lighting. This is a dark dark tale that should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake did not only fail in this, but seemed to go in the OPPOSIT direction. Most scenes are very bright even when it is illogical to do so because it is at night! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, he pulls Norman Bates' discomfort and insanity off quite well, I do not deny him. But there is one element to the sign he couldn't show: the softness. There must be some misleading kindness to the character, at least initially, which then falls away when we realize the truth about him. Apart from being a trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized feature of ALL PSYCHOPATHS !!!! <br /> <br /> There are a few good aspects of this movie. Some of the performances are good. As said, Vince Vaughn said very close to drawing a decent portrayal of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been terrible, but unlike Janet Leigh, who was unintentionally announced as one of the film's biggest stars, Anne Heche was given the last billing in the opening credit. I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho short story that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock movie, but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. I now wish that I had bought the book and saved the comment because the subsequent comment may be the funniest thing I've ever seen. There was no attempt in this movie to hide the fact that it was a rip off of the original and it would be far more credible if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton monkey from the planet Zafroomulax . So many shots were copied exactly without any real thought of why Hitchcock had put the original shot that way. Such as the scene where Sam and Lila speak while their faces are completely covered in shade. Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shade because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so no one could see their horrible beliefs, not for any artistic or stylistic purpose. In other words, my review is about as meaningless as the movie itself, because it replicates something that has already been said. Like everyone else here, I recommend that you don't waste your time on this movie and get the original.
