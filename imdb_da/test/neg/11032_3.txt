Taran Adarsh ​​a renowned critic praised such a dub film <br /> <br /> The film has a weird story where a lover sells his love for a brothel because he wants money to save his mother and then also gets Forgotten the LOL <br /> The movie is crazy <br /> <br /> the first half focuses on romance, comedy that doesn't work. Twist shocks, but the whole other half is a mess and the climax is cliché <br /> <br /> Direction by Aditya Datt is bad Music is typically Himesh <br /> <br /> Emraan makes his serious role good but his wardrobe , his way of going through songs.etc looks like his former movie Geeta Bhasra annoying Ashmith Patel fails to convince this actor was good at MURDER only so far and then a downhill Mithun some screen time and he is okay but his degradation in a song is forced Ranjeet is okay
