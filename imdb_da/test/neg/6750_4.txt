This was of course a low budget film. It shows in all scenes. It is great to see where it was made. Much of the film was shot in Columbia, CA, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Sonora, CA. Some of the film was also shot in Jamestown, CA, very close to Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, which was "Back to the Future III".
