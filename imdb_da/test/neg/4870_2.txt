This movie is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it was ever created. For example, they enter the sewer from the Capitol and while they are in the sewers, you can see signs pointing to different public buildings, and then they come up in the middle of the street! I very much doubt that public buildings will give public access through the city's sewer system. Anyways, I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value. I laughed all the way through the idiot of everyone involved in this movie.
