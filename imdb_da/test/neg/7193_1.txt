Well, don't bother. This movie looks so tired, the play is so old-fashioned, and the plot and the characters then strike it to be studied instead of looking. It really is a terrible waste of film; Stereotypes, clich√©s, nonsense and amateurish filmmaking. I saw it in incredibly awe with my mouth open. How could such a movie be made, and more interesting, how could anyone find it fun or tough? Old, tired, sloppy ... a junior high shit at best. There is nothing to see there, except for a study of very old films. Not a good movie, just old. This is not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. This is nonsense. The action is so bad that it might be worth seeing just for the laughs. Some movies are so bad they are good. But this goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again.
