I wasted my time. This is very pretentious movie. In the beginning you will think there is something going on, but within approx. 30 minutes you go into the idea that nothing happens. I waited another 20 minutes and then I was so frustrated that I started reading reviews on IMDb and realized that the director has wasted precious time for so many people. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring pointless movie. Stay away. So many good soundtracks. I will give a point to the police inspector joke because it worked for me. I laughed for a long time, but otherwise a very bad movie. Get Away.1 at 10.
