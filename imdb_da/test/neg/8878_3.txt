This is not exactly a complicated story. It is not a mystery or plot that you need to take time to look again because you missed an in-depth part of the dialogue. Recalling a movie has to be seen several times, so you can 'get' it for a few movies, but it's not one of them. These types of movies have substance and are so involved that it is easy to miss an important part of the dialogue or a subtle nuance to plot information that you may have overlooked. This is not the case with Goys Ghosts. The biggest mistake in this movie is lack of detail. It jumps from one sign to the next, and never gives any substance to a set of scenes to allow the inclusion of those who see. Because of that, you do not associate with any of the characters. You do not come to the point where you care. Either the main actor is gone, just as the movie seems to redeem itself or their actions are despicable and you are not inclined to do so anyway. Goy's refusal to go very far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to commit further reflects the overall tone of his side. The only signs that you may instantly feel like are Ines when she is questioned and then tortured. After her rape at Lorenzo, every focus on her character is virtually gone. Then comes the only one in depth from the best scenes in the movie centered around Lorenzo's invitation to supper with Ines' family, and her fathers are trying to force Lorenzo to sign a false announcement and get his daughter back. So as things start to develop again, they are away from the movie. I have read many of the comments here on how the film did not know what it would be, etc. I found out that it was basically not successful. From Lorenzo's return and the random display of Ines' daughter of Goya, everything seemed to be nothing more than constructed. Without much of a story, no effort was made to really investigate the turbulent times they lived in. The essence of who Goya was was not materialized, except for his actions or lack thereof, which turned out to be more self-centered than something else. Regarding his art, the film seemed to try to investigate some of the paintings he did, but again another opportunity to study the reactions to this work frittered away instead of the work itself. To summarize the best, the film had no connection, it lacked virtually the substance to dive into the historical environment it included, and afterwards you left it as you had just seen was a series of interrupted attempts to engage the viewer to switch from one thing to the next without sufficient contact with the viewer in any of them. You can't see anything like this several times and expect it to be improved with the added study. There just isn't enough to waste time. It is not the case that you miss something, it would just be more proof that the ingredients were needed to make this movie good, just not there. What about the best movie ever made? It's not even the best movie I've seen today.
