Dr. Markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting and trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he goes to a piano concert, he is hit by the pianist's beautiful daughter and sets out to wake her. But when she has nothing to do with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure. This is the basic prerequisite for this B-grade low budget thriller. I must say I was underwhelmed by this movie. Not that it was terrible - it wasn't, but there was nothing particularly remarkable either. It was entertaining enough for viewing, but not one that will remain in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is a bit corny at times, and the play is just mediocre. The story is pretty predictable and doesn't give us anything new. Of course, I can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit that serves almost no real intention and a doctor with a Svengali-like stirring that doesn't express his victims. <br /> <br /> It may be worth seeing if you like this kind of movie, but don't go into it with too many expectations.
