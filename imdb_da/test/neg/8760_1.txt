Always enjoy the Classic Horror movies, but this movie was really a waste of time, and if it wasn't for John Carradine to play the mad doctor who is able to control humans through his experiments. This film was made during World War II, and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the whole world. Bob Steele plays in many roles as a cowboy or gangster, and in this picture, Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this movie and acted like this was his first movie. Mantan Moreland, (Jeff) gave a great performance with great comedy that helped keep the audience alert. I hate to criticize a movie made in 1943, but it's really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula through many films in the 1940s, you just like to see John do his best.
