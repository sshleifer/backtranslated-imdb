The DVD "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender, was released in 2001. It did not go to German cinemas, and neither the director nor an actor could receive an important prize for this movie. The film refers to the Shakespeare game "The Tempest", published in the late 16th century. The director tried to make a modern version of this game, but failed. At the beginning of the film, the plantation owner Prosper comes into conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio puts his brother on a trip and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper can escape and escape with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi River. For over twelve years, he has lived in isolation on this island until a lucky chance allows him to avenge his brother .... If Prosper gets lucky, you have to find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this movie is really a bad attempt to create a modern version of William Shakespeare's original game. The story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters. Prosper does not have the same forces as in the storm ..... PART I PART
