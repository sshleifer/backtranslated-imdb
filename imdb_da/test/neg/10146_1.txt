In my opinion of this movie, the whole video of this movie was absolutely garbage bin !!!! But the soundtrack that was used contained the music in a large heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as a band called Firstryke, and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written !! and I'm curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it if I remember back so far, I would appreciate the feed again, I am collecting old movies and obscure movie soundtracks. It is a very time-consuming hobby, but it is very rewarding. I have seen this music music sold in Germany online for about fifty dollars a day. Album. Not too bad Hugh?
