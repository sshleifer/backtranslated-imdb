I would definitely not see this again, or recommend it to anyone but die-hard Shore fans. Adam Sandler took Pauley's shtick and went much further with it. <br /> <br /> The following is an excerpt of the IMDb title page here under "biography" and it explains why I'm not the only one who was abhorred by this movie. <br /> <br /> "... but his lunacy was dismissed as raw, stupid, and mostly unfunny.
