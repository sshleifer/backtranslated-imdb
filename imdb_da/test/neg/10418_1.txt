I sit here writing this review and the movie is not even yet. In fact, I just checked and there are 45 minutes to go. But whatever, there is no need to see it through to the end. I just want to write this review and laugh as the movie plays in the background and stumbles on to some kind of awful horrible conclusion that I'm not interested in seeing or knowing. <br /> <br /> What is my hostility to this movie? The signs are not credible. The reason is not credible. The pretentiousness of the movie is sick. Basically, all the elements of the movie are calling fake. Of course, Buscemi believed that he had something to add to the dozens of films that have already explored the well-themed themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life. But Buscemi was very wrong because this movie doesn't contain anything new. It is trying very hard to be depressing, but fortunately, no one can really be depressed by it, because it is obvious that there are no people around the world. What is depressing, however, is the knowledge that somehow this movie was voted for several undeserved prices. Disgusting!!!! Bottom line: Stay away from this worthless movie at all costs.
