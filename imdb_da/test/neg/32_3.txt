This movie seems well made and more needs to be done to promote movies from women. This site is also deeply disturbing because it justifies the manipulative and psychotic processing of a character that is deeply disturbed. If you have seen an advertising material, you may think it is an exciting movie about a relationship that has reached the end, but none of it suggests how truly disturbing the key premise is: <br /> <br / > A woman threatens suicide unless she soon becomes ex-agrees to relive here the most valuable memories of their relationship. When told how unfair (at least) such a threat is, Tessa (the alleged protagonist) suggests that "life is not fair." <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This character also uses tears to manipulate his former lover to stay and commit him to sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) constantly assures him "this is not sex." <br /> <br /> Conversely, the sexes have the leading games played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green, and this could air in the long run of Lifetime with a title like "Hostage to Obsession." There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would include Tessa's behavior in this movie. Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a boundary line psychotic, manipulative ex to a T, perhaps too good because there is no well-adjusted person, man or woman who could see this and not have tremors running up the spine.
