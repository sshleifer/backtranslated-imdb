I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I get into intellectual romantic movies. This movie just didn't move me. I felt it was about an hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and downcast. If you like tragedies, you like that. I just thought it was too long, which meant that it had many unnecessary scenes, which eventually led to about an hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, see the Titanic.
