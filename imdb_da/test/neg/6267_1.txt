I usually finish every movie or book I start even though they are poor just because I hate giving up on them. It was so badly made, I was in disbelief. I'm not just looking for Spielberg magic - I rent foreign films, and I rent really old sci-fi's (most recently Soylent Green - worth the rent). I like both Hollywood action and slower moving character development. Different movies have to be contacted differently than to appreciate. I couldn't find any redeeming element for this one ... The action was so wood, I was not least on the edge. Character development was largely absent - you are not left to apologize for anyone, or even identify with them. Finally, there were so many pieces that just didn't fill up. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - better to see paint dry ...
