Personally, I have no problem with the play or the script. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply terrible. Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> A first impulse is the role of laughing when you see it. What were they thinking about? The budget is condemned. The monster bird was an eerie joke. Of course, in my opinion, if the producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, they would have the special effect that people come up with a much better animal. Oh good. What is done is done. This will be the case with the eternal joke on those who were inadvertent.
