Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is an instructor of gory horror films that begin to feel the effect of having filmed for many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he loses his marble; This turns out to be a bad idea as the shrink is actually a crazy killer who is responsible for a shadow of grisly killing. Using the ability to make Fulci his fall, the loopy nut doctor hypnotizes the horror case to believe he is responsible for the latest series of murders. On the surface, cat in the brain appears to be a great gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci. Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment, ax attack and various other bloody killings, the movie probably wasted even the most hardened gorehounds. But when you look closer, it turns out that many of the cruel scenes are lifted from previous films (mostly Fulci's own "masterpieces"); remove these from the equation, and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted, some welcome nudity and terrible performances by Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as the psycho-shrink. <br /> <br /> As film evolves, it evolves into an incomprehensible mess, with the "borrowed" doing footage inserted randomly, without attempting to work it convincingly into history. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's Murder Secret, you've already seen the best pieces of cat in the brain before. <br /> <br /> After much blood sealing, the film wraps up quite quickly, leaving the viewer feeling confused and somewhat cheated. Watch the movie if you're Fulci completist, but I'd suggest finding out the movies from which the good bits were taken.
