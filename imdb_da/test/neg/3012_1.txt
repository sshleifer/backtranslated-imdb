This show is pathetic. I can't even imagine how anyone with an IQ larger than a can that is past their expiration date can voluntarily sit through this garbage for a full half hour. It is one of those rare shows that is so insanely horrible in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent just from seeing it. I conducted a survey and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points every fifteen seconds they see this show. It's only for another Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and pretty much a tie with Girls Will Be Girls. VIP keys owe every one of us an apology. When I see this travesty of a show, I feel sad for society. How can it continue?
