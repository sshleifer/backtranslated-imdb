As in so many films from the past, you would think Hollywood would learn it now, make it a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying ransom. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie will remind you of these basic facts if it ever happens to one of us. Why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really walk through the forest without being lost? Just an opportunity for a sentimental dialogue that was meaningless in the end. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to some of the director's comments in the special feature section, from the major features Redford made earlier, (Sneakers for one) surprised that he agreed to star in such a movie. The director's comments and reasons were weak. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie were the scenery, can't wait for spring to come.
