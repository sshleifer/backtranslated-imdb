Love the Andersen sweepstakes as a child and recently saw some exciting documentaries about this strange but brilliant writer, I was eager to see this made-for-TV movie. Unfortunately, the experience was nothing more than a disappointment that left me in anger and confusion. First and foremost, the story / script is filled with inaccuracies and accurate fantasies, and thus you create almost a whole new story while abusing Andersen's adventures, presumably for selling crap to suckers like me. Secondly, the beautiful boy actor (really ... ever a picture of the real Andersen?) Manages Kieran Brew to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant but very disturbed character he actually was. Though annoying and annoying like Andersen, Brew lacks the required charisma to create feelings of compassion what ever. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (who was actually supposed to be Henriette, Edvard Collin's wife) ... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a basis for a great movie! <br /> <br /> I could continue to be a very long list but feel safer just to recommend you all to spend your time and money on something else instead.
