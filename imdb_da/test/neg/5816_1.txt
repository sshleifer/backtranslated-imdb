If you're looking for a movie with beautiful images of Mount Everest, then enjoy this movie. Just jump on to the mountains. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) But if you, like me, think life is valuable and not to be wasted, this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 Sherpas and a member of the Japanese party, just because a man could try to ski down Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The issue has been raised in the film about whether the continuation of the expedition meets his personal goals was still worth cost in life and he responds an emphatic "yes". <br /> <br /> The part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. He goes for a short time, so the rest of the way falls until he comes to a stop in the snow.
