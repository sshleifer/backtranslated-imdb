Paul Mazursky fails on this movie. The printer, the direction, the casting and the play (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are all out of the mark. I remember the reviews from 20+ years ago being mediocre, but I thought it might still be worthwhile to see. With notes like Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who takes over in most of her scenes) and John Cassavetes, I understandably expected much more. The music chosen for the movie is crushed, the cuts between New York and Greece are confusing, and the overall pace leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to update this story or add his touch to it is marvelous - this tale of Prospero and his daughter takes very little of the game's imports and adds little more. However, the game is not one of Shakespeare's best, and it doesn't seem to be a good decision to make it even longer. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this movie.
