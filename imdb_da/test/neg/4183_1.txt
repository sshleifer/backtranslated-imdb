This thing. Oh god, this thing. I can't even call it a movie. a movie is something that does something. go somewhere. have some view of a plot or something. I don't know how to do it. I really don't. First, I say that dark fields are the worst movie ever. And I thought it was. then the pirate of the ghost island showed me wrong. And now, the third time in a row, another movie goes beyond the duty to prove me wrong. <br /> <br /> (sigh) OK. Dark Harvest II: The Maize. lord it is terrible. Let me break it down for you. People feel that daughters are in danger through some magical psychic forces he has gotten from his Act II popcorn apparently and ran to find them on a grain field. Of course, this is the hardest grain in the whole existence, as the size of the cornfields is from Jeepers Creepers, Corn of Corn and Signs combined. The protagonist whose name is Shy (awesome name btw) then runs through a cornfield ... finds some ghost girls, speaks to them, and ... runs through a cornfield. dig for a while ... and run through a corn field. and the incredibly sad thing? I really do not leave anything. It's pretty much the whole movie. The only thing I can't do is how he is being chased by two police officers who want to arrest him ... I don't know. pretends to be an actor. I didn't care about this point. He comes away and the police are - by the way - of the killer offscreen. holy treasure is there a killer? Apparently yes there is as he introduced almost 4/5 in the movie. But wait! Then he runs away for a while, and you've guessed it more that runs through the cornfields and graves. Then there is the end where he saves his daughters. Huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is it's boring. It is INCREDIBLE, INHUMAN, TREMENDOUSLY boring. I can't explain how horrible boring this thing is. Nothing happens, the signs are as appealing as a root canal, and it is only an hour and a half of nothing. The only good thing that came out of this movie was that I and my friend might have found enlightenment because of the nearby nirvana condition that this movie put us in after the effects of drugs in our brain had to kick over to overdo it. to keep us alive. Under the feeling of madness I found hugging a wall much more fun, and my friend found a new passion to laugh hysterically while he was flying all over the floor as if he were having a fit. It is the kind of insanity this movie brings. It's not just bad. It is bad for your health. The cover looks great with a picture of an AWESOME scarecrow, which I would even consider to dress like a horror con, but it was the most deceptive box ever. Don't let it fall you too! DO NOT see this movie. see a better corn film. Any movie about corn is better. just don't let it get you! does not! a 0 out of 10
