As the other comments say, it may be surprising for those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen delicacies, there's nothing new to this movie. I thought Delicacies were great when it came out, but this movie just comes too late to be without interest. I don't think it's a worse movie than Delicacies, but it's a tough one to see now, as it would probably be to see Delicacies again. There really is no point in the movie, nothing that really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant resemblance to Kusturica's movies, but he's really in another league so you'd better watch his movies than waste your time on Tuvalu.
