OK .. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating. My guess is that only the movie staff voted. So I'm here to bring justice to everything. <br /> <br /> Never has a movie provoked the public's intelligence more than this. Given, I laughed a little loudly - but the movie / story would definitely not have me. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad movies. A LOT. But one, one blows them all together. <br /> <br /> Speaking '96 computers, ridiculous plays and wheelchair chases - and we have young Tarantinos who can't get their ideas funded. Yup, life is a cruel joke.
