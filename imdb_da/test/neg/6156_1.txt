The above quote says everything for "Slipstream". I should have bailed out this movie after the first half hour, but decided that I should be fair and give it a try. I don't want to see it again, so if anyone with temerity to do that can come back to me with the number of clich√©s in the movie, I'm sure it will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some otherwise fine and talented actors were mingled with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character has hijacked Hamill's prisoner, an android who takes his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Bags (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracker so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question, however, is that he did not just fire the unit at Byron, thus sparing the middle man. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the scene after the unbridled scene with dull characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then you assume 'Here's something of interest. But you can't convince me that the movie makes sense at every level. Scenes of a futuristic stone age provide space for high community nobberries, but the highlight of bad taste is reached when Paxton's character appears after an evening dress with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks there is any hidden meaning here, you really stretch. <br /> <br /> Patient waiting for the frame proclaiming "The End" to appear, unfortunately it was even denied. If beauty is in the eyes of the guards, then it is also understanding; this movie had neither. Still, there was a single redemption feature when the final credits began their run - a fantastic view of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the film was keeping them floating.
