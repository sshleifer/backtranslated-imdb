At first, I didn't disturb The Grudge. The previews on that movie didn't make me jump, didn't scare me, and didn't tell me. But when a group of friends asked me to go see The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious about how this movie would be. I went mostly because of my friends. Not even 5 minutes in this movie I realized I was throwing away $ 7.50. The action from the get-go is horrible. The school girls in the beginning look like they have never acted throughout their lives. Then the movie plot takes over. Let me tell you, I couldn't stop laughing this whole movie. It's just so stupid. I'm pretty sure they didn't try to make it scary. They don't do anything jumping out or anything. It shows the children, then shows them "attacking". It builds on that, it's not an "all-of-a-sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the movie, the core film, the play is still terrible. It leaves so much time between the dialogue so that someone can add in their own comments. This movie is honestly one of the funniest horror movies I've ever seen. Badly written, horrible acting, horrible script, horrible "incapable of acting" and a terrible concept. The movie black out and changes situations several times than you can count. Each part eventually plays out and binds at the end of the movie. I would never pay again to watch this movie. I wouldn't even watch it on cable, for free. This movie is a joke. Please do not waste your money on this movie !!
