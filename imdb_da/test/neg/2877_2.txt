The basic plot of 'Marigold' boasts a romantic comedy where the film industry is held as a backdrop. An American actor Marigold, played by Ali Carter, is stuck in India. Worse, she's out of money. She then decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical so she can make enough money to get back to her nation. Here she meets Indian choreographer Prem, who is played by Salman Khan. Basically, the movie fails at the script level. Just by calling a movie, a Hollywood venture does not guarantee a quality cinema. Marigold stands out as the best example. The art direction is weak and outdated. Musically, Marigold turns out to be a dud. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loys is far from being recognized as a decent hear. In return, Salman lives out of his most amateur performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has a huge screen presence. Performance is also good.
