Okay, I'm 26, so I've been through all of the action heroes 80's hype, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the boys were my childhood heroes, they fought the wicked, shot dozens of bullets from a round only;) I watched the commercial for this movie on TV a few days ago - Chuck Norris threw some fireballs from his fingers. WHOA! "It's a must-see crappy movie!" I said. And that was it. Only very much worse. It's very hard to see the whole movie - filled with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters that serve Satan, the whole idea of ​​a plot in some forgotten societies that represent the whole of humanity - it's a lot of Christian fundamentalist's wet dreams. I have nothing against Christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste. It lacks almost everything that connects with common sense. Let's chuck Norris play an angels whose job is to look for the small town where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so smoothly straight and boring, not to mention its stupidity (yes it is not stupidity anymore, we speak silly as ... as a retarded child's joke) makes absolutely horrible movies, made as far as I assume for older people very devoted to the Catholic Church, because young viewers are laughing at almost every scene. Technically, it's wrong, for example, worse than those you've seen in the early 90s in TV shows, the plot seems very stupid, actors can easily be exchanged for cardboard stands, and don't mention the music that, as far as I am concerned, has heard was played on a childrens toy piano. I've seen a lot of movies, even the worst (those from the IMDb bottom list) like 'Space Mutiny' or 'Manos - the hands of fate' BUT don't believe me comparing to this ridiculous, horrible, horribly acted quasi movie that brings some students prank film for my heart rather than regular production. Avoid it. Avoid it at all costs. There is even nothing to laugh at. Chuck Norris has officially completed her film career.
