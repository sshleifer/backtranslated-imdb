Riggs and Murtough are back, but the magic of the first movie is disintegrated. The story is just awful! I really believe South African diplomats are smuggling the mythical Krugerrands into the United States. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely immense! Can no one get an African South African accent right? Or will we ever hear the British or Americans make them sound like drunk Dutch people? The only guy who got the Dutch accent was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie I didn't like was when Danny Glover so effortlessly describes an African accent as a shitty! I mean what a pat on the face of the African. There is also enough hypocrisy in this movie to make me vomit. I believe Mel Gibson's character is as such against the diplomats, but then sleeps with their P.A. type! Don't waste your time watching this rubbish, unexamined movie. If you want to watch a movie that does not completely offend a cultural group, then rent Die Hard 2.
