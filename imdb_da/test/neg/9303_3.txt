The book is amazing. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is incredibly impatient and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be so bad. The actors walk around and seem very flashy. Apart from law (and even guilty of some flashy actions), all the actors here are almost amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving your arms or hair around should not be regarded as acting. Damon is mistaken. He is far too stiff for a character to be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable, and Hoffman plays yet another slender slim character. Talk about typecasting. What is truly unforgiving about the manuscript (written by the overrated director) is that it completely rejects all shared details from the book and comes up with many of its own, and none of them work! The addition of jazz music is completely wrong! I assume that Minghella's idea of ​​Italy in the late 50's is the early 60's overcast with pictures of Chet Baker roaming the Italian landscape and spreading amore. Yep, Minghella is a true visionary. The film is so bleeding obvious. The stupid scene when Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. Very ridiculous. Yes, we get points !!! Every point or detail comes over a mile away, so much so that the film can give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. For example, we know that the Blanchett sign introduced at the beginning of the movie returns later only complicates things. And the soundtrack is sometimes completely inappropriate. Whimsical when it shouldn't be. The film continues for too long and in all kinds of meaningless directions. There are too many boring characters that fill the landscape (many not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! Minghella's son apparently showed his father that the Ripley short story was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to lead it as a benefit of sorts to his son. Now the director has achieved what he set to do: Talented Mr. Ripley, with his Hitchcock ambitions, is a movie made strictly for 12-year-olds!
