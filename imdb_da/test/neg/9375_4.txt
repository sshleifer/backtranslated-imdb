Initially, I must admit that I have never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately, the Dominee has not made me change. It shares some common mistakes, such as having a plot that is too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /> <br /> But worse, the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage actors in a game. Unfortunately, it is also common in many Dutch films and at least for me it makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the protagonists. The actor who plays Adri (I'm sorry, I forgot his name at the moment) at least delivers a decent performance and is one of the reasons I didn't even consider this movie any worse. Another reason is that at least it seems to have had a budget and production seems professional. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the fact that the play is often too articulated may not be so much of a problem if you do not speak Dutch, although I have already warned you that the action is not spectacular either. but that at least it can make it an acceptable movie to watch.
