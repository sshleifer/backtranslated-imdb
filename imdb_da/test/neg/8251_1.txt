I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this. When I watched this movie, a couple of viewers sobbed beside me when you "had to" sob - or at least feel "touched". Like when Hunt said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role name) tells Hunt repeatedly "It's not your fault" (Oh Lord, just thinking about that scene gives me goose bumps). I couldn't care less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob to Hollywood-made characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!) ... but it just made me a little bit and want to get out of the theater. I suppose I simply refuse to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by all of this. People are not me degrading ... these signs are, and for no reason, because they are unreal. Even worse is nothing new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all clich√©. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 out of 10. That's probably not that bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but so many went to the other extreme and gave it a 10, so I figured a single vote would not hurt.
