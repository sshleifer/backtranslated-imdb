This movie is probably a real letdown unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made. The Marxes were chosen to be thrown into the movie version of a game that was not originally written to them. They are kind of power-mounted in the rollers. Ironically, it could have been more fun if it had used different actors who did not have such high expectations for them. Instead, it has become obsolete as part of a cannon that it really doesn't deserve to belong to.
