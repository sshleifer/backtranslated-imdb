Mr. Brento asks himself if this movie was produced by the same one who produced the Dragonball Z TV series. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is an action movie from Hong Kong based on the first episodes of the Japanese original cartoon (which was also based on a cartoon series). And I really don't know if it was produced under the Dragonball creators license ... <br /> <br /> But the story of the monkey with special forces is an ancient tale known throughout Asia (in Japan is the name of the boy in history Songoku, in China, it is Sunwukong, in Korea it is Sonogong, etc.) and the story of Dragonball has a lot to do with that story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (which were followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the American version had another air order) . And all the scenes related to sexuality were also included in the original cartoon phases (without so much overactive and so much insistence on it!), But because of your comments I can assume they were completely removed in the American dubbing. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I agree with you in the movie over-take and how badly this adaptation of the original cartoon is. But maybe because of that no one can forget it after seeing it ...
