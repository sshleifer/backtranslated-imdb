This movie was so bad, I don't know where to start, apparently the filmmakers didn't. It starts with a guy in the mid thirties until the end of the eighties on television. The news tells of a maze maze that is open for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God knowing what and rushes off saving his children going into a cornfield maze and somehow being linked to this "vision" How do you ask? I do not know, and as I said before, the filmmakers also do not. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did he get these "visions"? It is never explained, we just have to follow it. He enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he is looking for go right past him, once they actually run into him. What is he doing? Is he hunting for them? No. He stands there as an idiot calling them when they just drove by. Do the girls stop? No. They run off and ask, "Was that father?" Then someone who dressed as a demon adheres to the "star" (father's character) he strikes him into a pathetic struggle to find out that he is a worker at the haunted maze. The police are called, and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad concept to use), they bowed him. They dress his hands in front of him so he can find something to pick the lock with as he does. First of all, by anyone who has ever been arrested, the police cuff your hands behind your back, and secondly, why does this "average guy" know how to choose the lock on handcuffs? Now he finally gets away from the police, who gives up and leaves a "star's" wife putting the siren in the police car out as a distraction. By the way, it is now night and all the workers who run the maze seem to have left when the sun goes down. Leaving a man attacking one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. Considering it was a slow night, these are their only customers, why not. Besides the police, apparently, there are also better things to do. By the way, the "star" who goes by the name "Walker" we find out that it is his last name, a name where his wife himself calls him by. Somehow he knows something is buried in the middle of this corn market and is starting to dig. I say 'somehow' because I couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. He finds a lock, what does it mean? Nothing for anyone who sees this, but for him it is a kind of clue about a crime. Someone killed their children in his "vision", and I think that's what he's doing, true detective work. And now he knows there's a killer loose in the maze's maze, one he somehow knew was from the beginning of the movie, why he's looking for his girls. Whenever we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a strange robot sound like a sci-fi rejection that alters a person's voice to sound mechanical. Why do we hear this sound? Is it at least related to ... something? Again, who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The top of all the bad plays and bad dialogue was when "Walker" shouts out "Hey you, Mr. Bad Man ... I'm going to get you." Another time his wife is attacked by "Bad Man" at the entrance to the maze maze, which, as mentioned before, is strangely empty of any employees or policemen. "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his mobile phone to tell him he is planning to kill his wife and children and him as well. "Walker" can only respond with "Hey. HEY!" before you release the phone and run off. With no one on the other end talking to, the killer kills his phone as well, pulling the wife a few feet and leaving her alone for the rest of the movie and losing the first opportunity to hold onto his treats. If this script was not written by a child, I would be surprised. Up there it wasn't. It was written, directed and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he also did so much of the crappy camera work, where we get random shots of feet going through the muddy labyrinth and meaningless shot of the corn field, wasting 90% of the movie time. Finally, the "Walker" cuffs for the cuff use the "Bad Man", which also seems to know how to choose lock with the same metal object that "Walker" had picked it with. Apparently, there are lots of small metal objects that are only around this grain field. But after the killer insists he will still kill the kids "Walker" kills "Bad Man" and everything is right with the world again. Now, in fact, this "Walker" makes a killer, killing a man who "apparently" murdered his own daughters and tried to kill him. He knows it, not because of evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a body, no one else knows that this guy himself was in the maze. And the lock? He gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls. No evidence. So he kills a man without any concrete reason. I can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking about this one. It must have been a way to cover an abuse of funds for the production company. I'd rather see the Blair Witch Project five times than watching this movie again. The actors must be ashamed. The director / producer / author / cameraman should also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If anyone is associated with this movie, please reply. What did you think?
