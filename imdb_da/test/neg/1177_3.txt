With a captivating title as the butcher in Plainfield, this Ed Gein variation and Kane Hodder will undoubtedly fly him off the shelves for a couple of weeks. Most viewers will be bored silly with this latest benefit on Ed Gien's life. /> <br /> The film focuses on Ed's rampage and gives us (few) glimpses in his Psycosis and lives in Plainfeild. These are the scenes that give the film a much needed scream. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is the constant focus on other characters that live and focus less on Eds.Big errors here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice to play Gein, but he does well and deserves more acting credits than he gets these days.Prascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also appear. <br /> <br /> 3/10
