I recently watched this movie because I'm a great Kinski fan. But, oh my god. Don't make me wrong. I love this guy. But in this movie, his entire play is simply a refusal to work! But fortunately he is not the only one to blame. First of all, the complete story is quite weak, dealing with a firefighter looking for a murderer, while Kinski is stuck in prison for a crime he did not commit. That's all. All dialogues and signs are so bad that it makes you scream. But maybe it's all fun. If you know Kinski-Biography, it's obvious that Kinski didn't even care about these movies. Especially all his Italian-western roles. He just took the money and that was it. Again, this whole movie is quite strange. Only for hardcore fans of the genre.
