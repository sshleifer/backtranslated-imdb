I didn't like watching DS9 compared to other Star Treks even Enterprise, but I didn't like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea from the Babylon 5 creator, but they chose not to sue for a reason I do not know or care for but to see as a Star Trek series is based on another Nerdies show is just too much for the bar, now I want to condemn anyone who even mentions DS9 when talking about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in that order. Before I didn't understand why everyone thinks the DS9 is amazing, and I didn't, but I know. It's also because the captain has a real angry problem and I hate people who seem cool, but freak out outside where; and he seems to be on every episode.
