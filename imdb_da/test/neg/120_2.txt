It actually hurts me to say that, but this movie was horrible at all levels. The blame is not entirely with Van Damme, as you can see, he tried his best, but let's see, he's almost fifty, how much more can you ask him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together undisputed 2; possibly the best (western) martial arts movie this year, created this. Everything from the plot to the dialogue, to editing, to the overall play, was just terribly complex and in many cases quite boring and indecent. Scott Adkins, who is fighting scenes seemed more like a demo reel, was also terribly underutilized and not even the biggest villain who is such a shame because 1) he is more than capable of playing that role and 2) the real The biggest villain was not only intimidating at all, but also quite annoying. Again, don't blame Van Damme. I will always be a fan but avoid this.
