No one in this movie has much to do. This is probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever used to watch a movie. The makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but that is the only thing that keeps this from being an a. The doctor's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds, and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene . The director gathered many of the right ingredients for a gallon, but somehow forgot about the skeleton of a story to hang on. Unless you know someone in the cast or the crew, I would not recommend even sampling it.
