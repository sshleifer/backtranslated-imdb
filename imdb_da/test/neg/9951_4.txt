Not to be confused with 1943 George Zucco's movie "The Mad Ghoul", "The Mad Monster" is a movie that Zucco appeared in the year before. In this fair-paint-by-numbers affair, Zucco completes a way to turn his bad craftsman, Petro, into a wolf / male hybrid using the wolf's blood injections and wasting so little time to send the transformed doofus to kill earlier colleagues who had scoffed at their experiments. It is a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays man / wolf here, will soon gain greater fame by playing the Franky monster in films such as "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The make-up work on him here is pretty boring, and it only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth (as in 1957's "Teenage Monster"). The sets of this film are also rather non-existent, and the decommissioning is abrupt and convincing. I have given the film a very generous 4 stars, partly because I have a loving love for the 1940's horror film, but truth to tell, most objective viewers would probably believe it is ridiculously peeled, and I suppose. It is certainly no suitable Universal affair or Val Lewton masterpiece, that's for sure! Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in the undemanding piffle like this. If you can save 72 minutes of your life, you assume you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (not too much worse of course!). Oh ... another thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video and you know what it means: fuzzy pictures, miserable sound (yes, the worst sound of any Alpha Video DVD I've experienced so far) and no extra features. You've been warned!
