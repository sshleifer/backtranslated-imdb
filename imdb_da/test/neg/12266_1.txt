within approx. 5 minutes into the movie was the first battle scene I saw that I could just help but point to the lack of excitement in the scene, where the cameras crossed back and forth really shows that he had no idea what he was doing, yes in fact, the soundtrack shows the best. I'm not a low-budget movie, and you're not going to get top 40 songs, but at least you get music that goes with the scene, which is actually not so harsh, well, if I saw something, I'd like to let you know . the script was so badly written would now surprise me a bit of the guy who instructed, wrote this beep, i will give the person a 10/10 and that was for the dvd cover because if i actually saw "before you see this" in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it, why well if you look at the front deck this actually well made you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards. now it is a very misleading thing, because even in a small film festival I would never believe in my life that it would win everything I can say is "wow if that was the best thing I would not know what shit in the film festival was like "<br /> <br /> movies that are so bad, have only good use and it is for an aspiring film producer to use as inspirational film like this, better tools, so good movies, because with good movie you almost know from bats there is a good chance that you will not make a movie so good, but if you use a movie like this, you can look at all the things that the instructors or writers did wrong, so you will not make the same mistakes and you have the extra plus to look at this movie and say if a beep like this can get done then there is hope for someone out there
