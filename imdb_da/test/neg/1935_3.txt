I saw it when it came out in theaters back in 1996. I remember I was already familiar with Elijah Wood's work (it was right, he did things before "Lord of the Rings"!) And the merchandising ties to the movie were beautifully abundant ( The "flipper" water cannons were even circulating). Adults were reminded of the old movie and television shows and for nostalgia their children watched what was tense because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was not what anyone had expected and flopped seriously. You know a movie in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and some dolphins scare the shark away and the baby - instead of getting out of the water in a boat - floats in the water for five minutes thanks his dolphin to save him ... apparently he has not taken into account that the shark is still out there, perhaps even under him. Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crusty and tired of reusing his Croc Dundee shtick. Today, no one even remembered "Crocodile Dundee" much less Hogan, and I waited half for him to suddenly begin to pretend he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the fish outside the water / social-satire laughs. All in all, it is a really bad "family" movie that is amateurish and almost difficult to see at times. I hated it when I saw it in theaters back in '96, and I hate it more now.
