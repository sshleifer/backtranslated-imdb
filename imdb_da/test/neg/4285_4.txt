4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> A somewhat incredible story with some haunted type "shock" that really doesn't fit. Gary Oldham's performance is very irregular ... not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency. His character does not behave in a uniform way. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / thought-provoking, sometimes violent / loud / almost wild. It's just not credible. <br /> <br /> Have many 80s movies dated badly? Will they be more comfortable 20 years from now? <br /> <br />
