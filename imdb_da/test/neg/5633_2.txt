This movie should have seen when it was pitched at the development stage and getting a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board must have tense the money men. All I can say is that they clearly had nothing on that week. Jacobi camps it the way that only Jacobi can do, and I thought he seemed more of the actor, whom he parodyed in his cameo role in Frasier a few years back. Vinnie Jones isn't exactly bad, he's just obviously out of his depth as a leading man. He is really very gracious all the way through, and if this was a pilot for a television series, it might just have been downloaded. But the scipt and camera work was terrible. Clearly, why this "jounalist" and a Measuring press officer ever would work together is never explained. It certainly could not have been because of the sexual chemistry that none of them exist. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-fetched plot that you can pass as original, but everything is just as constructed that the two stories just don't make sense. It was like two stories confusingly edited to one just to do two hours. Go see some paint dry for a few hours. Your life will be more fulfilled than seeing this nonsense
