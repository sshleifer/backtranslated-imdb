Down in the movie gallery I saw a glimpse I had to see. It looked like a fun low budget scare / action / western that I could get into. Yes, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway and hoped to laugh. Only a few laughs had to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who may be the weakest protagonist in the film's history. He looks like he could go on Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue also sucks. Anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. You could tell they were trying to do this anymore by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3-5 minutes to reload or see some zombies. At least, zombies look cool. So, some people are being shot, some zombies are dying, and eventually everyone died except our protagonist, who should have been dead in the beginning when he was shot down by four people.
