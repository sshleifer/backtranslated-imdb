Chuck Jones' 'Odor-capable Kitty' is the comic book that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world? kind of. There are a few important differences between Pepe, we know and love (or hate, for some people) and the character of this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat that Pepe pursues amorously in 'Odor-able Kitty' is obviously male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry in the cartoon's climax, his French accent falling away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the main character here, the focus favors the assaulted cat who pamperes herself as a skunk to scare her enemies. Mostly, the big line follows almost the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon, but Pepes aggressive courtship lacks the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him so great in character. He is also not as beautiful as he would be and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, 'Smell stand Kitty' is a pretty ugly and clumsy looking cartoon around. Its main appeal comes from its concept, which was original at this stage, before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed the 'Odor-able Kitty' of any effect and to the modern viewers, it just resembles a rather boring Pepe Le Pew card with a strange surprise. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, I appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu√© humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. 'Smell-Kitty' makes me feel like a child again!
