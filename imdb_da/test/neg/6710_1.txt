The authors know nothing about the Russian prisons, the film is totally cockamamie, has nothing in common with reality. They also do not mean that foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison, so foreigners never live with Russian criminals. The uniforms in this movie look as if they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia also do not work outside the prison. Every killing in the Russian prison is under investigation so the prisoners only kill each other if there are some very important reasons. Playing football is also prohibited in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very limited, no chance of bloody fighting, etc. Etc. So this movie has nothing in common with reality.
