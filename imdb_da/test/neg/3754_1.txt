Complete Enlightenment: I was born in 1967. Initially, I was tickling - after all, if you were a teenager who grew up in the Reagan age, a trip down memory path was worth a step or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'em Sock' em Robots? Loved them, not * despite * they were greasy, but * because * they were fat and stupid and funny. But when VH1 decided to make the series "I Love Last Tuesday", I knew enough was enough. Go Hal Sparks has nothing better to do than to read from a teleprompter how slinky's idiotic is? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no. No, it looks like he doesn't.) Snarky, snotty uber hips have their place, but already!
