I must start by saying that I have something of a love relationship with musicals. Some of them are amazing, some are even crap. So I expected the hair to fall into one of these categories. However, it did not fall in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the "Sodomy" song made me smile a lot and everything is pretty dated look. But the movie didn't take me in as others have, such as Rocky Horror. Although it's a bad example when I hated Rocky Horror for years, then suddenly I got it and loved it ever since. Maybe hair will be the same. Although I doubt it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror due to language and nudity content, so I doubt I get the chance to make it grow on me. Gettit? Hair .... grow ... Oh suit yourself. <br /> <br /> Somehow I didn't see the last fifteen minutes or so because of a technical error, which was a shame as I wanted to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here. <br /> <br /> Not a movie for the casual movie-goer, but definitely one for musical lovers. I really hope they do not restart it as I think such a re-creation would end up with a shallow, pale, PC version of the original. Worth looking for lovers of the genre.
