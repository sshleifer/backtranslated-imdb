Perhaps if I just laugh along the way, my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Maybe I'm too serious about this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm biased to the A&E version. I find it hard to imagine Mr. Darcy, portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth. The people seemed low and often dialogue forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so clear in the book. Her desire for Wickham was overplayed and then her sudden suffering for Darcy was not credible. <br /> <br /> Darcy was shown tolerably well, I want to give him. He managed to maintain the necessary demands, but I felt that he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that made his character so lovely, especially in the scene of the proposal. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs Bennet was also played well, but seemed lacking in many ways. The average mood of Bennet was not completely caught in her performance. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins' was a good portrayal. Much in line with the book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine, except to say that she may be the worst depiction in the whole movie. Other problems I saw were the few freedoms they took with the order of events that Darcy attended at the first meeting with Lady C. and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not come with Lizzy on her visit to Collins. <br /> <br /> The choreography was terrible during dance scenes. The scene where Lizzy and Darcy dance lose much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward to the ballroom floor. At least, this BBC version broke out the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when he praised the two for their dance as they performed very ill themselves. <br /> <br /> There were occasional moments that kept me interested, but overall, I find this version a disappointment. I would not advise this movie unless you are like me and you are excessively derived from such bad things. <br /> <br />
