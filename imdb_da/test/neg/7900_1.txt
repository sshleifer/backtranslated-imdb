This movie was just awful. How could anyone like this movie, and for those who liked it because of the jokes, they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the racial stereotypes, it was just awful. It has never had its moments if it pays homage to the 1980s, "Airplane!", It has to pay more. Awful play, horrible manuscript, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning, but people could have seen it all at the thought of the plane going down. One of the worst movies ever, stay away.
