It seems that many people really enjoy this movie and it is wonderful. It is certainly a very well-meaning film, and I appreciate it in an era of heartless or emotionally damaging movies. Unfortunately, the film has many problems and it was not something I enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> The primary problem is writing. It's just not that fun. When something tries to be snappy or witty and fails, it is far worse than when it has not tried to devote at all. This film is largely a series of "snappy" -but-gentle come-backs between adult family members, none of which seem imaginative or appropriate. There are also a few key rooms in the film that seem too much of a coincidence or character motivation to be credible or real work. Some of the back story seemed more exciting and served to decorate the story around the edges quite well, but it could not be the instantaneous flatness that permeated almost the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The management / editing also does not support the film, even though I am not explaining how precise it is. Somehow, it always seemed to me a bit false and that the actors mostly forced it through unnatural material. They tried and I didn't fault anyone here. There were also too many small and charmless roles in it outside the immediate family. Not a good rental in my opinion, but again, apparently a number of people found it very charming (I'm 38; I suppose maybe people over 60 might enjoy this movie more?).
