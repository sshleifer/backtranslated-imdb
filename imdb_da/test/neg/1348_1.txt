I was very disappointed with this movie. Ms. English, who says she's a fan of the original movie, seemed to have taken a big piece of art work and turned it into a flat-lined "ho-hum" you've come a long way in baby production. I tried to like Meg Ryan Mary Haines, but she was just boring. She did not feel anything about her husband's affair. There was no emotional battle, no deep injury. In the original film from 1939, Norma Shearsers felt Mary Haines betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The production in 2008 was more about some fake sisterhood theme, (In fact, my wife's words) and didn't make you throw a tear or even chuckle. The only performances that were worthy of us are Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more of Bette.) There really was no main character in this movie. The Sylvia Fowler character had too many sub-themes for it. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The restoration of the department store meets with Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. Pacing was also slow. Of course, the 1939 version had to be updated, but one was not. The reason why the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" issues. A subject by the way that is not obsolete. The magic of the original movie was that the film was about both sexes while you never saw the men.
