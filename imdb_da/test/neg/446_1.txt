Unfortunate and unnecessary successor to a bona fide classic. An American werewolf in London was undoubtedly a gem of a movie: humorous, demented, with just a touch of romance and so much, very British it made me stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended. Then came this abomination. You know you are in real trouble when the leaders are so utterly inappropriate that you are happy when slaughtered and actually begin to cheer for lycanthropes. Tell you the truth, people, I only got halfway through this CGIed travesty before I lost the will to live and turn it off. Absolutely pitiful and a wasted waste of everyone's time.
