What (beep) is going wrong with Disney the last year? Are there ideas for good ideas? Where's the magic? Where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good ... Okay, I know Walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. But is it a reason to turn out countless of the cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroy the ideas of Walt Disney? I never rent or buy a Disney sequel from which movie though. Because I had read a lot about its (lack of) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return" was broadcast today on TV in Germany, so I see it. It confirmed my doubts about successors. It was quite boring. Error animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous multiplane camera with CGI, mediocre music and a patchwork of various simple stories. It definitely doesn't look like Disney! Not like Disney I know! It looks like one of the countless, inexpensive and simple animation series such as "DragonballZ", "Beyblade", etc., broadcast daily on television for children. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after showing this crap was to load "Bambi" into my DVD player to see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again to see Disney on its climax again for to see the amazing art of handmade animation again. "Bambi" was the first (and until today the only) movie that I give 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit ... It only deserved 3 out of 10!
