It's a shame that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to undermine miserable stories and scripts just for the money. But hey, it's a cruel world ... This is just another of a large number of assassin thrillers who use all the usual narrative angles to try to make it look more appealing than it is. Sure, it has some good places, it's a flat production, there's some good camera work and editing, and it's pretty good pace in general. <br /> <br /> So what's the real problem? Simply the whole premise is just incredible. But instead of pampering a rotten story for you, I'll let you know what it's all about, that is, if you can get through it. I managed, but only because I like Baldwin and I hoped it would get better. <br /> <br /> It didn't. And it had one of the most anti-climactic endings I have seen for a long time. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it's harmless fun, I think, if you have nothing better to do.
