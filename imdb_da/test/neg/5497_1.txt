A movie, this stupid should never see the light of day. The play is paralyzed, the violence is just everywhere, the insidious end is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> It's about a lawyer who saw a murder done by R.I.C.O.O. squad. No one has never seen him, not even the affected men themselves. So he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. squad before they find them. <br /> <br /> Then the film goes on to a romance, gun shooting and voodoo. Now how in hell did voodoo get into this. Never watch this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me!!!!!!!!
