Typically Steven Seagal fare: that's what it's bad. The reason is dependent on a number of incredible unlikely coincidences; there is a large dose of conspiracy theory that would be much more palatable if we did not know that Seagal is taking it all literally; And once again, the bad movie millionaires tell Seagal all of us about The Rich's evil. <br /> <br /> As usual, Seagal's survival depends on Bad Guys never burning their arms beyond the reach of the arm and always wanting to give a little "I'll kill you" talk before blowing a man's head. <br /> <br /> Watch it right after the worse * Fire Down Below * and note how the Keenen Ivory Wayan's carpet apartment is more flammable than a large gasoline powder. <br /> <br /> Oh, and look at the last battle scene for the incredible missing bangs, which is probably the most entertaining thing in movies.
