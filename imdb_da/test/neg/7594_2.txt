New Year's Day. The day after consuming a couple for many vodka martinis and cosmopolitan mingled with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable company offers free digital special channels free of charge in January. We had a choice - do we use the freebie channels or do we begin to see the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas? We opted for the digital freebie when the DVDs go nowhere and we need something like ten twelve hours to see all the X files starting to end. The Drive-In channel features a horror-classic three-film marathon: Asylum (1972), The Damned House (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum has been reviewed here, and the pot and pendulum were too late for us to see, which meant that we could really only be really critical of the condemned. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie as the stars have reasonably good actors - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's Overwritten Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who could act even if she has a 10-year-old boy. Unfortunately, we soon disintegrated to giggle under the influence of a small dog dog, when we all shouted the names of movies, from which this dog borrowed his scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! The actor, especially of Evig's real daughter, was not so bad considering the stupid script they had to work with. CGI, for 1996, was fun - at its worst point in the last scene, as it should have been the most horrible, it was so bad, my wife and I were dissolved in laughter. Overall: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
