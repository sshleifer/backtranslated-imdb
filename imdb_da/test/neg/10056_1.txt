Filmed in Arizona by a mostly alien crew member, "Nightkill" is one of the wisest crimes I have ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) recently recently widowed Jaclyn Smith and hoped to find out if she had a hand in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... seems like someone probably bought into the American myth that all Westerners speak and dress like descendants of John Wayne! Manuscripts by Joan Andre and John Case may have worked better if you approached parody; this mysterious thriller just plays tame, with director Ted Post asleep on the controls. Don't be drawn by the video box art that Jaclyn screams while taking a bath. She actually takes a shower in this movie, but it's not revealing (nor does it make the creepy plot a iota). No stars from ****
