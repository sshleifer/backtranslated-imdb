I have to look this way all the way to see if there are any redeemable qualities to justify it in my customers' video libraries. Don't see this, not even a minute of it, unless someone has a gun in their heads. You will, as I did, groan and moan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, would turn and shoot you dead. Although you're the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, it's not worth even seeing the two or three short scenes where she looks. <br /> <br /> I will kick the asses of the shabby marketers who put Sandra's big picture on the front of this DVD box and have them thrown into prison to tear me or something. I really wish I had the opportunity to read a review of this movie before I bought it. <br /> <br /> Please call me and I will pay you $ 10 to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it sucks up the whole place! (just kidding - please don't call)
