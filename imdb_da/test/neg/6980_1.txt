I only gave this movie a chance because it had very good reviews. After watching the trailer I thought - what an unfunny movie full of clich√©s. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often do not portray the film very well. What a waste of time ... The movie is worse than the trailer, and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't remember a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but it is also quite a pass. I couldn't relate to any of the characters or hope they will be together because I found them quite stupid. The reason is extremely predictable and unconditional. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel mentally that way.
