I've never seen a B-movie like this ... on the page that the nanny Sofia gets killed ... a hand on a woman on the tape that handles the stick ... how bad is that? LOL, I grinned seriously and wanted to stop watching the movie, but I was watching to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... it's bad for itself ... poor Pinocchio .. the only one lovely bits are The first time you see some special effects of Pinocchio's face movement ... except it is the whole movie awful ... it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to save! But if you have nothing to do ... continue ... spoil yourself with some "Z" movies cos B movies are still too good for this ... LOL
