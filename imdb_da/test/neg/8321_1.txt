Are we serious ??? I mean wow ... just wow. I think I saw this flick in an old issue of the War Journal. This is pathetic, the originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea, what we receive, is a gentle restoration of an old plot line and "changing it up" we only change the gender or race of the original character it is moronic and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it ... but i think it's just a rant and will most likely fall on deaf ears to be confused by the sound of another turd hitting the toilet water as the best western since 3:10 to Yuma ... (wait for it) ... 3:10 to Yuma! Thanks to Hollywood for killing movies as an art form and turning it into a commercial bar of neo-pop junk and blatant retardation ... wonderful !!!
