Oh the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often, I think, do you ever show good movies? OK you've given me the big 'Heroes' and the reasonably good 'The Lost Room', but they are series, and as far as the film is good, there really is nothing positive to say. Poor acting, poor conducting, terrible characters and a low story, and it's just for starters. I checked the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find anything of interest to his resume (I am actually half-thinking that this is a pseudo name). The premises for four motorcycle bikes out motto cross in a national park when one of them has an accident that requires a park ranger to come rescue them only to get caught in a forest fire is weak and predictable that you know every blow before it happens. The leading man Bryan Genesse park ranger is so bad it is terrible. Cast as action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others make this guy Seagal and Van Damme like De Nero. The support supports are a little better, and well before the end, there was one left with the hope that the fire would soak up the whole cabinet. Avoid at all costs
