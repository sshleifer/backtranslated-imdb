THE OTHER is a supposed "horror" movie made in the 1970s. It's not to be confused with the same titles the OTHERS, starring Nicole Kidman. The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers learns her twin children's zones, which are simply referred to as "the game". One of these twin boys - Niles - must be "good". The other - the Netherlands - must be evil. The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept, and the film is adapted from a novel. I can only hope that the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The performance of this movie is much like a television movie by the kind of British residents who can watch Channel 5. In fact, this movie looks like it was made for the daytime movies of this TV -channel. A small trim for one or two scenes, and this would be a U-rated movie of that kind of Disney produce. But even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than afraid of the other. <br /> <br /> You don't have to check the director's resume to realize screams aren't his forte. <br /> <br /> Mr Mulligan relies heavily on the characters to drive the story. This is obvious from the get-go. I have not seen any of his other films, but KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a highly acclaimed crime film on this site. Unfortunately in ANDEN, the characters are given too little to do, and the plodding script ensures that the film never really goes the way one might expect. The direction is as bland as you might find. Almost every scene takes place during the day! Think about this - a scene shot in the open countryside of rural America by day, with the camera focused on the vast area. Does it sound scary or atmospheric? Trust me, it's not. It comes across as something more akin to an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes, both the aforementioned television series and the other were shot in California. <br /> <br /> There is a noticeable absence of danger or evil that makes the whole exercise seem meaningless. <br /> <br /> The ending was clearly meant to be very disruptive and perhaps influenced another movie from that time period. I don't want to reveal which movie, but I'll give 2 tracks - a young boy was the protagonist and the movie is well known. And I would add that the concept was used for much greater effect in the latter film. The action is actually pretty good and is the only reason why I have awarded 2 stars. The actors who play the twin boys with the actress playing grandmother are all trying hard on the bad material they get. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur is completely wasted in a rambling role as the mother of the twin boys. Don't be fooled by her huge billing on the cast list. She gets very little screen time, and her presence just comes across as a gag to put into her long established television career to help attract television viewers. <br /> <br /> I noticed the blur on the back of the DVD cover (in the UK Region 2 version). Comparisons were made to the EXORCIST, which I thought was a complete insult to the movie. There is no comparison. The EXORCIST had everything that this film should contain, but not - excitement, excitement, heavy-in-kind humor, very disturbing content, great acting, excellent characterization and audience involvement. Ironically, the EXORCIST was made only a year later, but in terms of style and performance it seems like decades prior to the boring drama known as THE OTHER. The other comes across as a work that had been tame in the 1950s, let alone the 1970s! The 1970s were a great era for horror movies with classics like the EXORCISTEN, OMEN, Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, SALEM'S LOT to name just a few. For that reason, THE OTHER shows an even greater disappointment. <br /> <br /> If anyone finds the synopsis of THE OTHER interesting, they may read the book or do some more research on what the book was about. I will advise everyone to skip the movie.
