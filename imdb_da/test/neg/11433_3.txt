In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as impartial as possible. The point must reveal the truth. This means, in particular, having among the interviewed experts in the field and representatives of all sides. This movie is a mistake in this respect. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men out of the street" describing the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is not given any serious treatment at all. For most interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be contacted and asks general questions such as "what are you thinking about the wall?" - She does not approach random people near the wall and asks them how they have been directly affected by it. Outside of an interviewee, the Israeli general responsible for the construction of the wall, we have no "experts" on the subject to give us the wall context (eg, how and when the project started, whether it has been successful, which groups are there for and as against the project, etc.) outside of interviews, a very large part of the film consists of extended pictures of unintentional scenes, such as. wall and people coming out of a bus. These shots take too much time, in my opinion. It's nice to see how the wall looks, but the 20-30 minutes that start filming on the wall (and only the wall) are too big. Obviously, these images (accompanied by Arab music that give rise to grief) are included only to awaken the viewers' feelings of disgust for the wall.
