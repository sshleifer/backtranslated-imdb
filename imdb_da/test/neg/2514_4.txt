Having seen Carlo Lizzani's documentary about Luchino Visconti, I was bound to higher expectations before I saw this movie made three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me became unhappy ... I was facing a need for critical opinion, which I generally do not like to give because there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer. There are also no documentaries that will investigate a theme completely. But when I read the reviews already written on this title, I also felt confused. People do not know what to criticize. To be clear, I share this movie in two main sections that differ significantly: the former on Visconti before his instructor's career and the latter on the Visconti director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed, is clearly presented. His efforts in horse racing are mentioned as well as his relationship with his mother so much disturbed by his parents' divorce. We also get a very accurate idea of ​​where Luchino was brought up as a true counter of Milan: in wealth largely, with children's cabinets, cooks with access to everything, in SAND ARISTOCRACY. For example, his father's wonderful villa at Grazzano and other wonderful villas show it. Emphasis has also been placed on Visconti's crucial visit to Paris in the 1930s, where he met prominent people ("left wing") who later influenced his style and message in art. It clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist with the aristocratic upbringing (a contrast at first glance). <br /> <br /> But the part of his instructor's career that started with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE just before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. His film is not well discussed. Why? Because there are very few people who really have anything to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works at LA TERRA TREMA, and that's okay. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, such films as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked Ludwig's role, I didn't like his interviews. Moreover, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate in such a documentary. There are no significant works by Visconti as CONVERSATION PIECE, there are no interviews with prominent cast Burt Lancaster. There are also Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is a footage interview with Maria Callas that seems interesting, but it is only a little bit. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as an instructor, makes fun of it all rather than saying something really valuable. For example, he mentions the event how the Visconti is separated from him after many years of service. Therefore, I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find a strong point here is footage interviews with Visconti itself. As a result, we can get his own opinion about his works. For example, I greatly appreciate the words he says about death about it as a normal chapter in life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after stroke while playing LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I think it's better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this doc. Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious about it, and his god's anger usually became people's feelings and views in stone ... 4/10
