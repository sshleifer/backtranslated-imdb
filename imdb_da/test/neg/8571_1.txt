Review: Nunsploitation films. They have existed ever since. Some are thinking of the Mexican devil worshiping film Alucarda, the Demonts Night 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Can't blame anyone for trying to exploit a religious / sacred picture and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here comes the latest addition to the nunsploitation subgenre, which is simply called The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls living in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nuns who are particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls, acting in self-defense against the abusive nun, kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. Fast forward 18 years later, and the nun is back and looking for revenge from those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This movie was produced by Brian Yuzna's Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Do you need a reminder of the kind of movie this company turns out? Well, here's a little reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordon's Dagon. That is it. Oh no, wait, I think, they also produced the excellent Christian Bale vehicle The Machinist. But it is. So when I deliberately rented this movie, I knew I wouldn't see anything that was fun windy. Yet with all the mental preparation, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the only good things this movie is about is its smart look. The film has some good movie pictures. It doesn't look like a cheap horror movie. The movie's special effects were okay, with The Nun able to travel through water. Well, it was a picture that made it even for some cool moments that sometimes scratched in cheesy area, but sometimes was cool enough to see. I dug the scene with the nun throwing on people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly lethal feature, but it made it a cool visual. There is something going on here, but not much of it. A particular scene with an elevator death was cool, but unfortunately the movie hit its top with that scene. And it was only halfway through. Then nothing really fun happens, and the film stands out in an incredible drill party. <br /> <br /> The movie just popping up to The Nun now and then to give us a boo scare, she would kill anyone and then CUT! We come back to the signs that speak crap, go through the rooms, open the doors you get drilled. And I just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into it. People open doors and enter rooms. Boring! And when the characters speak, the terrible dialogue is spoken. In a particularly stupid scene, a character just out of the blue determines that the nun turns into flesh and blood when she is in the water, so that is their way of trying to kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they deepen all these plans to kill the nun in a water tank. Now, who gave that guy this information and why did the others take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but its scenes like what makes the movie look stupid. And another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this movie was that they used Spanish actors who have a very thick accent. When trying to speak English, it is very hard to figure out what the hell they are trying to say. Id prefer to get them called, so try to figure out what they say and get frustrated. The fact that this DVD does not have English subtitles does not matter either. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is a movie that has some slender images, fine sound effects, but a terribly horrible script. I guess it only shows that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with horrible characters and situations your audience can't connect with, then you still have a bad movie . That was the case with The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want real fun with evil nuns, hire some of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the producers of this movie, they should say say hail maries and light fifty lights for their saint choice to see if they will be forgiven for making this sinfully horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
