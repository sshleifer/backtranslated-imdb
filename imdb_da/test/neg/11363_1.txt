This should be the worst movie I've seen this year .. and I see a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown to you without action, no start or end of any scene. It's just random idiots with make-up screaming at some level .. "Special effects" (Spielberg would laugh his ass off) is horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though. I need admin, which I couldn't carry to see it to the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett kept for dear life by the engine body was too much for me. I'm sorry for my bad English .. I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I had to sign up just to comment on this movie because I just can't believe this is a movie released in 2007.
