If you've ever bought from Wal-Mart, you probably know about the $ 5 DVD tray sitting on the electronics department. Well, this is where I found this movie. However, I was fooled! You see, the cover of this DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even named its name as a "headliner". I picked it up and thought, "Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie. Much to my surprise, Mrs Bullock had a small role ..... very little role. She plays the girlfriend of the son of the CIA agent. Talk about supportive actress. She may not have more than 2 lines in the movie. Besides being fooled into being a Bullock flick, I looked past it and I continued to watch an "action-packed" movie. Negative! At one point, the effects on the camera were lost for special effects. You have to see it to laugh what is really terrible.
