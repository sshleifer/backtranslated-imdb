What a complete disappointment. Forget this immense movie and grab the TV show instead. What on earth did they make the US president relatively healthy? ALL politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (Peter Cook is good as the British PM). It lacks the original biting satire, instead of the "lowest common denominator" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm generous! Unfortunately, this is another example of a remake that completely misses the point of origin, the difference with one is that they were both written by the same people.
