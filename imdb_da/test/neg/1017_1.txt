Director Fabio Barreto got a strange Academy Nominea for his last film O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna Barreto made one of the worst movies in All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think of me how poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the movie they do it. There is not a manuscript, it is only a very long video clip with beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
