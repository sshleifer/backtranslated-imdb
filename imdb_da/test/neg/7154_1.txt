I was looking forward to this movie. I like road trip thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a good soundtrack. And I was especially interested in taking a film tour across Europe to see if I recognized my own travel points. However, from the first scene, this movie was not available. What did Guy do on the wrong side of the road? What could have blown up the habit that rolled gracefully on a low grass slope? If they are such bad drivers, why should they take a delivery job? And it's just the first scene! Not even bad enough to be campy or stupid. Just awful! Terrible! Terrible! A waste of time. Go on to something ... something else!
