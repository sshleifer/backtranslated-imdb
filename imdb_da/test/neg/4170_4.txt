Code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love and actually punishes you if you try to grow with the wrong person. Have and have-nots live in completely separate areas, the powers are, can remove your memories, etc. We've seen these things before, but it's OK - no movie is 100% original. This kind of premise is always fun to consider. Unfortunately, just imagine such a future more interesting than seeing Code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe there are comments on a dehumanized future, but it is still boring to see. It is fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the picture is good, but normally (combined with its "evocative" soundtrack) it looks like a gilt perfume advertisement. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of TV camera work that I find annoying. You know, two characters speak as the camera artificially "floats" on one side. Two seconds later, it floats on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep you alert. My friends liked this movie. If they tried to get me to see it again, I would probably not do it unless they agreed to pay me $ 50.
