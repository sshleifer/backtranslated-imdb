I suppose you could say that this movie has a potential potential but no more because boy did the filmmakers botch it. The reason is practically incomprehensible, pacings are blunt and the play is pathetic. And what the hell is a trade rat? Worst of all, however, this movie is climax is anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; Plus the title doesn't even work externally exactly. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the beautiful dark-haired woman ... well the blonde girl was also pretty, but she was annoying and not as handsome as the brunette. Anyhoo, as with many movies, this is one that is only seen on MST3K.
