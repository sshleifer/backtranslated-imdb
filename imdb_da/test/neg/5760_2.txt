this movie really SUCKS, SUCCESS VERY HARD, this movie should be in the bottom 100, but it's so bad that almost no one has seen it voting for her so many times that it must be at the same time of "Manos - Hands of Fate. "I should have him position 1 (terrible), but the reason I put him 2 was for Eva, the city girl, that besides some scenes of nudity, besides, I was thinking of voting for 3, but like those killed Eva, I returned to 2. it is that movies like this, they should not be funded by anyone, not even they went to fame or other productions to the actors main, big lie, yeah, the story of a mining ghost that killing for "Mansalva" and after they have ended their misdeeds, it reappears, because at the end they shot it very ugly. <br /> <br /> FINAL SCORE (VOTE): 2 (for the nudity and performance of the beautiful Eva)
