Normally I won't even see waste like this, but since role playing is a dear hobby for me, and so was the subject of the movie I did. There were garbage in many ways that I didn't know where to start. I'd rather sit through the marathon "Plan 9 from outer space" than see a second minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 did not have an agenda. How the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent the extremist agenda as fact is beyond me. It is a daunting time when a whole group of people can become invisibly trounced without defense and no real facts presented. I know this comment went more socially, but it couldn't be helped as this movie asked it. Imagine a pro-nazi movie being scrutinized on film value. Will not happen. As it is, the people who made this movie are faced with themselves and perhaps move into a communist enclave, where propaganda is accepted.
