As an avid fan of Christian films and someone trying to keep an eye on Christian filmmaking improvements, I was excited to have a chance to watch this movie. I was ready to see something that would make a new brand in quality film. I was left disappointed. The initial stage is excellent, although a little rip-off by Leon - The Professional in the angle shows it a great filmography in the early exits ... all of it was downhill. <br /> <br /> I was almost unable to sit through this, I was tempted several times just to shut it off. <br /> <br /> The play was surely truly unbelievably terrible. But then again, the heart of the problem was the actual manuscript. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur manuscript "The Awakening" (soon to be an independent film) resembled a Hitchcock thriller next to it. (It doesn't say much.) The bright side of this movie is that it was recorded on Sony's brand new High Definition 900 cameras shooting in 24P. This movie and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones were the first movies to ever use these new technology cameras that year. Unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with poor lighting, poor angles and awkward handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I found out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie movie should look for it. ; ) 4/10
