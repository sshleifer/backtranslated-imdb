Wow, I was really disappointed. I didn't really plan to watch this movie in the theater, and I want me to maintain that plan. It really should be a movie for television. I was very excited to see it as I am a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie did not do its justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the actor around. What a horrible cover of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no power to the movie, it was very difficult to get into it. One scene we get angry, hyped up, we want blood, the expectation rises, just as the director leads us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more comfortable to follow if it was broken up into three-section Sunday paper cartoon. <br /> <br /> There was also some logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. The gangster leaders were scrawny guys, not very trustworthy. Matt Dillon heads a mobster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was just no intimidation there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack .. wow. I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What horrible guitar solos, my god. The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is a positive comment I would like to make about the movie. The settings were nicely finished. I liked the colors, a good job that conveyed this time period.
