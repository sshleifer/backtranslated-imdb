An extremely fast paced, exciting, interesting, detailed rich book. It's a great shame that the film didn't have any of these qualities. Not only was Tom Hank's gentle mannered depiction or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key figures, great deviations from the original story line and poor Irish / Italian accent of Carmalengo. The game of Ewan Mcgregor, made for the worst book for movies As a big fan of the A&D book, I had great hopes for a more sumptuous, true-to-book detailed movie where it would start and end just as the book did - leaving me wanting for more. <br /> <br /> All the movie really did, was depressed within the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> What was impressive was how ... sorry! I couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing. In short - Vittoria was the token hottie, a very different to Audrey Tatou, and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard should insist on making another book for movies, I would be happy to save my Â£ 6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - much more entertaining and deeper more satisfying!
