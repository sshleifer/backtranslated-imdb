This cozy middle class sitcom was the subject of much hate by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s, like Ben Elton. Did it deserve such evil? Well, Terry and June were never wise, it was never a well-written story with different threads that cut at the end. It was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents looked at. They chuckled instead of laughing, but they were probably not offended by the show, so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterial. A foot in the grave was first and foremost because it seemed at first sight to be just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after Terry Scott's death, an episode on terrestrial television was broadcast and it has been his last trip. There have been few repetitions of the show on any TV channel. Fortunately, television comedy is advanced since Terry and June. It's hard to find good words for it - Terry Scott made the best of weak writings.
