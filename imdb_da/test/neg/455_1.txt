No surprise except in how fast ABC responded to the gloomy ratings. According to published reports (Variety), the show achieved the worst ratings in the history of ABC's television network. <br /> <br /> And I quote: ABC's music talent contest "The One" opened Tuesday night to cancel my reviews. <br /> <br /> The article continued to say that the show got a "shockingly low 1.1 rating / 3 share in adults 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers overall." <br /> <br /> It makes it the weakest premiere of any reality show on any network and also in every series storyline in ABC history. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw the advertisements for this, I knew it would fail. We don't need another American idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a fair chance of success.
