Combine good casting, poor writing, good orchestral scoring, poor dialogue and good history idea with lots of potential, but are never aware, then you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> Just bought the movie for a buck, it's worth it, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Good to see Mark Hamill act again. <br /> <br /> There should be a decent sequel to remedy the damage from the original. Or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place. <br /> <br /> Berstein's scoring gave your attention to the opening credits, but the long shots of sliding aircraft and the even longer disclosure of interesting plot points dampen his attention to gain points. <br /> <br /> Growing a movie like this is really easy, after all, the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a huge cast, but that's what it is. And it's not much. <br /> <br /> Favorite line - "We'll make it, hah ha! ... (BOOM!)"
