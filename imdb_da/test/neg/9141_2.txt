This is a mistake that is so complete that I get angry. <br /> <br /> All the features and structures of Reggio's early films are gone and leave nothing but a hash with digitally ornate images whose sole purpose seems to be whining About Bad Things People Just Do How Star Trek similar wormhole graphics, slo-mo colored seascapes, mutiplicities of overtly fake computer icons and shoots of athletic competition, which, incidentally, show that no one has ever been able to top (or even match) Leni Riefenstahl for film-forming bodies in progress, Edited along with an overlay of video colorization, which a 1980 producer "Dr. Who" would have rejected as "too cheesy", add up to a controversy against "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional, or visceral connection between these images as aggregated and mutated by Reggio and far too many digital effects artists, and the cautionary story I suppose he wanted to produce. With all the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have pulled their heads out of their own sense of saying something important and thought they might not all say something new. Only people who watch too much television could make such a movie and believe it to be meaningful; This is kindergarten Stan Brakhage, and ultimately gutless in his relentless openness. The only irony and excitement that is obvious here (as opposed to in "Koyaanisqatsi" where the relentless beauty and strangeness of time-shifted ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning) was when the DVD I looked and fixed on. This is MTV for the Noam Chomsky crowd, based on reflex rather than reflection and means nothing. Two stars for the music, which is in Glass's best Pomo-Cesar Franck style and has a passionate cello from Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope for his sake that he didn't have to record his parts for a play of the movie; there are some things you shouldn't do for a paycheck yourself.)
