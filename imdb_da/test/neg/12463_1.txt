I just wish I had the good sense to turn this movie off at the beginning when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to improve. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the movie. The film has nothing to do with the real world. The reason has nothing to do with a plot. The actor consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack but can't pull it off. The management is a girl trying to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, she can't pull it out either. They are in love even though God only knows why. And in the end, I hoped they would all kill each other so I could believe that none of these children would ever destroy the world again.
