What a terrible adjustment. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers play in a story set in the early 1800's ?????? The only sign that didn't bother me was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and I usually love Jane Austen's movies. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't really understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end, as they had no chemistry or indication at all that they used to each other. Isabella and her brother were far exaggerated; It was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys," and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that whoever you think is good is not. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
