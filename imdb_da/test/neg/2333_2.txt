ok we have a movie that some call one of the best movies ever .. but i sit here thinking about hell f!, storys sux {there is no story], the diolou is pretty clean, artistic nothing amazing! and the play is nothing right out, so if you want to be arty, you say you like it, but if you have a real view, you don't say or if you explained why!
