I ... I don't know where to start. Dragon Hunt can only be the worst movie in movie history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. Showgirls? No, it had kitsch value and was technically a well-made film. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then throws it up and feeds it to a homeless man. It's so much of a travesty. <br /> <br /> It is, if it can even be called, rough. It does not have the charm of impromptu plays so it has to be written, but it is recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. Several lines were delivered in a way that shows that the actors (or basically the people on the screen) either regretted being associated with this movie or thinking of a particularly humorous joke from Saturday Night Live that they had seen before. camera. I could write three more paragraphs about the quality of acting in this movie, but you and I both don't want to hear it. Makeup and special effects (as with most movies, the only good thing) was ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous I can't remember, has a Mohawk glued to the top of his head. Yes, glued to the head. And you can also say that it is glued on, if you look at the spot where it meets its pockmarked skull, you can see a plastic strip, not unlike them on false eyelashes. Fortunately, he is basically the only example of make-up no-nos in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is also some terrible character development, to put it lightly. The women, who are strangely handled by the supposedly benevolent bird brothers (and I think they are really pushed around), are not only ugly, but ... gasp ... they don't know what they're doing! In a scene, they turn on their apparent lovers, go along with the still ugly bad guy and then sniff a little coke. Apparently, they managed to get some really good cocaine because they started to shake and laugh even before it all got up in their nostrils. Great timing girls! Plus they carry some really awful things, clothes that belong only in the late 80s and early 90s. This movie, this movie, this wasteland I have to say is also a waste of time. If you see it, it will hurt you and it will require suspension of not only your faith but also of your whole brain. If you want to be stoned with your friends and have some good laughs, see if you can get this movie (you must download it safely) or you may not even think about it. Hope I was helpful.
