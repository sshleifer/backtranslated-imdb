So you have the warning warning --- but I would argue that you cannot spoil what is already rotten. I suppose they changed the name to "The Cavern" just if "WIthIn's reputation had preceded it." After paying the cable rental for this movie, I expected to save my household waste for a month and send it to the author / director. He had his waste delivered to my home, so I thought it was just fair that I return the favorite. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; maybe the author is a fan of the Ali G Show. But they should just have started inside the cave, because from outside obviously Kazakhstan. It was the first idea that I would hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has no redeeming qualities, save one: it is consistent. Everything is terrible. The writer, the director, the actor, the cinematography --- all aspects of this movie are just bad. And I like bad movies, goofy movies, B-horror movies. . . but it was just pretty bad. And stupid. And hackneyed. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To get a feel for the movie, go into your laundry room with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights. Insert a flashlight (on) into your dryer and start the tumbling. Now everyone starts screaming and shouting at the top of your lungs. That is it. <br /> <br /> For a complete re-enactment, 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room died on the floor. Throw karosirup on them. Turn on the light again (stop the dryer). Now a guy in a gorilla costume goes into the living room and rapes the last person standing. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: Read through the other comments many find it remarkably this movie was made on a low budget. It's not remarkable. Making a crap film on a big budget is remarkable (Waterworld). Making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, who I thoroughly enjoyed). Making a crap movie on a low budget is not surprising, and you can expect more of the same if those people still produce movies because I can't imagine anyone would give them a pile of cash after watching this. br /> <br /> Is the low budget an excuse for a horrible movie? No, and there is certainly no reason to see it. Do you want to eat a sandwich with dog food because it was cheap to make? <br /> <br /> The IMDb rating for this movie over time will be interesting to see. It must go further down, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can exceed the ability of the filmmakers to ask their personal friends to give it 10 stars.
