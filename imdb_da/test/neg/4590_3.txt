Give me a break. How can anyone say this is a "good hockey movie"? I know that movies tend to do a nice p *** - poor job of exhibiting hockey to the public. And yes, it was done back as the United States hadn't embraced our sport to the extent it has today but really. I have played hockey all my life and have seen even more, and it is my friends who are pure lunacy. The scenes on the ice were stupefyingly bizzare ... the special occurrence that I refer to is the "sword fight", I mean "the stick battle" at the end of the movie ... where everyone just stands around and not, not with fascination, that this actually happens, but in wondering who wins the duel between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie. Yes the story from the ice is a little better, I stress a little. <br /> <br /> I don't know, maybe there's no point in it ... I mean, let's look it up: the movie is right. Hockey is only a big blow on ice ... Oh yes with a small piece of vulcanized rubber jumping around - occasionally into what is loosely termed a "target". Youngblood is either shaky or hysterical, I can't figure out which ... maybe someone else will have good luck.
