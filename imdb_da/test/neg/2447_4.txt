Standard "Outbreaks of disease in remote area; Expert who happens to be on holiday in the area takes responsibility" movies. There are few deviations from the norm. One is that the children involved are fairly reasonable right from the start. Usually, they are monsters that repeatedly empty the works until they finally redeem themselves. Another is that the local medicine man / witch doctor, who is usually an obstacle early, never gets completely discounted or redeemed at the end. Perhaps as this seems to have been made for the faith-oriented PAX channel, they did not want to be too judgmental for the believers. Finally, there were no evil local politicians / leisure industry bigwigs trying to cover up the whole thing. The lack of these stereotypes was refreshing - if we have the PAX channel to thank for it, I might have to try a few of their offerings. Apart from that, however, it was fairly standard. You've seen it all before.
