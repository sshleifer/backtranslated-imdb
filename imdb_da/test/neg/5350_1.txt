This movie supports self-righteousness! It gives freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and finally got him free access! Despicably as this may be, there is also adultery in this movie. The Connaughey character has the heads of the Bullock character, and the film has some of these stereotypes of sample film (which the important news brought to justice in time) that makes any aesthetically demanding movie goer like me sick! I really can't believe anyone liked this junk. It's a movie that's so bad and stops fake ideals that I can't put my critic in a eloquently gratifying way. When will the American people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24/7 by movies like these that make the reality into some BS where there is justice for everyone if they only take it in their hands. This cowboy attitude only makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with America!
