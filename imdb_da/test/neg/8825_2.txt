Othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this movie. The bad portrayal of Shakespeare's characters and the horrible reproduction of the love Desi & John had made this movie into the horrible filth that it is. Othello, led by Jeffery Saks, is far beyond mediocre and horrible. <br /> <br /> The movie Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi. Their faithfulness to each other will be tested by the man's friend. In the film's opening scene, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable without faith. Moments later, Jens girlfriend comes out on the screen and scares the viewers and shows them instantly how much a liar and a powerful hungry person are. <br /> <br /> By far this movie was much more horrid than the Shakespeare short story itself. With that said, it has a small amount of good parts. For example, the love shown between John and Desi was depicted very well, and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable as it was explained in the book. Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi, as good as it should. <br /> <br /> Love, jealousy, fraud, this movie is based on all three main topics that were in the Shakespeare short story. However, the novel really explains how all this came together much better than the movie could. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. Much more detail is also included in the novel. That's why this movie is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it also find it disappointing. <br /> In conclusion, this film was by far the most horrible depiction of a novel ever exposed to humanity. By avoiding watching this movie, not only will the viewers save an hour two of their lives, but also save an eye or two from Ben Jago's palpable face popping on them.
