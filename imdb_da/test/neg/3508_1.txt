The movie's tagline is "You think you know who you are. You have no idea." I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the alleged suggestion that this movie tells me who people really are. If people in real life really are like this, then we are screwed. <br /> <br /> A bilingual movie I went in late and left too early. A movie that is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming The Race Film of All Time, so it welcomes the great tools a movie needs. <br /> <br /> Hollywood rules are like this: if you show something in the first half, it should be used in the second half. Thus, the gun the daughter cares about her father's purchase can somehow find his way into the story in the other half. Hollywood's rules are to create dialogue 'real' - a concept that changes with every decade. Is this 'real dialogue' somehow less ridiculous than the 'real dialogue' by Kevin Smith ten years ago? Hollywood rules say we are setting the stage and when action is rising, the camera moves closer to the faces - in this movie primarily so we can see the supposed shame of the character, humility and transcendental realism. The strings rise, the frame falls down, and our heart is supposed to break. <br /> <br /> This movie is as scary as it is vapid. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, in order to combat this prejudice, I will not say that this is a natural situation as a result of the location, but enough from the author and director. Author Paul Haggis already showed a taste for controversy over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film propagate the best of a script's ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera, it becomes obvious that he not only knows how to write true, natural human drama, but does not know how to photograph or lead it as well. Paul Haggis comes from the TV country, let's not forget: the country with diminished expectations. Everything is as obvious as a television movie, and it is simply presented to simple minds - Haggis exercises in us, over and over again that people on the surface may seem terrible, they have hidden secrets. This is a good idea, but so terribly presented that the whole assembly of bad / good has an amateur feel. Structurally, the film has broken up in the tradition of Magnolia and other previous films. Editing is as typical and conventional "cinematic" as it could be - if there is a dramatic movement such as. A doorway or a car that passes between the subject and the camera, the editors use the extreme motion to give the cut that creates a more kinetic quality. The problem is that, apart from the impetus for keeping things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is maintained. Not only are the puppets in this hideous race and judy show handled outrageously, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The movie desperately tries to present reality, but there is just no talent at all. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all the performances are muddied together, brought down by the film's low, low aesthetics. We have film technology that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. But not only is the cinematography inappropriate, but it is mindless camera work and framing that thinks it is actually inspired. The result is small stylistic blooms that one recognizes but does not add anything to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - as a father holds his dying child (the father can also be shot, I didn't hold myself to find out). The camera sees its face and gives us the famous Vertigo track / zoom. Vertigo shot !!! It was at this time that the movie became hysterical and I had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of hollow Hollywood 'art' filled with sound and rage, but nothing meaning (in Bernard's own words). I hate wasting so good Shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad.
