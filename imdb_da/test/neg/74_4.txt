Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent unfortunately cannot get any engaging ideas to cook in this artificial trifle about a colorless mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite her mother's fleeting behavior. Apart from several good sequences, I did not entirely buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she is too intrinsically smart and focused to be dismissed as this devil-maybe-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a bad form of the role of an irresponsible Parent. Natalie Portman fares much better than her child, and yet there is an eerie aloofness for her work (and some of her scenes, like the one she asks a boy to strip, are misunderstood and uncomfortable to see). Absolutely not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it is not a captivating movie, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****
