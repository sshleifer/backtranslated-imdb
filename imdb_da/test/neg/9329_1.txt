This film was childish in its writing and ridiculous in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin throws in his bed and his glimpse of a gimpy native is a sign of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no facts to the imagination and leaves no room for excitement. The lady doctor at one point says she believes the city will "explode soon" from all the crazy events. In fact, there was nothing in the movie to make this line relevant. From the horrible job the movie had done, I would never have known that there were tensions in the village. If you are in cheese film, go ahead and rent this, but if you want to see this done right, check out Exorcist: The Beginning
