One minute into UNTOLD and it's already ripped off by BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR techniques. Does that mean we see many trees? We will certainly. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder blow up things? Now, this movie has the budget for a TVM, so the answer is a resounding no. Can anyone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Good because there is a scene in this that looks like this type of show. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen falls to black under a TVM? Great because it happens between every scene in UNTOLD. In fact, it also happens during all stages. Did you enjoy MILLIONAIRE - A GREAT FRAUD? Great because one of the characters resembles a bearded Major Charles Ingram who competed in the competition, trying to scam the show out of a million pounds. Seriously one of the figures resembles Major Ingram. I kept expecting him to say, "It's worn, but it can be a big foot." Cough, cough, yes it is a bigfoot <Cough, it is definitely a bigfoot <Hoste> Yes I am going to shoot it. Final answer Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh and have I mentioned that all of the above are the good bits? <br /> <br /> UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen that recognition goes on for the night of DEMON, which I saw twenty years ago, and I think I have only seen less than a dozen movies worse in all that time, but it said UNTOLD is still a very bad movie In almost all aspects, especially editing, as some other reviewers have pointed out, whole pieces of the movie feel lacking while there are other bits where scenes are spliced ​​in the wrong order, this is a really bad movie that deserves far less than its rating of 5.1, I give it 3 out of 10 and I am very friendly
