Honestly to God, the summary says just about everything. The planet Andromina (not confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by a cheap L.A. strip club. There are no strippers so recent male visitors go out to recruit strippers. The men are confused with kings or arrested for spying on women (although in spite of being a female planet, we only get two women participating in any girls' sex scenes) and finally, as always, in science fiction cliche films everywhere , women are convinced that men are good at something. Well, not the men who made this movie, at least! <br /> <br /> But boy, can we see much of it, in strange amounts of softcore sex and nudity. This one has less plot so usual for such flicks, so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie and laugh your teeth if you are in this kind of thing.
