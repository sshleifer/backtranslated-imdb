Although I am a fan of Heather Thomas and I have some of her old bikini posters around here somewhere, I can honestly say that if the only movie I had ever seen her in was "Cyclone," I would never guess why she had done so as far as she was in show business. <p> <p> Directed by Fred Olen Ray (as good an omen as seeing the buzzard's circle over the head in the desert), this tale of a woman (Thomas) who is supposed to protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as "B" movie as it gets (or in Fred Olen's case, "B minus"). . It's not all movies that combine Thomas with the actors Calibs Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, make very few movies. And even though they seem to have fun, shouldn't any of the fun be passed on to the audience? I agree yes, they voted against. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you ever wanted to see Heather deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the "F" word and connect to the battery cables, I've probably been looking for that. I'm even happy with old "Fall Guy" rings. <br /> <br /> A star given in the hope that when another "Cyclone" hits the city, Heather runs out. I know I want to.
