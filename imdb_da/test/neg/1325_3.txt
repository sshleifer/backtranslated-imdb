I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of trite melodrama. It was too long and seemed at least mildly inconsistent (given, I didn't pay full attention ...). For a more entertaining depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At the Gates. True, some pretentious people will scoff because it is a Hollywood movie and do not show "the cruel reality of war" as this "wonderful foreign film" does, but it has better flow and is as fun to watch. In addition, there are already well-maintained "gritty" war films, and this one seemed just amateurish. But hey, you like it, so go straight ahead it just wasn't for me.
