It's a weird, strange movie and doesn't deserve a better brand than David Lynch's! The special effects are poorly made, the actors are basically bad actors, and in this movie it's not a race that is the minority of a planet and is trying to fight the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie that greets sect kinds of organizations. It's not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the sixth epic! Check out David Lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!
