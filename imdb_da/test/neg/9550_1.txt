SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A clich√©-riddled movie that somehow makes an anti-death with dignity statement, though it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic officer who has suffered and will die in the last four years (apparently he wrote his big sales book only a year ago, but not everyone has despaired). He arranges an assisted suicide with his doctor who returns in a week. Meanwhile, he helps with a serial killer. He recruits the gutsy, I don't want to, but I'm just so good at it, cop Jolie, and they track impossible clues to very unlikely conclusions in immediate situations. Hi, the old bolt means the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel at the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's ridiculous. But no one is enough to find out that the doctor who will help him is the killer. <br /> <br /> When he comes to Washington to murder him (ahead of schedule), he has a change of heart and struggles incredibly for his life. Cut to the mandatory evil guy to shoot the good guy scene when the BANG gun goes out --- but the bad guy didn't fire! No, the woman steps out of the corner, she just shot him in the back.
