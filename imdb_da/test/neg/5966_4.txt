I really liked this movie. Number 5, the star's robot of the movie is hit by lightning strikes, and something has happened to his circuit. He works and thinks more like a human being. The robot repeats commercials, he learns after watching television. He then uses these proverbs on his relationships. Number 5 is quickly witted and fun. The character mimics the voices of stars, trying to dance like John Travolta in Staying Alive and many other things. He has a saying for most of his relationships that he remembers. Robot's actions are really good. Number 5 wants to drive, cook and thank Stefany with all the characteristics of a human being. The way the robots move and protrude is really hysterical. I am disappointed that the authors could not keep it clean for all viewers. This movie has a surprise ending something you wouldn't expect. I hate movies that have sworn in them, even though I like them, I give them a lower rating. This movie had swearing words. Jesus Christ was used as a harsh word that offends me, it is used at least three times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been a wonderful movie without all this offensive language. There is no sex in this movie, any violence that robots blow up cars and machines.
