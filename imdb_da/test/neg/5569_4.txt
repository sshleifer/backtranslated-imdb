I really wanted to like this movie because it is refreshingly different from hordes of everyday horror movie clones, and I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers are trying for something original. Unfortunately, the plot did not coincide, and none of the characters were sympathetic enough to really care for them or their fates. Visually, The Toybox was pretty interesting. The director took a lot of dodgy moves, like adding in small bits of (flash-looking) animation into parts and really cheesing up some of the special effects (like the light of a particular amulet). Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but he deserves kudos for the experiment and the cinematography was generally of high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when the same approach of throwing lots of things on the wall to see which sticks were used on the plot, the results were not very good. The movie never really finds a tone that it likes, moving schizophrenically from black comedy to the family's soap opera to the 80's witch-flick to childhood nostalgia for slaughtered family slasher. Taken on its own, bits and pieces of each of these elements work quite well, but nothing always gathers to a satisfactory whole. Besides that, much of the plot is never really explained. I'm not someone who likes to have everything for me, and I like movies that leave things to the audience to decide, but the parts left out of The Toybox just seem to run out of money before they could explain them, or they did not really think about things at first. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the director's next project as I believe there is a lot of talent that lurks beneath the surface here, but I can't really recommend The Toybox on its own benefits.
