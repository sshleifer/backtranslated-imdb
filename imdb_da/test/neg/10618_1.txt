I chose this movie because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and I've always been a fan of foreign movies. But for anyone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, Hate this movie. While aiming to postpone the lives of young, subclass men in Lima and to the extent that it succeeds, the characters are hopelessly superficial, and the audience is having no feelings at all for them. Although the story is mostly about M, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is best, incredibly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: Some small spoilers *** <br/> <br /> Basically, the story of a young man named M who has been searching for jobs but without success (He get employment twice, but finish because they are "not for him" when you are poor is the last option you should have). Some time is spent with his friends whose idea of ​​"fun" is raping a little 14 years old, stealing crappy tires out of a piece of shit car for a dime weed bag and several other slightly retarded activities. <Br /> <br /> Ms friend comes up with a plan to make $ 25,000 a piece and move to the United States by driving Cocaine to Miami. When the boss gives them a job, we are treated to an extremely paralyzing scene by the three friends who buy clothes at the mall with a bit of music playing in the background. We see them try different clothes like little girls who get $ 200 to shop, get your hair cut and then stretch out like slick gangsters (a character, Carlos, from this point on sunglasses always ... even at night) . The day before they leave, the group's leader leaves to talk to the drug master and leaves M and his friend to be stupid. They catch up, take several samples of the drugs they suppose to run, and break into their old school, act as animals and strike everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when M tries to call his girlfriend hanging on him. The friends then continue to set the payphone on fire, bringing out a bunch of children and some old men with a gun. M and Carlos' friend responsible for the drug show up on his motorcycle and want them to leave with him now. Then he takes himself and is shot by the old man. The police discover and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who has shot the guy) and cover their dead friend with newspapers while music is playing and it falls to credits. <br /> <br /> **** Close Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even saw this movie another time and hoped to see some subtle, redeeming factors for it, but it did I not. A complete waste of 102 minutes. Although I have to give it credit for being straightforward and not shading away from disturbing elements, casting, acting and overall direction leave much, much, much to be desired. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a movie exploring the issues that it should take, hire the City of God instead (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this garbage at all costs! You have been warned !!
