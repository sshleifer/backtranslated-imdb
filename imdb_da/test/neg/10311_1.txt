The previous comments are the way to generous. This film is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a lot of fun giving friends to see and describe it in advance as "convinced!" "No words can express how I feel about this" "This movie will move you" As expected, friends took these unpleasant comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic joy I had of this on the people was worth the $ 5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, a (former) friend says that I owe him 90 minutes of his life back. I especially enjoyed the "gun's eye view" of parts of the movie. Really amazing in it's absurdity.
