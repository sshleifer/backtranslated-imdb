John Madden's cinematic interpretation of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome lacks in making justice a great literary piece. While the story is maintained, the elements that give the short story its soul are crooked and all in all lost in the movie. Madden fails to convey the innocence, and the general tragedy of Ethan and Mattie's relationship instead transforms it into a moral story. The mark is missing and the item is lost in added details and poor dialogue. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost entirely the antagonist, the books at least sympathetic characters, where in the film she can be almost pitied even though it is a stretch you feel bad for this sick woman being cheated on. The book describes more precisely Zeen's tyrannical control over the house and Ethan. The movie just dropped me off. The addition of the fox was meaningless, as was the scene with Mattie trying to kill himself. It was just poorly interpreted and done. Movie Errors: Ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with Denis Eady, addition of the love scene, fox scene, store scene, his plans allowed, lack of showing of Ethan's inner feelings and thoughts, priest's introduction instead of nameless engineer, much about Zeena by about the growing relationship in which in the novel's reader never knows what Zeena thinks or is aware of. Just too many mistakes and bad directions.
