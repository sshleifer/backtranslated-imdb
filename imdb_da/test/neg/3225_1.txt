What happened to Mathew Modine's career ??? I still remember when he was considered an A-actor ... <br /> was the cutthroat island the last stitch in the coffin of a once-promising career ??? wow, this guy must really hate Renny Harlin's maturation ... <br /> <br /> This movie wants a lot to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs, the characters are caricatures and badly drawn on it ... but What pains me the most is to see that Mr. Modine takes on this kind of roles besides actors so far away from his caliber, I think at the time when he made movies like BIRDIE he could never have had in his worst nightmare imagined he would in the future appear in movies with a hick humping a cow that just had her anus booklet, and perhaps even worst, beside Elizabeth Berkley !!!
