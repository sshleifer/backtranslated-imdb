I mean, come on! Now my countrymen have started making westerns! Isn't it enough that our cinema already sucks? Now you have to infect English-language films with Polish plays and no sense at all? Please stay away from this movie, do not throw your eyes on it. A 5 year old baby could make a movie that makes more sense. I'm from Poland, and I'm ashamed that this title can actually be seen by you. I kindly ask you, DO NOT watch this movie and if you do, DO NOT rate Polish people and Polish movies based on what you see there. We had some great movies in our history and we had some bad ones, but this one - it's like nothing worse I've seen in my life. Stay away!!!
