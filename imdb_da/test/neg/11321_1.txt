I like a good news song. No, I'll take it back. I love a good news song. I absolutely despise GGROBAR on the other hand and have from the first tone I've ever heard. When I found out that someone had made a comic book based on it, my head almost exploded. Now that I've seen it because my kids were asking me, I wish my head had exploded. It would have saved me from the creepy misery that was this cr @ pfest. First of all, it is a ridiculous idea to make an hour-long show based on a three-minute news song. Stretching a song like this, which had to pillow as crazy just to be so long into an entire hour, is even more ridiculous. This was poorly written, cheaply animated, badly acted ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, this is ever bad.
