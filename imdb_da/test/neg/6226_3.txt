This is a new approach to comedy. It is not fun. The ghost is that this in itself must be fun. The story is based on a French novel, located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The movie is also the same French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters work like in these Carry-On movies from years back. <br /> <br /> I think there are also jokes - throwing those actors who do no attempt to act French in any way, to get them to marry in the broad English dance hall comedy and leave the whole bloomin 'mystery inexplicable to the public. <br /> <br /> In the humor department, this is practically the Algonquin Round Table, isn? <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to be charming and quirky, and I think these features are kind of fun. Not as fun as Ducksuppe or Love and Death, maybe, but more fun than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin. It is an example of personal filmmaking. It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but remains true to its premise and its internal logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical within the film's own bizarre world. I like this kind of eccentric movie, but I found this to be fast-paced too slowly, to be boring, boring, and to give too pleasant pleasures or real humor. It's just a kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways and wasting some amazing talents along the way. It must be the low point of the career of each of the great stars, who are all otherwise distinguished players. I found it to be the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing. Then call it an interesting miss, and pass it on as a rental unless you really have much time to kill. <br /> <br />
