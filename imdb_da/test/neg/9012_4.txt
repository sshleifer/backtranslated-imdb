Which travesty of movie rankings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. People, this is much closer to a 3.0, I even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I've put it. Come on - how can you get a movie about a network of static electricity around the earth and alien amorphous cell structures, and not give it at least 4.0 for creativity? Then you have as much dialogue as "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I don't think they ever came back to that mud. It doesn't matter, it's the kind of flick that 'Z' movie diehards live for and I can now lie easily. In fact, I saw it a few years ago without the proper understanding of it, along with Corman titles such as "Attack of the Giant Leeches" and "The Wasp Woman". I don't know what the fascination might be, but quote a character from the movie - "Whatever it is, it works fast!" <br /> <br /> Back to the alien amorphous cell structure - I liked the idea of ​​a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells. When the astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) returned from the dead, I had visions of a scene that could have been a precursor to the "Alien" of 1979, but that was not the case. Instead, budget constraints limit the image to a remote Big Bird knockout, though that concept was still nearly a decade away. Who knows where an idea goes off and picks up another? <br /> <br /> See, this is not that bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Whenever you can join crash landing astronauts with alien creatures who are required to take over Earth, you have a winning combination. Throw in the cheesy monster factor and you're on your way. Just remember - "A wounded animal, the big one is not good".
