I had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 because of the horrible soundtrack. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a problem with me or the tape, because some actors and the soundtrack sounded good. However, most of the players' voices were distorted or disturbed outside recognition, especially for non-British. There are lots of cute little phrases that would make this an enjoyable movie - ending up in Bosnia by mistake is great - but a lot of humor was lost in the sound.
