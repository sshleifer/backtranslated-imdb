First of all just let me say this ... Ghost Story .... hi!?! If any of the other people who smashed this movie from the beginning to the end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that the characters disappeared when the protagonist returned to see should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a tip, and it is the biggest mistake made by the study marketing it. It was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story to confuse you as the protagonist is confused as you try to make sense of it. The problem in this is that they lost too many viewers; The ghosts appeared to "for human and real" without any of the usual speech characters, images or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to tell you that you now see a ghost ... and that's what they tried to do. The main character does not know that she sees ghosts or the viewer. Now you get it? As long as you understand that the protagonist sees ghosts, then you understand the movie and not become so annoyed by what is perceived as great surveillance in continuity or plot failure. <br /> <br /> I admit this being said, it was still not a good movie, just not that bad an almost everyone else made it to be. Just understand if you are planning to watch this movie, all you see is "not" always what you think it is. 4 out of 10 to shop, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor, although there were some grim and scary moments. Still not a good movie, just way misunderstood.
