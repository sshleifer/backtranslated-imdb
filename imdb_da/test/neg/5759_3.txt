My buddy and I chose to see this obvious piece of junk based solely on its tagline ?? After nearly 30 years of miserable and rudimentary teenagers, I can't believe that just now some nerdy horror brainiac come up with the brilliant witty slogan "The Axed for it"! Aside from that, "Miner's Massacre" is just as random, annoying and forgettable as anyone else out there. Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and features all the terribly stereotypical characters you want a horrible and painful death to. The gore effects are computer-made and thus banned and the mandatory "big" stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are completely wasted despite their biggest billing. Forte mines and abandoned ghost towns make an ideal horror setting ?? The creators of "My Bloody Valentine" have already found out in the early 80s? But his tedious films simply haven't got any innovative ideas or even far-reaching features to offer. Old greedy, twenty something losers who refer to themselves as friends, although they clearly cannot stand each other, detest an old mine in search of the gold that is supposedly hidden there. Of course, they inevitably revive the Zombi in this way, and he is only 150 years of rest to prepare for a massive teenage massage. Yay! The casting is unusually annoying in this. The girls all have impressive racks, but refuse to show anything. Instead, they all prefer endless whining and taking unnecessary risks. The dim-witted blocks obviously serve only as screen fillers. In her almost five minutes of playing, Karen Black still manages to make a very fool of herself by portraying the most prototype and hysterical local nut woman ever. The zombie has a stupid and very convincing face, but he looks okay and reasonably threatening when it appears in the moonlight's distant shadow as he swings around his pick-ax. Since the best thing about "Miner's Massacre" concerns the above tagline and you can read it on the box in the video store itself, there is very little else to recommend here. Director John Carl Buechler scored some modest hits during the eighties, especially the original "Troll" and a fair "Friday the 13th" successor, but it is of course time to retire now.
