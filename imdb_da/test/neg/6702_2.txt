I assume that the heart of the filmmakers was in the right place, but frankly, this movie is truly invincible. I was offended by the tone and the total cop out ended. You can't take problems like this so easily! Without knowing the film's last warning ... we see as a guy pistols down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and must follow him for the next 2+ hours as he tries to establish a new life ?? You cannot sympathize with a sign that does this. Can not! Not to mention, we get nothing until the last say 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, why this guy suffers so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - things that real veterinarians suffer from. All we know is that he has a pain in the ass wife and cannot economically take care of her and his 3 children. There really didn't seem to be any study whatsoever in what current Iraq veterinarians are going through. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie suffers from a heavy and utterly inappropriate score. It's a disaster. It's really damaging to some really good actresses of the male leader and sometimes Joe Morton. It shatters everything you need to feel, and sometimes you give the wrong tracks altogether! Again it was a brutal thing, this guy did, and then seeing him get a new job, meeting a new blonde, the fight behind the counter makes the toast not suitable! And really, the end? What a freakin cop out! How dare you. <br /> <br /> There are far richer movies dealing with war influence on returning soldiers, please do not like this one.
