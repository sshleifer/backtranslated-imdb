This film looks at the suffering a family experiences during the child's death and the healing that can finally come to them. <br /> <br /> The family learns about his son's death on Christmas Eve, 1991, destroying Christmas time for them. They do not celebrate it again for many years. There is an interesting comment from the daughter reminding my viewers to consider the needs of the surviving children in such a situation. Matthew's character refers to Jesus, but I suppose other comments he makes come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if other viewers would acknowledge these comments. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the data in this movie.
