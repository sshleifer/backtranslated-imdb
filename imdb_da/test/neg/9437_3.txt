This should be considered as one of the cheesiest TV shows for a long time. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did part justice and certainly looked at that part. But today it seems to me that Nemo was made to be more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's on the other side. <br /> <br /> His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was exaggeratedly brilliant by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his "Penguin" days from Batman. Although he does not "whine" his penguin here, he is without parallel as a maniacal professor. Only John Colicos, of Battlestar Galactica's fame, chewed better on stage as a maniacal despot. I can never remember what the wrath was between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been serious since Prof Never missed a chance to try to scoop Nemo and vice versa. The effects were nothing special, although Prof. Cunningham's submarine was far better than Nemo's. It also had a crew member of strange, fish-like amphibians who served Cunningham and made his only bid. <br /> <br /> But the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. Delta Beam! He always said "Four Delta Beam!" After which a fishy crewman would terribly override the movement of shooting the weapon using a full shoulder shrug. Really invaluable! They don't make them any more like this, and maybe just as well. But as other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have a loving, if cheddar, place in our hearts.
