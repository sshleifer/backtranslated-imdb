again such kind of zero budget digital video camera waste. and again I fell into this trap cuz the title had "zombie" in it (German title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) story: on halloween, some people visit "the dead museums", it's a trap, a crazy doctor will kill the people, all associated with some aztec cult. so they fight some zombies in there. <br /> <br /> Ultra-cheap scenes: some corridors with black tape on it. a few dilettant drawings and a few skulls that you can find in each fun shop. No actors, just low class models wake up with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. ridiculous makeup, your local hobby-make-up zombie fan will do better once it looked like they didn't have enough money for enough color, otherwise they just couldn't do it like this man they have to realize the look of their "zombies". some ridiculous martial arts struggles with the zombies, slow motion. Just when the instructor wants to be scary, he uses some standard digital video cam effects, where everything is fluttering. incredible! 0 out of 10!
