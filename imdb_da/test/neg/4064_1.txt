Perhaps this movie was actually supposed to be satire as 'Airplane', but it did not succeed so much since it failed to be a 'thriller'. I don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a few hundred dollars for little technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magical flight managed to morph from 757 to 767 to 747 for an hour, and the power bars were working backwards. And the dialogue sounds like it came out on the back of a child's 'phone' game, where everyone spoke different languages. I actually traveled the TIVO and sometimes saw it again to see if it was as bad as I thought first. It was.
