Derek Jarman has shown us over and over that the dialogue is not his strong suit. He is a painter and painter he does. His film is almost always visually beautiful, but equally exciting to see as a paint that is already dry. Watch his movie fast forward, the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the manuscript or characters using them as just a grid to hang a very long and well-constructed film frame. He even goes as far as contradicting Shakespeare's original script to achieve these unprocessed slow and lifeless scenes. There is none of the romantic, magical, trickery or urgent scriptures requiring a little spontaneity, and especially Caliban's character is reduced to a trembling and insane idiot of the kind, similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It's too bad that it's just about the only movie version of The Tempest.
