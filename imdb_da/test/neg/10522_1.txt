Even my five year old was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and exaggerated. This movie couldn't do anything about whether it was slapstick or wry commenting on the state of "pee -wee" sports. The signs were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> Don't like the referee's reference that slips the laxative to his teammate ... very mediocre fond of a child's movie. <br /> <br /> Typical "Mafia" behavior was boring and stereotyped. The dog was so funny though !!
