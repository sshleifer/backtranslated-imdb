The guy mentioned suing for the 1.5 hours wasted by his life, I can't disagree on one. The movie started out as a kind of class projector stuff, and ended up in a dark room. when the girls were completely naked, there was magical light everywhere, I know I didn't write the script or had anything to say about it. But this is like a bad remake copy of the saw with a bad end. Thinking of a man who actually wrote this story sick. This is really a shocking movie, can't say I'm wrong because it's not. It's just the brutality and the violence that made me sick. It is really frustrating to see a movie without end, it is like bang in your face. The movie is finished now you can go home. <br /> <br /> Cons-cam lighting (although I think should) overdone fuse <br /> <br /> Cons-real in your face-acting was in my opinion you in <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is NOT my taste of movie, witer wanted us to know that these things happened and the man wrote his own little imagination. Have you ever seen the movies? they all had a moment of comfort in it something to hold on to. do not do. Maybe it's just me, it's too soft, but this movie made me shake, and the story is really short, the sick man kills girls slowly. But the actors sucked you into this movie every blow every scream, you could almost feel it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, was I quick to judge about this, it's a horrible movie? No it is not. It is an exaggerated example of reality, this is a real thing it could get. But don't watch this movie if you expect a great mystery or a real plot or even a kind of story. Man gets girls in a dark room and kills them one by one, it really is.
