The film begins in Latvia right after WWI. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the proliferation of the Bolsheviks, and the troops were apparently there to protect the interests of their nation. But sometimes they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "white" win. The whites, however, were deeply fractionated - some wanted a ts back, some wanted a republic and some wanted something. Due to these mixed goals and the lack of a genuine commitment from the foreign armies, the entire expedition was sentenced and left the Soviet Union after only a year or two. But what I didn't know was that German troops were also involved. This surprised me when they had just lost WWI and were not in the best shape to be mounted on such an expedition. <br /> <br /> This is the background of the movie, but it is also about a pro-communist rich lady and her bad love for a childhood woman who is among the German troops. She throws herself at him repeatedly, but in each case he takes her back. Then she sublimates these desires in various matters. Although none of this gender is all the graphic, this and the underlying reason the man is not interested in is a rather adult movie and one I would not show to the younger audience. <br /> <br /> While the setting for this movie is interesting, the overall movie is as gray and lifeless as I've seen. I do not recommend it unless you are an incredible patient or you are really in overrated German movies. I especially warn anyone who suffers from depression, as it will undoubtedly make it worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German movies out there waiting to be seen - like MOST MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER COASTS GO TO HEAVEN, WINGS OF WISHING OR ALI, FEED THE SWEET (among others).
