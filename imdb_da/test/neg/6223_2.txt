Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut for the hunt. <br /> <br /> Forced frivolity. Miscast artists work hard to have fun, so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep gives it a good try. Pierce Brosnan just plain embarrassing. Inexplicably put on a Greek island Lots of scary, screaming women. Lots. <br /> <br /> There was a silly jukebox musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen box musical. If you like ABBA, half-heartedly. If not, an attack on the senses and an insult to what intelligence you are left with when you leave the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to watch this movie and went with some friends who did it but for God's love. Why is my sex screaming to convey joy? Ever sit next to a table with women who have had too much to drink and are determined to have a good night out on the town? That is the feeling of the whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped.
