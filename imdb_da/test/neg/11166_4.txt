Korea's answer to "I know what you did last summer" follows a similar story path to its American counterpart: A year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them up one by one. Who could have seen them that night - or were their "victims" still alive when they dumped him in the sea? <br /> <br /> Origin cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore, but efforts can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and frightening. RECORD also doesn't let out of badly rehashed scenes from "I Know ...", "The House on Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among many others) and fails to deliver a decent shock during the 95 minutes. <Br /> <br /> Acting is decent from the cast, which, as it seems, is the norm in Korean cinema, is approaching an uninspiring gusto script and an undeserved enthusiasm. However, the direction is at best mediocre; a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer costume * NEVER * contributes to RECORD's downfall. Most disappointing is the film's ending, where the two surprising terms are so obvious that you have previously rejected them as being too obvious! RECORD's only saving grace is its bright start - the first action is actually excellent and shows American colleagues how character development and mood tuning should be done - but it's a very bad movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
