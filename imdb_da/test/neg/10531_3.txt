Steven Segal has made some horrible movies, but that's one of the best when his career took a dive about ten years ago. The casting is better than normal, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, most of the scene scenes look good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in movie history. Someone is being executed because he stole some money? Some objects types kidnap a Supreme Court's justice? Your goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money? Meanwhile, the chamber is full of trap doors and fake floors and resembles a set from one of Cirque Du Soleil Circus Shows. <br /> <br /> There is the prison problem. Here is Warden a homie played by Tony Plana. The prisoners all have their flag colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a bunch of prisoners is fighting and looking up some guards while Warden looks. What's going on? The warden gives them a string talking to. He can punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are good for laughing. However, Nia Peeples looks good, and Ja Rule is trying to be an action hero. Lots of fun watching the prisoners all "do the right thing" and get armed so they can release the justice of the Supreme Court from her prisoners. No matter how bad Half Past Dead can be, keep in mind that it's the best movie Steven Segal has ever played in Under Siege in 1992.
