WHAT WAS HE THINGS?!?!?! How sad an actor as enormously talented as Michael Rapaport - who stole our hearts in "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town" - has sunk to this pathetic level. The script on this sitcom is the crust back on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. Shame on everyone involved. There is a tendency: large film actors who are no longer hot merchandise turn to television - often with disastrous results (reference stinkaroos at CBS and NBC, but ABC has a hit with "Boston Legal" - hip writing and great nostalgic use of Bill Shatner). To waste Michael Rapaport in this "All In The Family" rip-off is an insult to the viewers and mostly Michael himself.
