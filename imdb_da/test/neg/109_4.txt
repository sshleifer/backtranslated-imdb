Ben, (Rupert Grint), is a deeply unhappy youth, the son of his unhappy married parents. His father, (Nicholas Farrell), is a priest and his mother, (Laura Linney), is ... well, let's just say she's a hypocritical soldier in the army of Jesus. It is only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a creepy, eccentric, once famous and now forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that he finally finds himself in true 'Harold and Maude' fashion. Of course, Evie is deeply unhappy herself, and it is only when these two sad bags find each other that they can set aside their mutual misery and make their way to happiness. Of course, it is corny and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a hard side, and Walters who could sleep - go through this kind of thing if she wanted it, is excellent. It is when she puts the madness on one side and finds the pathos in the character (like hitting the bottle and throwing in the sink) that she is best for her. The problem is that she's the only interesting character in the movie (and it's not because of the script that doesn't make anyone any favors). Grin on the other hand is not just unhappy; He is also a bit of a drill while Linysy's stiff bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Still, she has English accent off pat). The best thing to say about it is that it is mildly comfortable - with the emphasis on the least.
