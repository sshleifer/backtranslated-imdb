As a serious horror fan, I understand that some marketing teams are used to selling movies, especially the really bad ones. So I wouldn't call it naiveé that I assumed this was softcore horror ripping off Cannibal / Zombi / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong, as this is very hardcore. I should have realized that when I saw the odd "No one actually or identifiable less was used" warning. Notice the identifiable part as if he were daring to catch him? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a penchant for coming to the beach, in search of a mutated resident who kills residents. Due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a presumably evacuated island, the radiation sent the last man to the rapist / killer. <br /> <br /> Author / actor George Eastman is the only one trying here and succeeding in keeping his clothes on. Sex scenes are out. Women walking around nude exude a strange conviction and even ask rape when her husband turns her down. Well, two chickens that beat each other will naturally become a lesbo scene because women are horndogs. I saw the chicken throw another chicken salad and finger myself. <br /> <br /> If there is anything you should know about this movie then it is. Because the rest of this crazy movie is the same. Oh, who am I doing fun? There is a ton more to tell here. Like the white "duchess" who pays for 2 black guys to tag her in a salon. Or the "Duchess" takes her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself. When he refuses her progress, she begins to cry. So he is the good gentleman he is, he reluctantly allows him to rejoice over the other crew members. I honestly waited for the pizza guy to show up and "duchess" to ask if there is any other way to pay him. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they leave for the island to do their research. Wait, I thought it was a zombie flick? But the zombie does not go to the 73min mark, but at that time everyone else has been "entered" masses. I found myself quickly hitting a few scenes ?? or more. This is my first splatter porn flick and I don't think it makes this subset any justice. I think it is the woman in me who speaks when I say I want more plot and less sweaty, dull, hair sex. Fun is that this could have acted as a decent horror movie, as the idea of ​​atomic bombing mutated a bitter man and killing his family was a good one. Even Eastman's character shakes his head and goes away from a couple of copulating. It makes me wonder if it was the character or the author himself who was being inhibited. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into the sound or movie quality because you should already have guessed it was bad. This production was shot back to back with 3 other films, including the Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which sport most of the same cast. Eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck. Nevermind, I want to talk about the sound suddenly. The sound was strange during the sex scenes, because while casting speaks Italian, it seems they are recording English voiceovers and playing it over their dialogue. So while 2 people reside, I can clearly hear someone in the background say "No! Yes! Wonderful! Wait!" There was a slightly entertaining Italian score that couldn't save this movie. SFX was at best minimal and consisted of some blood in just a few scenes. And I would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes when the bright warning label said on the DVD cover (ahem, another marketing trick), so no fear there. Just fear the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in Widescreen 1.85: 1 image format. I saw Region 1 Not rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. There is apparently an XXX version of Alfa Digital, which is the same time, so I doubt anything is different. Prices vary but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or as I would recommend, don't pay anything and pretend it doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: Shipmate, "Civilians are unlucky. Women are unfortunate. They are also scientists? They really must be monsters". DVD Extras: Original trailer with hardcore shots and kills to make it more interesting than it is, Trailers for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle, & ENOTLD, and a very informative interview with Eastman. Bottom Line: Lame porn, but even weaker as a horror movie. Either get real porn or watch real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
