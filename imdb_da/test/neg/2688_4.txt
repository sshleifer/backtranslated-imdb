This movie is truly amazing, over the years I have gained a taste for Japanese Monster movies and are well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor. But this one comes to a new low as it follows Johnny Sokko's adventures (?), A young boy who manages a virgin robot and his battle against the evil Gargoyle Gang, which seems to have an endless supply of horrendous giant monsters on their disposal.
