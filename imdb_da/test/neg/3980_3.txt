Like most other people, I watched this movie at "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it received some well-deserved barbs, it is one of the better movies to show on that show. The premise is better than even your average Hollywood blockbuster these days; It constitutes some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also gives a couple of wonderful moments when Richard walks by the river. When you watch the movie, you can see how many plot developments are likely to look very good on paper. Riker's discomfort in modern society is an interesting issue to consider, and the end would probably have been a good 70-inch mindfuck if the previous things had not been so stupid. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is visibly inexpensive, making the errors more apparent. The "clone farm" is very obviously a college campus, and a beer can serve as a large plot point. Lena and Richard have zero chemistry - we must believe that this is a meeting with related minds, but there doesn't seem to be a brain cell between them. The "cranky old couple" schtick also gets really old, really fast. There are also some errors that may be due to poor management choices, such as. The decision to hold a climate call outside the reach of any audio equipment. In all, it is a noble effort, but it is nevertheless best seen on MST3K.
