I saw this cooking show a couple of times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Only one question ..... Who can't make a patch with regular meal for 30 minutes when all you need is present, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except Chop some green. In addition, almost all cooking shows are in 30 minutes, and most of these cooks do all their prep work (except Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh and yep .... they also do full meals. <br /> <br /> Love the comment of the guy who hated the "EVOO" comment. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid tag words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious .... a tall, gregarious woman who really is her own best audience. She laughs at her own lame comments, curls too many times for the camera, because she will convince us that she is as good as she thinks. <br /> <br /> No she's not "the cutest thing". She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
