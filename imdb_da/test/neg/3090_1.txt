what a waste of time! I expected better from cameron diaz! I think it wasn't really her fault for being in a horrible movie. the film does not capture Europe's beauty ..... and failed to lead the audience in excitement or wonder. weak attempt at narrative and narrative - dialogue is boring and could not convey what I sometimes think simplicity is beauty. no love, energy, electricity on the screen. too bad !!!!!!!! 1
