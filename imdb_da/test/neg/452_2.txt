Rose ?? Is there anything in this episode? It introduces our two leaders, a slow-paced laughing idiot by a doctor and a completely uninteresting companion. There is no plot to talk about, childish humor, mixed with some extremely bad pacing and random music. What's more to say, really? <br /> <br /> End of the world ?? A marginal improvement as we see our first outer space scenario. Subsequently brought down by poor modern humor, paper-thin logic, very poor pacing and tired SF clichés. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead ?? Best episode to date shows what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write an interesting character dialogue, and integrate an exciting map. Leave Doctor and Rose alone. <br /> <br /> Aliens of London / World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the matter a little weighty and tries its best in bad conditions. Some poorly written and out-of-place soap operas appear in these two episodes, and a return to poor pacing, poor plotting, and cringe worthy humor / satire. <br /> <br /> Dalek ?? Not great, but still far above the RTD ticket price to date. Pacing and scripting are all fine (though Doctor and Rose are still annoying). Dalek's impact and threat are well introduced. The final, however, took an interesting premise that reduced the doctor's most infamous enemy, in a twisted touch, and turned a former dishonest threat into a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The long game - The first RTD script to show a plot, even though it was in a clichéd 80s style. Still, it was somewhat terrible by his usual over-dependence on juvenile jokes, placing it too far in the future to create logical sensation and again poor pacing. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial assumption could have been vaguely interesting, but sense and logic leave this episode from the beginning. We are also treated to an entire episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking it is about characterization, remember, there is a big difference between lame soap surgery and characterization. On the plus side it turns out that RTD is not the worst script writer so far. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / Dancing Dances - This started in a mediocre way, with some scary worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even an elementary school student would not (well-lit windows in a blackout, anyone?) . Then the first part takes a more interesting and eerie trip. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes and shows us what an interesting companion might have been like. She could also act. Instead, we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion. The conclusion was a little quick but adequate. Pacing and scripting are improved with a reasonably good story, making these two episodes quite atmospheric and exciting. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I had been so disillusioned with the current series that I saw and did the trailer to another 'Slitheen' episode not I am not exposed to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, which is really the worst facet of the modern media, is basically used as a prerequisite. There is no subtlety at all. Do we get some interesting social comments like in The Running Man or Truman Show? No, of course not. This in an FTD episode, so they are basically here to cynically try and draw in the audience of those shows. Once again, the logic goes out of the window as we are placed 200,000-a-year in the future. RTD is trying, with the aim of shoe horns in an "over-arcing" story here, irrelevant to its own existence and when the bad guys are revealed at the end ... They make empty threats and the doctor laughs once again as an idiot for climax ! Faster paced for the most part than RTD's other efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise it is another unclear installment. <br/> <br /> Parting Off The Road - The Big Final. More of a damp squid, literally. All the Dalek threats created in 'Dalek' slow down as they become quite pathetic. So many plot holes riddle this episode, with typically poor contrivances. Dalek wants to harvest people like Daleks, but then evaporate the entire continents? Daleks can evaporate the continents, but not destroy Tardis in space? Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over people, so they can be saved in it? This ability cannot be used to easily destroy Dalek's god? The Daleks can evaporate the entire continent, but not just call satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and instead let him play around? The doctor is a pathetic sweep without conviction of his actions, after eradicating all his nature to try to remove Daleks? These as well as many other holes aside, we are treated to the lamest du's ex machina solution ever conceived, along with a near meaningless story arch. So what can we say about the new series, all-in-all? <br /> <br /> Would this have been given a different series if it were anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything but un-original and forgettable if they were other than Doctor Who, and had the RTD's name attached? I do not think. <br /> <br /> Some people want us to say nothing to the RTD as we owe him to bring Doctor Who back to our screens. But this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I would rather not have a badly planned, poorly thought out product, combed out for that price. I'd rather wait for someone to come together and make a real effort. For the most part, it is the kind of puerile waste that gives SF a bad name that avoids what is otherwise the most creative genre.
