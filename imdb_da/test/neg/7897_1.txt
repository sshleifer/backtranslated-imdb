This could probably be the worst movie ever made up there in a league with films like "Howard the Duck", "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Ishtar." I don't understand why I decided to watch this movie as it was a waste of my life. I also don't understand why you would like this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. The act is among the worst I have ever seen, like the writing. The characters are all stupid and there is not a funny scene in the whole movie. Tom Arnold may be the worst actor ever - this movie proves it. There is nothing worthy of this movie. Don't rent it, don't look at it, don't even say it looks interesting. It's bad enough, I saw it.
