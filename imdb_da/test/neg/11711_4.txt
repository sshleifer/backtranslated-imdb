I was fortunate enough to read the book in advance and I know a little about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> Writing and editing this movie was mostly really horrible. I felt that I saw a really bad drama doc about the period then a movie. First there were too many cuts between important parts. And out of important events that happened at that time, a henry fell out with Rome over his desire to separate from Katherine of Aragon, which led to England beating away from Rome and establishing its own church. they barely held onto the book. I am far too creative freedom, but at a limit, especially when dealing with a well-written book as your starting point. in the book Maria gives birth to young Catherine first and then she has young Henry born. Both their father is Henry's eight. in the film they show harry's first da Catherine. And suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the movie to write them all. <br /> <br /> I would say, however, that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone depicted the Boleyn sisters probably the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book and don't know anything about Hennry's 8-court, I'd recommend staying away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the movie will annoy you because it lacks detail and important plot.
