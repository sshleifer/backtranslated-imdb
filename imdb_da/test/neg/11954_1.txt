I have a friend who works on blockbuster and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week, so one day when we scoured the hallways for something interesting, I stumbled over 18 weapons by Kung Fu and judging by the box alone, this movie seemed right wack, but we nevertheless gave temptation and rented it - after that it was free ..... and thank God it was .... this is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen .... the budget must have been a pickle and a piece of string ... the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 weapons" is that there is a book that teaches the way to the 18 weapons a bad guy is after - and that's it ! there are not even firefighters in this movie ... it and the action sequences are just flat-out BAD .... 9 times out of 10 the other guy's battles and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guy and there is many times when the movie will skip frames (a result of ridiculously bad editing) .... the dubbing is just as ridiculous and it is hardly even understandable .... and we will not even get into the play. .. the end will surely leave you saying "wtf ??" but to be fair I must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent and the old guy is a crazy chump ... ... but it's about it ... luckily I didn't have to pay for this movie, but at least I think now, I know exactly how bad a movie can actually be ....
