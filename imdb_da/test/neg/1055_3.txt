*** Possible spoiler, but certainly not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called Donkey Kong, but Donkey Kong is not even in it <br /> <br /> anymore! Diddy is also gone! <br /> <br /> The first Donkey Kong Country was one of my two favorite favorite Nintendo games. (The second is Super Mario World) The 2nd Donkey Kong had at least diddy king and good levels, though it felt more like a game based on pirates at times. <br /> <br /> But this is the worst of the party! It doesn't have the feeling of <br /> <br /> the original or the other, the enemy's appearance is stupid and the levels are even worse. It doesn't look more realistic! I didn't like his game as opposed to the last two, the first had great <br /> <br /> background music and the other was not bad, but the music in this <br /> <br /> game is terrible! <Br /> <br /> It is a lot of these days that movies, shows and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start out amazingly end up being ruined by a stupid sequel! I'm sorry to say that donkey king as a saga is not so good <br /> <br /> now that it has Donkey Kong 3! They should have left it on the original or maybe the other.
