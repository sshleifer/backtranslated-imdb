OK, here's the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem suspending much of the unbeliever over plot holes or other incredible acts. But this movie went far beyond minor errors and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me get it straight. The police send a notorious gangster and police officer (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. They then have to stop at an area where just two police work, one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burnout. Apparently, the building was being shut down, so the police decided in a way that everyone else in the entire district got the evening to New Year's Eve. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne turns out to take Fishburne out before he can rat him and other dirty police out. (although we never find out about their relationship or relationship). Interestingly, the police are launching the attack on the neighborhood in full SWAT gear with night vision goggles, assault rifles, nine yards. Later, they even bring in a helicopter with more people in full gear. I'm not a policeman, but I'm pretty sure you can't just roll out of the station with a whole swat platon worthy of equipment without anyone asking what you're doing. And the police helicopter ??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm ??? Also, no one near the area happens to hear or see this great siege going on with flash grenades and heavy duty fire going out? I mean seriously, move on. I know this is set in Detroit, but even there it would suspect an apparent top secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the jug still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these issues if there were any other problems. First, the open few minutes of the movie are nicely shot in a very frenetic and hyperactive way, and I thought to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The rest of the movie has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. The "signs" are not related to each other in any way, which is probably mainly due to their not being particularly interesting. There are not enough interesting actions to make this a good action movie and there is not enough character development / storytelling to make this an acceptable thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing that the director himself tries to make interesting or intense. Oh and by the way, the last scene in the desert? Uh, I thought this was in the middle of a worn industrial part of Detroit and suddenly we are in the woods ?? The action is not horrible in this movie, it's just that director and writing are terrible. I really enjoy some of Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Denney's other movies, but this one is horrible.
