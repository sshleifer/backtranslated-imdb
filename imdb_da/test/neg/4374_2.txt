Chuck Norris stars like Danny, a policeman who knocked down a hulking serial killer, but when that killer escapes, Danny knows he's the only one who can stop the terror. But Danny has a secret, he knows it was really lucky that the terror was arrested and, fortunately, that Danny survived, now there is a last blow, but is Danny ready? Right here in my description tells what the problem with this movie is. Norris plays a wimpy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could create a fantastic thriller. In the hands of a Norris thriller, it just makes ridiculous and hopelessly unfortunate. Also on board is American Ninjas Steve James and Superfly's Ron O'Neal, but any attempt at character development is defeated by the terrible script. Also, there is hardly any action and I have always preferred a Norris movie with more games and less to talk. In view of the assessment on this website, I must not be alone. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
