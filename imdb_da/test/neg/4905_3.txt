This low-budget film about a writer working at a London casino has a horrible script, wood performance and not much to recommend. Of course, it will appeal to highbrows for whom "mainstream" is a curse word and which automatically adds 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (sorry Jeff Foxworthy). The scripture is full of holes (has he written a book yet or not?), Clichés (relationship issues: she works days, he works nights) and gives so little insight into such reasons as character motivation that it requires a voice-over story only to move the story together. <br /> <br /> In an effort to keep the audience off, it includes a street fighting scene that is as realistic as a high school production by Julius Caesar. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​scintillating dialogue is "I want to see your ten and raise you twenty," then run to watch this movie. Otherwise save your money. <br /> <br />
