The presentation is very shabby. (for my performance) as documentaries are often. Michael Moore's "Dokumenatri" - Farenheit 911 is far more convincing, but has FAR too much media and political influence. Can't wait until Saturday when I see docudrama "The Game of their Lives". IFC goes straight to the center. I have started a collection of IFC movies from the Internet because of "TGOTL" *** out of ********** on "Decade". Want to see good documentaries? Stick to History Channel .. Or try docudrama. You can't go wrong with my friend. Can't go wrong. The 70s were ten years of reruns. Or the old times would make you believe. Disco died and it is gone forever. When Elvis died o yes we all took care
