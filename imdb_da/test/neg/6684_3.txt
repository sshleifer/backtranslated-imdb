First, the latest campaign of this movie is a huge hoax. Judging from the cover, you would think it was a kind of scandal about Kylie that played a character who had sex, drugs and anything. This is just a cheap market organization. She's right in it and doesn't do any of it. The marketing here is unbelievable and I am surprised the filmmakers have not objected. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie itself was a huge disappointment. It looked like a Sunset Beach episode directed dullly by a teenage Quentin Tarantino. And it's not the meaning of a compliment, think of you. <br /> <br /> I think the film's weakness is first and foremost the story. It seems to be about nothing. Almost cool teenagers stumble around live 'on the edge'. However, the characters themselves have some personality, but the film does not use its potential. As I said, there is no story about any substance here. It seems to deepen too much on a cool dialogue and end up looking like a colorful MTV ad. It certainly has that feeling. <br /> <br /> However, I think some people may enjoy it, but I would say there are far better movies like this one around.
