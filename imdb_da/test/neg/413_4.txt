Review: Angels & Demons <br /> <br /> The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He has also made famous films such as The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He also directed the famous television series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: Phantom Menace,? ?). <br /> <br /> Initially, I was shocked because they changed the start of the movie so much. Because they changed father to Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) in another, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was great that they could film on the spot in CERN. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues. They are spectacular car races in Rome. One I also like the part of the Chirstian Archives much when they destroy Galileo's work, it was fun. It was also fun that, when locked in the archives the second time they came in, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives, and when they break out, does the electricity come on? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not go to the helicopter, but that Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) comes in alone, another detail is that in the film Camerlengo is an adoptive son from the Pope. In the book he is the Pope's true son. <br /> <br /> To give the best play I have to say Pierfrancesco Favino, who plays Olivetti's inspector. The worst deal was from the murderer, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was under-driving because he played in Adams Apple's Faboulous. I think the whole movie is subversive because director Ron Howard made some many stupid changes. I would rate the movie at 4/10.
