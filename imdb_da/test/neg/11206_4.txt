This could have been a great movie if anyone just wanted to know how to finish the movie. The story just went fine and went towards the point in each movie like this, where the "gray" characters become "good" and the "bad" guys get their just desserts and * boom * ... it's as if they ran out for the script and just started to do things. <br /> <br /> Which wouldn 'I have been so bad ... if the casting just continued with the character development they had already put in place. But that is not the case, and the film soon becomes a filthy mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie for the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. At this point you can imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look from what you've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me the end you come up with will look much better than how this movie actually ends. Trust me about this.
