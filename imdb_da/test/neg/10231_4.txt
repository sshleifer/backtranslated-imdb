I had to rent a few movies for my little cousin for New Year, and she chose the Swan Princess: The Enchanted King's and The Little Mermaid's Mystery 2, and we just looked at both movies while she was sleeping I figured I could get a few comments in. :) While this is a very cheesy cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. You have to admit that for children, these charts are new to them, and it can be a good introduction to these stories to them. Odette finds out that Derek secretly kept the magic secrets of Rosthoe and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but he is a guy, typically he does not and tells her that it could not reach the magic without his help . When a witch named Zelda gets her hands on, she finds out that Derek tore out the last words with a spell she wants to use to destroy everything and she kidnaps Odette to retrieve that information. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess: The enchanted king's mystery is stupid and predictable, but for the children I would honestly say it is a trip. It is so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now for a few days, so I have to cut the film a little slack. It was just strange to see all the voices suddenly change, I grew up with the first one, so I assumed it was just stuck in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
