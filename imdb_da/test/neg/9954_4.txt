Pretty asked PRC cheapie, which I rarely find difficult to see again, and it is no wonder - it is slow and creaking and boring as a butter knife. The wrong doctor George Zucco is again turning a dim farm hand in overalls (Glenn Strange) to a wolfman. Unfortunately, the makeup is virtually non-existent, consisting only of beard and dimestore fangs for the most part. If it wasn't for Zucco and Strange's presence with the sweet Anne Nagel, it would be completely unmatched. Strangely, who would continue to play Frankenstein's monster for the United States in two years, seems a Lenny impression from "Of Mice and Men". <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
