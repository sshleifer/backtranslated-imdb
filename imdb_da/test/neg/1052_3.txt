Physical proof is one of the movies you will like, but really should be much better than it actually is. Developed as a successor to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that everyone involved only did so while waiting for something better to come together. The prerequisite is perfectly applicable, it is mostly technically effective if it is terribly uninspired with even Henry Mancini's musacky score surprisingly comfortable, but you can't help feeling things would have proven better if one of the leaders turned out to be the killer (who is rumored was originally the case). As the opening scene for his little set, personally catastrophic Heat (1986) showed, Reynolds has everything that makes himself a big screen villain. As there are few surprises and a sense of half-hearted recordings of numbers, as it builds an intertie head as it is uninteresting towards a less than grand will-this-do? finale. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is fine, sailing through charisma in what is clearly a star car. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Theresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress in Nic Roeg's film, which allows her to dive into the darker side of human nature, she is trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth, and she does not have it in spades. She does not flee her lines or encounter other actors, but it is all about what can be said for her amazingly stylish and often amateur performance, which makes the movie poorly. Apart from Ned Beatty's Prosecutor, the support only adds a slightly surrealistic presence in a Boston, where everybody seems to have a badly prejudiced Canadian accent, and the streets have an amazing resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Likewise, director Michael Crichton, who in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery showed he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats, seems to handle the action on a purely perfunctory way - yes, in a short hunt the shoots don't match and seem to be thrown together almost arbitrarily. The climate itself has no flair and is totally afraid of threat or danger, and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth. It is not very surprising that Crichton has not addressed himself since the 13th Warrior. It is not enough to watch in an 80's television movie, even though it never lives up to the promise of its opening. Whether it's enough of a reason to see it, it's for individual taste.
