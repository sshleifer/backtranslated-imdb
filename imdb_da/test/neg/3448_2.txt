Two Stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer looks like a young version of his father, Christopher Plummer in a row, stars in this movie with Robert Forster - who should really have put a little shoe black on top of the bald spot. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these little crazy characters in movies that don't completely fill up and she does it again in this. First, we have two young women, sisters who do not look at least, who allow themselves to be picked up separately by questionable men along roads. <br /> <br /> At least, Amanda's character, Sandra, has a good reason to allow Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) to get her in the first place. She has been driven off the road, apparently by a madman, and her car is largely destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning - Front Spoilers! <br /> <br /> But when we go together, we realize that Dr. Jake doesn't play with a full tire more than Amanda. He makes all decisions based on a coin. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel, who can we see, but the madman's car and what does Amanda do but get into his station wagon and start snooping around. What her motive was to do this is never clear given that the man is apparently dangerous and may be trying to kill her. One would think that the last thing she would do is place herself in such an uncertain situation. <br /> <br /> Not only does she sneak around, but she finds some money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Shortly after that we have several other things that don't fill up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as his passenger, runs out of gas and the two leave their car and start walking. One would think to cross a desert, he would have checked his gas meter - it seems like a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen. Later he is seen driving the same car. When or how did he get the car back? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows she has taken the money. Now how would he know it? He didn't see her do it as far as I know, and she didn't tell her she did. <br /> <br /> Later, we have a sign by the name of Santini (David Thewlis), the man who was driving the station wagon, giving them two lifts and I being darned if he didn't know, Amanda also took the money. How would he know it? <br /> <br /> The longer we go, the less credibility at an alarming rate. <br /> <br /> When Alice comes to Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk) in the killer's couplings and decides her fate on throwing a coin - one would think she would be very, very careful that the coin she's switching to a trick coin, surely would be the trick coin - but it doesn't seem to be. <br /> <br /> It's crushing stuff like this that destroys any credibility this movie may have had.
