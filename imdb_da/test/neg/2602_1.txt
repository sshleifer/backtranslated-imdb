You know what? Family Guy started out as something fresh, fun and more original. The random humor used to be fun. I used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to The Simpsons. Having seen the new episodes that aired the last few weeks; I grew up with the show, relying too much on random humor to be fun. South Park was right about FG's death when they took up Manatees and the idea balls. <br /> <br /> And then the show itself, I don't understand why my parents like it so much; There is nothing good about it. The "intellectual" humor is fun and would have been more fun if the show was not by chance.
