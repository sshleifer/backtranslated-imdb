I'm sorry movies that leave entertaining in a linear synopsis, so end up matching what you would find at the bottom of a compost hanger. Who knows: "Witchery" may have eased interesting in a pitch for studios, even with a big name cast (like Blair and Hasselhoff - flashing flashes, nudge-nudge) and the roaring Hildegard Knef (I'm not a woman ...) . <br /> <br /> But on film it just falls faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainy weather. Seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern coast, and one of them (a woman I will guess) is targeted by a satanic cult carrying the hell-child while the others are practiced in grotesque , lopsided ways. Okay, right here you have a cross section of plots from "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and a few other smaller films in the satanic worshipers-run-amok line. None of it is very entertaining and for the most part you will crawl your way from stage to stage until it's over. <br /> <br /> No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help a lot. They are just in it to get a paycheck and do not seem to be very intent on giving it their "all". <br /> <br /> Based on that, Hasselhoff probably wants him back on the brook with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... Well, who knows; a celebrity peta benefit or pro-am golf trip or whatever it is she is up to today. <br /> <br /> And the torture scene! Ecchhhh. You get to see people get their mouths sewn, closed up in roaring fireplaces, tied up in trees during a violent storm, vessels bursting out of the neck, etc. Sheesh and I thought "Mark of the Devil" was the most sadistic movie I had seen .... not bothering. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you as much as I did. If you see it, just see if you can count the clich√©s. And yes, Blair gets obsessed, as if you're not coming down Main Street, followed by a marching band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches will give you itching.
