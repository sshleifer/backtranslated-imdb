Yes Pigeon and Coburn are amazing and it's interesting to see them, though Coburn seems quite restrained and boring here. It is fun to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 1970s, and period cars and clothing. It's all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad as most of the actor is. Ray and Sandy's motivations seem compelled and unlikely. I've seen this "exercise to be a pickpocket" routine several times before. There is a long structure that leads to nothing. Better catching an episode of "Streets of San Francisco", or one of the many great crimes / caper movies. To name a few, there is Bedtime Story, recreated as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting and Best of All, the House of Games.
