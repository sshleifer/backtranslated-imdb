Can anyone explain why anyone would like to make a British neo-noir crime movie with a cast almost entirely American? The accents spoken in this movie are bloody awful! But completely in line with the performance, which is so wood, you fear to fight to put the fire on. <br /> <br /> Really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is this? Even neo-noir movies have any sign you either feel or feel for, even though they are miserable and doomed; they have at least some decency to them, some sense that what they have done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that they somehow are stuck with the responsibility of it. <br /> <br /> Not in this stanky stew. These characters are spoiled, betray each other, themselves and the audience. <br /> <br /> Also note that they are alive - okay, nothing wrong with it - except that they seem to live a life of luxury. For a movie supposedly of desperate petty thieves, the keynote is here - yet. It's so terribly boring and dross, Doncha knows. So let's just tear some people away or maybe murder them, and let's put in a luxury hotel. What an ambition! <br /> <br /> Making this whole mess to some bottom of the swamp muck is: boring bumpy pacing; predictable 'action' sequences that are not banal and incoherent set of designs; TV camera work and editing; Forgettable score; and a whole lack of imagination or innovation in production and direction. <br /> <br /> Absolutely unbelievable, unlikely and for less-dedicated movie watchers (or masochists) like myself, totally unatchable. <br /> <br /> There are other unpleasant things I would like to say about this nasty movie, but they wouldn't print them here. Suffice it to say that you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than to watch this movie - almost anything.
