Which bird is that? And Malt Falcon. The only thing that is far fun about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Who has more depth and character than the man under it. <br /> <br /> Malta's settings are so dry and as incomplete as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime film etc. ... seems stubborn and simply stupid without the salvation of any humor or pertinency. The reason why this movie has no 'long life' and almost forgotten is that it is so vacuum, an hour and a half of pointless time in the company of the second movement actors and filmmakers. This movie is what the title suggests ...
