I usually do not write reviews, I never actually write reviews. This movie was so horrible that it actually inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality tries to be a light hearted and naughty teenage comedy for the usual traps; virginity, boys, etc., except the protagonist, seems to be his perfect boy, whom she has created using a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sound interesting? Well, it's not. The action is the most half-hearted and terrible thing I have ever seen. The unfortunate thing is that they seem to be genuine support for scripts and movies, which probably explains why I've never seen them in any memorable production since. I have not bothered to learn the actors' names or their characters. The charging lady doesn't play or charm you, and you don't care about her. The chief lady's male friend creates no sympathy, even when the manuscript calls screaming for you to shame him. The only rise he comes out of you is an extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half-decent actor was the blonde leading man who, in spite of his weak weakness, really gave everything he could, which was not much in the light of such a terrible job. I do not even want to talk about the acting abomination that is 'bad' in the plot. But then again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie unfold as I had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the stupid audacity to write such a script, produce, act and control it. I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I continued to see such a lack of film was the disbelieving laughter that managed to emerge from us as coherence, logic, class, and even countless history were ignored within half an hour in the movie. I have no idea why anyone wanted to violate the film industry by releasing it to the public. This is a joke of a movie and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. If so.
