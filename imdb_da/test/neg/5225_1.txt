I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This film was made in 2003, and I've seen movies made in the 60s with better special effects. I wish I could go into details, but words cannot describe how crappy this movie was. I could have done better with a home camcorder and $ 20! I ask that Chuck Norris never make a movie again. Now, if you think I'm downing this movie because it has a Christian theme, you're wrong. I like the fact that IL 'Chuck decided to make a movie that at least tried to make God look good, but why would he get poor viewers like me to suffer through such a crazy movie? This whole movie can be summed up in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
