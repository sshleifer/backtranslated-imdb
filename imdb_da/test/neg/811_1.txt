Seen in 1945, Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, he is a wandering disaster that causes chaos wherever he goes. The train also scares a man and his mistress to murder the man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier heading home, two gay older gentlemen, an angry train manager, two nuns, a bunch of refugees and even more people. Meaning a mix of noir-ish thriller (as it does pretty well - at least to begin with) and comedy, the movie fails with both. It's not right, as the film changes tone with each new scene. And when the train runs towards its final destination, the movie becomes increasingly bizarre, ending with a truly surreal note. The good bits are wasted in a myriad of meaningless plots and characters. Apparently, it is filled with famous Swedish actors, no matter how small it is. It feels like the filmmakers called everyone they ever worked with and offered them a role in the movie. Too bad the performances are as bad as the script (follow your lines - don't read them!). The comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same jokes repeated again and again. The pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often actually) with especially pulling for about ten minutes without any good reason. Screenwriter also seems to believe that gang is a good way to replace a decent dialogue. However, the film looks good in moody B & W, but it is wasted on such unfortunate film production in all other departments. [1.10]
