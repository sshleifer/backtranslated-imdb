Ravi Chopra wrote this movie 40 years ago, wanted to throw Dilip Kumar in the lead <br /> <br /> The movie was finally rewritten and made in 2003, and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times <br /> <br /> Just as the reason why Amitabh-Hema is separated, it is too superficial, even the way the youth is shown is too bad as Gulshan in AVTAAR. However, the message comes well, but things are presented in a clich√©d way Salman's character is worst, looking straight out of a storybook, while Bachchan's climax is good, and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good. Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent song song by Bachchan stands out <br /> <br /> Amitabh excels as always, he has played an older grandfather before, but here he plays a sacrifice and portrays it well Hans last talk is great Hema is good in his part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is okay, Naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent, although Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fa Ke, Mahima is okay Paresh and Lillete are lovable
