Missed it at the cinema, but was always a little forced. Found it in the ejection tray in my local video store for an abusive two bucks! Will I now give it away to anyone who wants it? Probably! No purposeful plot, one-dimensional character, plastic world ripped off by many much better movies, no decent dialogue to talk about. Do you know the empty feeling when you come down from ecstasy? Its that feeling right here. Sad things are, Australia, I know, goes in this direction, minus the melodrama and simple answers. Only interesting to see the older Aussie actors (who had to act back in their day to come by) vs the newer Aussie actors (who have to look good). Like a horrible, confidential introduction to a movie clip that never actually starts ... Poor Kylie, also started his career as an actress ...
