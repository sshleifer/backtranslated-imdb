I'm thinking of some things for this movie: First, it's really a very bad movie. This is really "Superbad". The movie looked very promising on trailers, but fell flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and the malfunctioning movie became boring and empty. My advice is not wasting 2 hours of your precious time. You have been warned. This is the first movie I've rated 1 star on IMDb.com ... Second, none of the characters are sympathetic. You really don't care what happened to them ... Third, the villain is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes the friend's son, gets the girl pregnant, forges his grandfather ... As JT says, "If you like evil without retaliation, this is your movie". Nothing more to say ...
