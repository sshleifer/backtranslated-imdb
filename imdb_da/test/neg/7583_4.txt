Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst instructor, and he did a good job on the undervalued sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (including "Schwarzenegger Box Office Office"). But "Air America" ​​should be one of his most scary projects. It comes across as a merger between drama, comedy and war film - it is not a very convincing mix. In fact, I found it to be overbearing. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr. (during his heyday) stars as a pilot recruited to a top secret CIA organization operating in Laos in the Vietnam era. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot, and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they are dealing with drugs and what not. <br /> <br /> The movie was hyped on release because the star's two famous faces, and Aerosmith had resumed the door's classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Ready of the song is pretty bad, which fits the movie.
