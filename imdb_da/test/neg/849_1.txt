Italian rip off Mandingo and The Drum is a poorly baptized Italian life on the plant agar. Lots of people who do not look like they belong in the American South, carry poorly tailored costumes and wander around places that don't look like the South American. The reason has something about the romance between a rich man and a particular young woman, the jealousy that follows and the tragedy that follows. The movie promises hot steaming sex and lots of distorted violence, but nothing ever really comes from any of it, it's all right. Its all probably the breed's insensitive, I couldn't notice since it's artistic bankruptcy. The last twist is at best ridiculous. A big turkey.
