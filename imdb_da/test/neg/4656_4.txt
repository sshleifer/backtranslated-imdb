Like its close contemporary "The Great Race" and "Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines", I always connect this movie with my childhood, especially in New Year. On New Year's Day we wanted to visit my grandmother and after lunch while the adults were talking, the kids would watch TV, where there would always be one of those three crazy race movies. <br /> <br /> For that reason alone, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo or Bust" well, but I fear I can't, the child is not the father of the man on this occasion. Where I think I can see all too clearly his mistakes, and while I was tempted to smile occasionally, I would probably have all the competitors come to the end of the race long before they actually do. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is dated by the stereotypes of nationalities and women as the weaker sex, and I also do not care much for one or two fraudulent, albeit mild, vulgarities that occasionally discovered. More than that, cast in spite of hamming it scary just doesn't sell the movie enough. Tony Curtis, in a test drive for his "Yank Abroad" tour of the television series "The Persuaders", seems too old to play the young gal, Terry Thomas is just not dastartly enough, Eric Sykes is incredible as a dirty-minded Lothario while Gert Frobe as an overdone of Teuton, is just odd to make camp comedy when you remember he was Bond's best villain Goldfinger. If anything the English players come out best - Susan Hampshire is at least engaging as a "bright young thing", appropriate gamine like a posh flapper, and even though it is chained to the Pete and Dud script, it offers the most entertainment that rigid overlapping hearth types, even though the "Carry On" team did so much better in "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass". <br /> <br /> Director Annakin is trying to evoke "Golden Silents" with slapstick lashings, erroneous identity creators, faster camera image, would be dramatic stunts and little light romance, but there is no real excitement for such a famous race and, in the end, it seems to be another messenger. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would have given it another brand if they stuck to the alternative title "The Magnificent Men in their Jaunty Jalopies", but in truth the animated series "Wacky Races" made it so much better.
