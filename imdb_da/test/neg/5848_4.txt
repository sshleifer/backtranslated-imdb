SPOILERS ALL: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film differs completely from the book (Not that the book was a classic, but it was really very good.) I think Demi Moore was ok. In fact, I don't really remember much about her performance in one way or another. But the big disappointment was not with Mrs Moore. Why did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire get a heart? (I refer to him as the "millionaire" because he also had a different name in the film than the book version - just another change.) People who did not read the book of course won I do not know what is different, but in the BOOK version this is guy much more ruthless and complex overall. He is also fascinating. The fact that such a big change was made in the film changes the whole plot. It was almost like watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know many movies vary a lot from the books. But I also thought that Redford's character was a bit of a wimp. This is not Redford's fault (he is a great actor and could have played recklessly well) but without these qualities he just becomes another dazzled man in love, and the story therefore becomes just another clich√© love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. It wasn't really the point in the book. <br /> <br /> This could have been much better. Although I had not read the book version, I would not have liked it all so much, but changing so much around certainly takes me a few points down.
