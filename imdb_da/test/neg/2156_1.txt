I love a good western movie, but it was more like watching a piece on stage or an action at the local street carnival show. I could only stand for 38 minutes hoping it would get better, but it only got worse and I had to finish it. Each actor (s) indicated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards. There was too much predictability for the lines and actions not as a natural occurrence or conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses playing Indian sisters could have played non-original parts and should have. The wardrobe for the Indians could have been better and a little more authentic looking. If I decide to see it with friends in the future, I will do so, not with the expectation of seeing a good Western, but with the expectations of seeing an amateur comedy movie production.
