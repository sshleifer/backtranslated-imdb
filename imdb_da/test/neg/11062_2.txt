A virtual carbon copy of The Cave stores for fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie went downhill as I saw the fake campfires blazing brightly reflected in a face's close-up of one of the actors. The conflicts between the signs and the subplots did not seem to be any kind of purpose and added nothing to the film, with the exception of fewer moments of silence. The action was not as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some credibility in their fears, but as professional cavers they seem to be too mentally unstable for their chosen profession. Overall not worth wasting $ 4.50 for rent.
