Let me preface this by going on record, I'm a big George Clooney fan and I love John Krasinski in 'The Office'. Now I was and I did. <br /> <br /> This was the world's worst tack and took 113 minutes to tear it off. The stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over. <br /> <br /> Every fun scene was in the previews. All three of them. There was no real story, no sign development, and the manuscript was just pretty bad. I've had a colonoscopy that was more fun. <br /> <br /> The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This movie is a lock for a Razzie. It would get a whole slough of Razzies. I want my money back.
