My boss at the time and showed it to us at a Halloween party in our office. He is Chris Huntley, who co-authored and acted in it. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad, and we all agree that the monster looks way too much like a vagina as a coincidence. Perhaps it had gone wrong from a gynecological experiment. <br /> <br /> It was a very low budget and the actors were all friends, so what you have here is a case of "hi gang, let's put a show". <br /> <br /> No one was injured and it was a first attempt. Nothing wrong with that. It gave us all a good laugh, and it's a good movie to watch with friends and have fun. :-)
