I was a little old for this show I was 6 when it first came out. Only when I was a child were there a couple of children's shows that were on sesame street, which I saw and learned, but apart from that there was not much else. My cousins ​​were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one to come later. Barney was a very large part of what they looked at. When I first saw this show, I told my grandmother how it didn't teach anything, just use magic to fix everything. I was 9 at the time when many 9 years have any idea what is really going on with a TV show. More and more, I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were more and more, I told people how bad the show was. The fun is my parents who had a young child in the middle to the late 80s, which was me by the way. They agreed and said the same as I did. The sad thing about this is my cousins ​​who are older now 13 and so still agree with what they saw. It's not cheating on its creative, it's not right to think differently than anyone tells you. Its also to steal if the person doesn't find out it's gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney is out to make money, don't teach children anything. The more flashy the program the more likely children will be seeing it. Children are stupid, not because they are not educated, they just do not know better, others Barney put a show and parents bought it. I never thought television could affect people like Barney does. If you have a kid read to them, watch a show that teaches them numbers, don't let them get involved in this show. Barney is like smoking once is too much, smoking a couple and your hooked let your child see this show they are hooked and one day their kids will see the same crap and buy the same crap you bought
