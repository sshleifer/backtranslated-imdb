This oddity contains Bunuel-like touches, but does not maintain one's interest. A 10-year-old escapes a bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual cult film-makers (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious actions in the name of the comedy. Like his AFTERTIMES and VAMPIRE'S KISS, you look forward to getting scared. I was unchanged because of the broad play. You know that you are part of it when the flesh and flea provide the most appealing perches. (And what did this child's screen test think? He's insufficient.) Recommended for the dozen or so fans of SONNY BOY ('87).
