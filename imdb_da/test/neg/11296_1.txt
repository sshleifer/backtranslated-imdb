One of the worst theatrical films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins highlights himself by appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career movement Jody Foster ever made was about this. Julianne Moore was as emotional as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course his brilliant self. He is a stupid victim of Hannibal, and the makeup is so good I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained wild boar ??? Give me a break! Rumor has it that he didn't want his name mentioned in the credits himself. And roast and feed his own brain to Ray Liotta ... I laughed at the absurdity, nobody does the stupidity of this flick at this time. I haven't seen so many people go out of a movie since, who is that girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else to go to you if you need to, but miss this at all costs !!!
