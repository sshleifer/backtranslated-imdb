Concorde ... Airport '79 starts in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) contacts senior television news reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to hand over secret documents of what shows his boss Kevin Harriosn ( Robert Wagner) owner and president of Harrison Industries, who develops weapons for the military, has illegally sold the said weapons to foreign countries, but Maggie sees Carl murdered & she almost escapes with her life, Maggie will catch Concorde to Moscow via Paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on Harrison, who also happens to be her boyfriend who wants to destroy him, he decides to save himself and reprogram his hi-tech 'Buzzard' homing missile to capture and destroy Concorde during a test drive to kill all those aboard & destroy the proven evidence ... Renamed Airport '80 - Concorde for it's cinema and initial home video releases because it was released here in, well, 1980, instead of 1979, this last entry into the airport franchise was conducted by David Lowell Rich and is a notorious bad movie that was apparently laundered during press and test screenings asking Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really stupid and fair daft movie, but on a pure entertainment basis I can think of much worse movies spending 108 minutes watching, I really can. I liked the absurd plot of a wealthy industrialist who wants to kill his girlfriend TV rep before she can expose him as an illegal dealer, but this guy does not subtly and decides the best way to do it by blowing Concorde together With his own guided missile and then get a Fench fighter pilot to try and shoot it down before finally sabotaging it then really there are three mini disaster flicks in one here every time super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the day. You at Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appear in all four airport films and go from mechanic to first to Concorde pilot extrodinaire in this. I also expect him to be a bit of a jinx, as he has been involved in four major aviation disasters for nine years. I think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after this and jinx was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are just stupid, Patroni makes barrel rolls, flies up and down and out maneuvering is a guided missile in a huge Concorde not to mention he crashes landing it and firing flare guns out of the window to destroy the missile all while holding a quiet head. This guy is good, very good. Then there is the sign, which is a saxophone that plays a black guy who smokes weeds in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. Although I almost shot down with a missile and then attacked by a jetfighter, the passengers in Concorde do not seem to be bothered and fortunately come back day by day, I do not know about you, but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel, why do the police or the authorities not ask anyone? Why has Concorde Captain Patroni allowed to just go to sleep with a French prostitute? Concorde ... Airport'79 is certainly not boring and is full of memorable moments and I was entertained in a way, even though it is far from a good movie and modern audiences may not have the patience with it, hell I liked it for what it was in a daring way, but it is not classic. <br /> <br /> Although Concorde no longer flies, it is still a good looking airplane plan and there is plenty of footage of this one used in The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh building . This Concorde was also the same plane that crashed after a tire bust, causing a fuel tank to burst, and the burning fuel burned on July 25, 2000, while leaving in Paris, which resulted in 109 passengers and crew aboard dead. and 4 people died on earth. When this was broadcast on television in the United States in 1982, almost 20 minutes of new recordings were included with most, if not everything was shot over two years after the original production was finished. I know the effects here take a bashing from most, but I don't think they are too bad when considering this was made in the late 70's I think they come across quite well. The camera moves under effects shot, real pictures of real aircraft are used instead of toy models which, in my opinion, would have looked much worse, and I could certainly see what decision makers were trying to do with limited means and limited technology. In a strange way, they are quite impressive, in fact, without looking good if you know what I mean. Probably the most action-packed of all the airport films are missiles, exploding aircraft, bold crash landings, murders and a guy named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) who gives the head a woman in a whirlpool. <br /> <br /> IMDb says this had a budget of about $ 14,000,000, which is actually more than I thought, maybe the special effects aren't that impressive. Shots in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. The action is not amazing here, people do not look worried enough that they are dying. Goerge Kennedy gets some bad one-liners, while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. Concorde ... Airport'79 is fun for bad movie enthusiasts everywhere and to be honest, I'd rather see this entertaining mess of a movie than an Oscar's two-hour nominated drilling.
