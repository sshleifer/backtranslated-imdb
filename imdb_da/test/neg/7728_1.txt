I haven't had the chance to see the previous movie, but from what I've read on other posts, it seemed worse than this, even though I doubt it's possible. I am a big fan of the "Zombie" genre, and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of seeing beings who, for all purposes and purposes, are human, like a cruelty that is only worth shooting in the head. That said, the HOTD 2 Zombie movie takes a whole new low. Without giving some great spoilers (which I really should do so you will not forget your time watching the movie actually) I would like to express my complete contempt for the way the authors of this movie portray our countries Special Forces. Gomer Pile could have survived longer than the "Spec Ops" soldiers in this movie. To cry aloud they should have called them Special Education Forces instead. If you are going to write a script where you send an elite team to handle an outbreak of zombies, at least the soldiers have been wiser than the running bodies. I understand that you have to kill some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than have them put down their machine guns and go over to put a sore hand on the shoulder of the boring, crazy person who rocks back and forth in the corner of the dark, creepy basement. <br /> <br /> In fact, the authors are trying to bring the whole zombie law to a more high-tech level by turning it into a virus for which they are looking for a vaccine, and the idea is profitable if it is not stuck in the middle of Such a ridiculous display of colorless film making. I mean, come on, zombie film isn't exactly "high art," and the viewer expects a heavy cheesiness along with gore and tensions, but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes you disgust and awe of the characters' stupidity . If you are a zombie movie fan like me, do yourself a favor and stay away from this.
