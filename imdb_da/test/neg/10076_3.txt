In summary, my group of friends and I spent approx. 45 minutes outside the theater, which shares our favorites, gaff, plot inconsistencies, unbound runners and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found the story trite to the insignificant point and the plot lines that underdeveloped as dino embryos still locked in shaving canister from Jurassic Park 1. The editing was poor and none of the signs created any kind of sympathy or feeling. In short, this film lacked any kind of excitement and excitement that the first film gave from a historical point of view. Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (though I really enjoyed the pterodactyls.) We got several short shots of the new species and only 2 were really involved in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former childhood palaeontologist, the lack of any real scientific content (not that it should be realistic but logically formed ie how they built dinos in # 1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was disappointing too. <br /> In short, the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to bustle dinos back on stage to make some money. I hope movie-goers will not fall for this trap again (although I apparently did it)
