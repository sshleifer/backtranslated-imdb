"Scientists at a remote laboratory experiment on (insert the scaly creature here) and create uncontrolled monsters. Meanwhile, a crack military team / scientist's daughter / bank robbers find their way to remote locations and are threatened by the giant critters. One by one they are eaten, all in one during an "exciting" race not blown up by the forces that originally created the monsters ... "The sad thing is that it sounds like a dozen movies that have appeared on the Sci -Fi channel. I just wonder what is going on? Sure ... I like bimbos and Hollywood Hunk wannabes being eaten by CGI critters as much as the next person ... but where's the plot or originality? Granted there are times when Sci-Fi Channel Shines. Battlestar Galactica, if it is a little dark, can be very good. Authors have continued to pump their lives into the various Stargate offers, and the latest BBC import by Doctor Who is surprisingly good. Even in the various "giant animals" movies on Sci-Fi, the animation seems to be improving all the time. Compare the commodity of this movie to the rather lumpy version in the first big comedy film on Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> But goodness ... what about another plot? Maybe some-different-giant critter? On a whim I started to search the internet. Among the litters I found some interesting stories that could appeal to SF fans and out of work, Russian CGI animators at once. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the rights of the story. (The story contains violent images generally on a par with the various Sci-Fi channel offers). The story has a subplot, ethical and moral comment about the nature of mankind and does not endorse one of them terribly "they really killed all the monsters ?? moments but lets you guess altogether and in a completely different way of thinking. <br /> < What is generally what science fiction should do, no?
