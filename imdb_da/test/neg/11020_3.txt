After watching the TV commercials for this movie, I marched to my local cinema and expect a lot of laughs. Eventually, it was one of the longest 90 mins. I've ever used. Wog Boy really failed to give a story line with enough substance to keep my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes not filling that void. One scene where the two 'Wog Boys' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. The only sign worth seeing was 'Nathan', played by Castle Stephen Curry, his battle with the opposite sex giving most of the few laughs. One word for this flic is boring. Save yourself time and just watch TV commercials as the only laugh on it.
