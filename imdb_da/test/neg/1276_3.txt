If you are a child who likes adventure "real life" adventure, see it. If you are a youth smiling kids movie, why not see it? :) If you are a parent to watch a movie with your children, you are better off choosing squirrels! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this movie was a bit of fun and set things in good stead for happenings to take place. But after the kind of fun introduction of characters, settings, and potential conflicts, the story turned out to be rather boring. When almost or less the same thing happens in the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" repeatedly comes to mind like parts of a dumped LP or the commercials you really hate. And the culmination of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
