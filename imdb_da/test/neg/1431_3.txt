It starts quite well (and quite disturbing) quickly sinking into an annoying mess. Dee Snider (by Twisted Sister infamy) apparently showed the manuscript from his own idea, and while the idea of ​​a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, poor dialogue and one of the biggest non-endings you will ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a really scary first reel. This really looks like it will be a good low budget effort. <br /> <br /> No such luck. The plot goes all over the card, and Snider's character tirelessly speculates tiring psychotic fortune-cookie lines that must pass for meaningful dialogue. The worse is that the support aid only records, and the only half-way credible dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigates the internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a good idea. Oh, and there is a new twisted sister song if you don't care.
