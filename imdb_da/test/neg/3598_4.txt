When I heard that they were doing this, I was said to be happy considering the first movie that was pretty good if a little on the short side. <br /> <br /> But then I remembered some of the disasters in the Disney sequel I've seen before (I'm looking at you little mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Whatever I saw and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best part is the animation is fantastic. It really has the special Polish that the "real" Disney movies have. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the rest is disappointing. The story is serious everywhere. For a moment it's about something, so completely changes to a different story and then changes to another completely different story. It reminded me how the Family Guy movie was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I laughed at once. Kronk was a lot of fun in the original movie, but in this he is just not fun. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie unless someone lends it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
