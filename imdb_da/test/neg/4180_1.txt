This should be one of the times you come across a movie with a nice cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. Ok my impression (I had seen scarecrow on the TV weeks ago) perfect, a nice slasher movie to start the evening with. ................... wrong, totally wrong I think 5 minutes in I would take it out, but I thought I wasted 3 $ on this so I will finish it where scarecrow well i guess it on the fisherman's legs with strong rain boots. You see it so often. I looked at this thinking .... OK when should these brats run into this guy, at one point I thought they died. but no .... I mean frig, their still alive. I only chuckled a few because of how badly they were staged. one was zooming in part at the start. The director / actor / writer says, "Remember I had the feeling I have it again" and it was either a zoom in or zoom out to hell, I look back. but I suppose the scene seemed shocking, I mean, what more shocking is that his wife had the same shocked look .... OK ... she believed in him ??? I'm sorry, but YEAH .... I didn't know he was psychic until I read the movie box to get some sense of what I experienced. Not only that, they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear. <br /> <br /> The other things that made me laugh a little were screaming in the camera to make it scary ....... OK ........... .. .. filming a girl close to screaming into the camera for 5 minutes ....... right ..... I laugh the reason for how pathetic it was these kids cannot function as the rest of the people in the movie. <br /> The top thing from scythe should have been lost or something .... because the evil guy just had a stick. not even an ax, someone should ax the pond production film <br /> <br /> Don't fall into the picture, this movie is a piece of sh * t. I saw the trailer and guess what it has <br /> <br /> GIRLS where you talk to me and horn
