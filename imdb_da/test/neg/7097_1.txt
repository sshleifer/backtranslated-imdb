This is an entertaining flick. I suggest you rent it, buy a few quartz rooms, and invite the entire crew to it. My favorite parts were. The war movies that were so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous. The wonderful special effects .3. The Academy Award winning play and .4. The fact that every gangsta in the movie seemed to make a bad "Scarface" imitation. I mean, Master P as a Cuban educator! This is a groundbreaking area. And with well-written dialogue, including lines like "the only difference between you and me Rico, I'm alive and your death", this movie is truly a masterpiece. Yeah right.
