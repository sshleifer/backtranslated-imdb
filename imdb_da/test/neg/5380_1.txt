Why???? What a disgusting joke of a supposed movie ... from the poster it looked like a sweet movie .. what a disappointment ... who the heck is the male leader? He looks like an old delayed retirement policy ... I'm a policeman and I can tell .. The man can't act ... go back to being a policeman ... not on the screen. Why did they show his bare ass as if he was meal gibson, hell no ... put the filmmaker out of operation .. this guy has no business in making a movie ... I seriously doubt that women or gay men find him attractive ... anyone who threw the movie is not a talent raise who doesn't throw any talents in the lead. It's nice that we white guys get the Asian women anyway, but why a nasty white guy, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as the white boyfriend .. why Asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what I see ??? Don't get it .. should be low self-esteem .. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl to shop in the movie was Kate Holliday .. why was there a hot white chick among the rest of the ugly Asian chickens who think they are hot and can shop ??? Only two actors in this movie, Poetry's host at the end of the movie and one hot white chick in the massage house .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the leaders in the movie. <br /> <br /> Asia Character was ridiculous, looked like she was trying too hard to be a kind of ghetto / sexy black girl ... keywords here are "trying" .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. you can't act and you are not warm enough physically for this kind of role. You have to play character roles and be more humble in your own presentation .. I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I looked her up at IMDb and she is a great Asian actress ???? If so, I will not see what the bad Asian actresses are. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood doesn't have Asian American actors !!! if this is the best they got !!! they would probably win some kind of Asian movie prize ?? give me a break ... it looked like they just made a movie to put a bunch of Asian girls in them .. they are not even hot .. Gina ... you are not hot .. stop trying .. play character roles and improve your acting .. you are not a leading female type ... If this movie makes money, the pigs can fly ..sorry to be so blunt, but I feel these actors / actresses have to either better or work on their craft: with the exception of the two actors, I mentioned who should have played the leaders. I say this in love with all the Asian lead girls in the movie, please do what your parents say and go and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and do the shopping on the site for fun..that is what you are doing now .. I am not trying to be but but hope that this will be read and pushes you people to either improve or do another business. There was not even a message ethically in this movie .. I would not be surprised if the "Soap Girls" were secretly funded by members of the Ku Klux Kl a special section of the clan's Asian American hate propaganda <br /> <br />. Otherwise, Asian people must hate themselves. Seeing this movie makes me, as the viewer, grateful that I'm not Asian .. you're pathetic. .have some self respecting you Asian people.
