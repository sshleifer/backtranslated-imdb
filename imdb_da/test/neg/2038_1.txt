Brilliant plays, excellent plot, amazing special effects! This is what I would say about this movie if I had seen it with a bag of diarrhea on my head for the whole movie. Instead, I endured a 2 hour crap-o-rama. Our "brilliant" story begins with some billionaires who have nothing better to do than to look in volcanoes in vain to find his lucky charm. Instead, he finds a 5'4 "man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur outfit and some queer hollow folk. <br /> <br /> In his endless wisdom (along with his infinitely large nose) he decides to enter this volcano with a team of "special" people. To travel to this underground country, they go by plane? No. Boat? No. They use this giant soup with a "solid metal" drill on the end I swear, so I guards In summary, this movie was flatter than .... Oh that's right! This was the most beautiful movie I've seen! For those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a Sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie , I warn you! If you see this movie, you should be ready to cut some fate of your crew and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The rating system allows only a minimum of 1/10 I give this a -10/10!
