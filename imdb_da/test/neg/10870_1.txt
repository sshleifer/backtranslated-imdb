This movie is so bad, it's funny. I saw Hell Ride half-thought it was a comedy, although I couldn't quite work out if they actually took p * ss or if it really was a serious attempt to do something decent. I notice that it is not listed here as a comedy, so they must be serious! It seems to be about a gang of retirees driving around on motorcycles, shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilarious bad dialogue you can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two characters that smash bottles over each other's heads and show each other 'get out of prison-free' cards that they have made! Also check out Vinnie Jones' accent, where in the hell should he be from?!? Oh, and there are also a lot of naked girls in it who for some indispensable reason seem to have nothing more than having no stop sex with these leathery shiny b * stards! The guy who wrote and instructed it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000 beard and an orange tan sunglasses - has for some reason been in the lead, perhaps it is part of the joke, I don't know. In fact, the more I think about it the more I'm sure this movie is a p * ss take. It is produced by Quentin Tarantino, and it is possible he has released it in humor as a little laugh. It is a total rip off of Tarantino style but just really made really bad. It is, however, very fun, and I somehow believe that it can go down like a cult classic, either from being a fun parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style or something that is very unintentionally fun. Must be seen to be believed.
