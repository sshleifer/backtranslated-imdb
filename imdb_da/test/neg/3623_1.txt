This is a children's television series about a Mary-Sue who is simultaneously, mediocre and bitchy. I couldn't bring myself to sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can't act to save her life! What message does this show bring to children? If you're not perfect as Zoey, you're unworthy of * rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It is absurd how Zoey's character is exactly the kind of person who would be despised in real life, but she manages to become so popular. Then there is Chase who is basically a loving puppy who cultivates the soil Zoey goes on. Then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down to stop them from shedding Zoey. I'm sorry, but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.
