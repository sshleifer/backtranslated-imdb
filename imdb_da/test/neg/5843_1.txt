This was one of the biggest crap pieces I have ever had to see. I mean seriously. How would anyone else notice if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife was even considering it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. After all, she was the one who talked about it in bed and said how good it would be for them to build his house or whatever with that money. Woody never fully agreed before she spoke to him. How can you trust her? Who in hell would actually consider if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he flips out at her. Apparently he did not have the right to distrust her, except the fact that his wife just slept with another guy who is extremely rich and beautiful. Oh, wait, then he should apologize HERE after she's filed for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. Of course, Woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her, especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. So at the end of the movie, she is apparently in love with Woody still and misses him so much that she would not leave Hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid stories to try to suggest her leaving, and her bleeding roof Hobbs ???? Are you asking me? Was she under contract as her sex slave or something? I mean what bleached ?? Oh and wait it gets better. She blows kissing him passionately before she gets out of the car. Yes, she's not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go with you one last time for good ole's sake. Smooch smooch, smooch even though I'm still married to a guy, I left a rich guy. I have never seen such a piece of shit in my life. How in hell should we feel good after the terrible ending? What should this movie represent? Nothing came out of this! This was the most meaningless movie I've ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody, I would tell her they should drown in the water source they were near. Apparently, he had no self-respect. What the hell was Roy Hobb's thinking by taking this awful role. I want to puk after seeing this. This movie was so bad it was seriously ridiculous. I want the two hours in my life back that I wasted seeing this piece ****.
