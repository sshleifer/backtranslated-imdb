On his recent maligned reality show, Mr. Shore admitted his cinematic oeuvre is best enjoyed rocky. No, he must have said "best seen". While a healthy toke can see you through the final credits, there is little pleasure to find, save some occasional chuckling on the picture, not with it. Titular hyphenation is the smallest complaint. Second hyphen, healthy Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (I dare to rub out that "Purity of Bell" patina of purity) is miscast as a rural vamp; she is too round of face to betrayal. Mr. Shore, even occasionally showing the odd talent for imitation (I thought I recognized a Jimmy Stewart in there), but it is never appropriately used. The triple fish-out-of-water formula has not yet been reproduced with less grace. Our heroes, Crawl, have valuable little jokes to account for quickly charming his agricultural antagonists. In the end, I had to announce it has been found: THE WORST MOVIE EVER. P. S. Like another fish, Adam Sandler went better with "Mr. Deeds." It can take a Shore to appreciate a Sandler.
