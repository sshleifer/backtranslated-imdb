Three businessmen are involved in a fight with three mysterious men. The three businessmen take revenge, escalating to a murder after another. Probably the story is about the violence that could occur in ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The ground has too many holes. The details were ignored to move the story forward. The action was uneven. The color balance was horrible even though I saw this movie in DVD. The small budget and tight schedule were clear. It all seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight, and the end was just incredible.
