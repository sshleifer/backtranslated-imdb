This movie would receive a much higher voice from me in general, and I will talk about why, but above all, it gets four stars and should stay on four stars because of the directors' ridiculously tasteless depiction of rape and sexual assault. Not far into the film, Oyama sexually violates a woman he has saved earlier, and while she briefly becomes miffed by her actions, this attitude only holds about. five minutes before loving worship enters and carries its character through the rest of the film. I know many will argue that it is not so important in a kung fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genus I cannot say that it is so unusual, but it does not prevent it from being completely tasteless every time I see it. However, what I want to say in this film's defense is that it is a bit refreshing to see martial arts or even action movies of any kind that do not really give anyone the viewer to come back Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and killer; a societal exhaust, whose only pupil becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being shot down by the police. The last pictures of the film leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he has previously assaulted to love him and then followed him with the whale puppy as a devotion. <Br /> <br /> Whether this was really the intended message of the movie or not, one cannot help but feel a little hope that Oyama may be on the verge of suicide when the movie is over. This is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a movie that gives you the feeling that its violence should not be celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two people involved or by letting it all together, it would have been a much more interesting movie.
