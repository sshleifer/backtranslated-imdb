I did not know that this movie was produced by "WWE". Wrestling is lame enough. Why should they land their name further by making a movie as crazy as one was ?? I found it to be a complete disappointment. If I had known this movie would be as stupid as it was, I would have been at home and doing something more entertaining. Sure, I'll give them credit for the cool effects; but the killer did not seem as scary as he could have been. He lacked a number of things. But I will let you point them out to yourself. The reason was a good idea, could just have been done in a much better way. Maybe WWE will continue to hold on to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry.
