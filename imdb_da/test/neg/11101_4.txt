After putting a mummy in a local museum going through cat scan, a metal object in its brain reacts negatively to the procedure, releasing the spirit or phantom, if you like, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to practical circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum, finds herself in possession of the evil spirit. Soon she steals the museum's Egyptian treasures under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> This is a service bar enough if you haven't seen any other incarnations of "Belph√©gor" before. If you have it, I recommend skipping this version as it cannot help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery. It plays out like a (slightly) higher budgeted Sci-Fi Original movie, and I don't really mean it as a compliment.
