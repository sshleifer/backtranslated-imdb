Tempest is based on the classic Shakespeare work of the same name, but has little resemblance to its source material. It masks as being as cerebral as its namesake, but instead it is a jumbled, convoluted and hackneyed exercise in the tedium. The original investigated the premise that people have a bad side that would be destructive if it was not marked. Here you only get an uninteresting mid-life crisis (gabbe) goofball that has everything wrong in his personal and professional life. He is endowed with a supernatural force that he uses to try to control his environment in other words: to get his own way. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong, he finds a secluded place and begins to babble "Show me the magic!" while waving his hands around and making a "serious concentration" expression. From the way these scenes are shot, it seems he is trying to bugs into other kinds of bugs. Turn a spider into a cockroach, maybe, but at that time you really don't care. The story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a Greek island somewhere, so it has an awkward relationship with some girls he meets, one of the stupid romances ever committed to filming. The story just goes down and moves slower and slower. You never get any reason to like or dislike anyone. <br /> <br /> I give this a 2 because of the beautiful Greek placement pictures and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it is not clear whether the storm power brought this ending or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been much improved in other films; One notable example is the "Forbidden Planet", which gave credibility to how power becomes out of control. <br /> <br /> With regard to this "Tempest", its only magic is to cure insomnia.
