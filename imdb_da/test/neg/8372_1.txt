This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover corresponds to the scroll text at the beginning of the movie. The further plot was zero, and even a bunch of bodies would have shown more life in their "acting". I considered the full length and was really relieved when the death of the final sign signaled the end of my suffering! The location was either a kind of vaults or a grimy beach. I assume that home video equipment worked as a camera and the lighting was below standard. The dialogues were uninspired and meaningless. As the actors face. Which brings me to the topic "make-up": By the look of it they got it as gimmicks in some teenage magazines "my first own make-up" or the like. What made me buy DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with this brilliant work was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was mistakenly translated as "Lysbog". The 4.70 EURO I paid for this DVD was a complete loss because the DVD entered the recycling box without further ado.
