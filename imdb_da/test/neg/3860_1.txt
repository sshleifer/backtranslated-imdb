Just looked at this to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I hadn't bothered he can and has since done much better than this crap. Can't understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity fun, but separately; It's an absolute mess and not fun at least. No waiting, only one line was fun, where Mr Kent (Joe) and his family have dinner with this nut job as he has been invited to dinner (Lord alone knows why). Pests for Mr Kent: You know what it is like dog you have been there Ms. Kent: Not recently, Joe's expression was fun, but that's what a line doesn't make a good comedy and this tat is so far away from To be fun, it should be sent to the nearest trash, that's just good enough for it. Joe Morton - Happy to see you, you're no longer staying in waste you are much better off and a great big actor.
