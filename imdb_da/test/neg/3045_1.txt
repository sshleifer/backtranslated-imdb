What should have been a routine baby sitting in a remote seashore turns into a night of terror, as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker as he tries to move one step ahead of him. br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie was pretty good, but it was all downhill from there. Remake takes the first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80-minute feature film. It's a good idea because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. But if they wanted this movie to work more efficiently, they should have employed a better lead actress, better director, writer, etc. There is no excitement, everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very boring movie as there is not much. At least there is not much to sit through since it is less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise was to work, then the lead actress should give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen, and throughout the film she liked to read her lines. You get a starring role in a Hollywood movie that will be seen by millions of people and you will not make any effort at all! Why did they hire this girl? Sure, she's beautiful, but she can't act at all, but I guess it doesn't matter to the target audience that is likely to eat this movie. The rest of the casting is bland and unforgettable, especially the woman who plays the girl, Rosa. Even the stranger was paralyzed and his lines on the phone were not at all effective. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of last year's disappointing horror movie Boogeyman. The movie was a bunch of cheap scares and fake alarms, and when a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill goes into a room because she hears a noise, but it's just a false alarm like a cat or girl. This type of scene happens again and again until finally after approx. 50 minutes the stranger appears. He must be one of the lame murderers ever. He wore no weapons and did not seem to pose a major threat. The end is bad, but it fits the rest of the movie so it doesn't matter much. The movie is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building excitement. He used all the clich√©s he could think of, and the results were not very good. The house was great and I want to give the movie credit for it. It was an isolated house so it was pretty scary, but it's about the only good thing this movie has to offer. Finally, if you are not a teenage girl, skip the movie. Rating 2/10
