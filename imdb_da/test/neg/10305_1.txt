The first season was great - good mix of job and brother and friends at home. It was actually a beautiful fun show. Now it turns out again, and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone - and it's all about the airline. Even the old man who runs the business has gone downhill - too over the top, where before it was perfect. <br /> <br /> It and no more Sarah Mason - one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show. You can almost see the meeting "the old one is fun, let's focus on him, make him go over the top and do everything about the airline .. it becomes a nutty version of the office!" In any case, no hot chicks, no clock.
