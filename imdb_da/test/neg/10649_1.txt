Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Bloodline Starring: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: This follows a timeline of the acquisition of Merchant bloodline, which started with Phillip L'Merchant, who created the box that opens the door to hell. Beginning with the 18th Century to present time when Pinhead first meets the merchant and tries to separate the bloodline .. (he is the only one who can stop Pinhead, you see) and finally in the future in the room where Paul Merchant finally figured out how to send Pinhead to hell for good. Openers: This is a movie hated so much by the people who did it, they stated that fictional director Alan Smithee would be the credited director. They only pull Smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a horrible movie, such as classics like The Birds II: The End of the Country or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I didn't do that. How did I like it? You read this so I'm sure it's what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The Good: This movie isn't as bad as you've got to believe. Oh I don't go on sugarcane it. This movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it has some positive things. Cooler cenobits this time to starters, like twins and demon Angelique. Pinhead still has a leading role and still has good lines ("Pain has a face, let me show it to you"), and it's a bit entertaining all the way through. Gorehounds will love the movie because of the endless supply. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you will have to look hard to see it. The Chatterer Dog is amazing. <br /> <br /> The bad: But for a story about Hell vs the damned Merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held with duct tape. Nothing was really explored to its full potential and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnapter a child and hold him ransom! Random deaths just for having more blood (not always a bad thing but not for the sake of history). Pinhead is at his worst here, he ranks and races and ranks even when he is dying! For the very wise demon he used to be, at best he has been reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain. If Hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back to a cameo role, then that's the way. Bloodline destroyed it for all of us. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin ripping, drilling, hooks, impaling, beheading and more treats. The Chatterer Dog, while stunning, series of bad special effects during chase scenes. Final Rating: This movie had the potential for something great, even Hellbound levels of grandeur. But all that was wasted. Who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: This movie is the worst of the Hellraiser series. Only for finishers. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
