I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed. <br /> <br /> The only area in the movie I enjoyed was the commentary on film making. For the most part, this movie seemed random and amazing (I don't say it in a free way, though) and just stupid. It was as if he mixed imagination with everyday life, which might sound exciting in some movies, but the imagination just seemed unnecessarily perverted. My criticism of this movie is not on the actors, rather the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but considering that it was a film festival, it was not happening.
