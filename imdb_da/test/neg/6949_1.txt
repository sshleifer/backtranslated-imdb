Horrible, a waste of time. There is no camp or waste value in this. See better amateur movies performed by 10 to 12 year olds in movie clubs. Where on earth can you spoil movies about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It is not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiasts in the same room and just shoot it. <br /> <br /> Couldn't find anything good about the movie. There was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. A couple of overweight goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Now, the cemetery was nice, but one should shoot a vampire movie in the dark. <br /> <br /> The purpose was probably good: create a rubbish game in the Ed Woods spirit. The problem is that you can't make a bad movie on purpose. It requires talent and an attempt to make a "real" movie. Ed Wood could have lacked money but he certainly had the effort. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius in relation to these guys.
