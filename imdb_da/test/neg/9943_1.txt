I've seen hundreds of kung fu movies and I've heard something good about this movie so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst screens of film making I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't help feeling that the director will have every muscle guy in Hong Kong in this movie. Everyone goes to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had some courtesy. This movie has only half-developed men screaming in every scene and stupid women who have no self-respect. The narrator's character should have been killed to suck so much ... she really deserved not to live to the end. The whole movie was a melodramatic mess, with horrible acting, poor conducting and bad action. They should just rename this movie to 'The Dumb One-Armed Caveman with a Blade'. Here's a question ... why do some instructors use quick cuts for some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors. each scene was close up and quickly cut without any flow. The movie tried so hard to show intensity, but it became almost ridiculous. Stay away from this movie, you have any taste in kung-fu movies ... or any taste in movies.
