I bought this DVD for my young son who loves the ToyStory movies. I never expected to be in the same league as the Toystory movies, but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon, well below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is unoriginal, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is below par, even the buzz is not that great. The movie could have been so much better. I especially hated painting by the story's storyline. I know it's meant for kids, but even kids know when something stinks to this level of lameness. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoy some aspects of the movie, I really liked the opening part of the movie with the slag mutant monster, it just went downhill from there.
