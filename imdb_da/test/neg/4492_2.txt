May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent trailer park or perhaps 'Compton' LA White Kid witnesses a terrible childhood tragedy related to drugs and violence. An unprofessional but dedicated policeman is trying to shut down a "sophisticated" high end club drug ring just to be fired and chewed out of the drug crew high-priced lawyers. The ground thickens as more people come back to seek revenge and justice with a predictable ending. The only memorable part was a walk-on by Ron Jeremy. <br /> <br /> If I was in a movie theater, I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry about the poor actors in this movie. It was just awful and painful to see. The worst part was the cinematography, where the director was flashing back within the same scene, so the sound did not match completely. And no it was not a codec or DVD problem, but a deliberate technique. Ughh. Two stars.
