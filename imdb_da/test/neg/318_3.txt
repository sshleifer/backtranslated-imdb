My mother and I rented this gem some years ago while visiting here for Thanksgiving. I rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low budget horror movie with stupid special effects, a worse plot and even worse acting. But do you really expect a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I did not believe. <br /> <br /> Since this movie has some entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
