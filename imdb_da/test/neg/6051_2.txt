I really thought it would be a good movie, boy ... was I wrong! For a fast summer-ready: B-class acting C-class special effects D class for the overall movie. Don't make me wrong, the story was pretty good and not kiddish, so an adult also runs with it, "the deer" looks good so most women will like it :-), not a total chick flick, as it contains some combat scenes and some blood <br /> <br /> but the way it's shot ... awful <br /> <br /> the special effects -> would be better suited to tv-> on a kids show < br /> <br /> and finally ... send some of the actors back to acting if they ever attended a class there. <br /> <br /> Believe me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours. /> <br /> You have been warned.
