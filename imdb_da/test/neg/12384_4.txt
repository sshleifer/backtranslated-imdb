Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while the test is flying a plane - but nothing arises on radar. Then aircraft and ships begin to disappear and report a UFO rise. It turns out it's a huge monster bird that attacks and kills. But what is it and why is this? <br /> <br /> This has all the right elements for a classic. It has a really nice entertaining script - I never got bored. The action is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Mother does not exaggerate the macho hero, and Mara Corday is quite good as the necessary female love interest. She is also strong and takes care of herself - even though she is out to get food and coffee for everyone under the film. The problem here is the monster. Dear God - It's terrible! It looks like a fake turkey! It has a long neck, a hilarious silly BEAK, some teeth, a few hair strands on the head and the claws. And - oh yes - it squawks! Not roaring - squawking! The actors had no idea what it looked like - it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theater. Mom said his audience broke out and laughed and he left the theater quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can see the wires also moving it! This only gets 4 stars because Morrow and Corday are so good and the manuscript is well done. It won't be stars for the pathetic monster - wait until you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! Worth to see if you are a horror fan to see what should be the stupid monster ever.
