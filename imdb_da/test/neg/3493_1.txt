This movie is bad. Just bad. In absolute terms, bad. <br /> <br /> The dialogue jumps out of the screen and swallows you in the face with its thoroughly artificial booties, and then defects your ability to detect straight trace elements of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be particularly bad. I live in Angels town, I can prove that. What is so terrible about bigotry in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It creeps on you with a familiar look or a swallow word. Until just at the edge of a full of fist fight, it almost never comes out and says, "Why should he be black!" <br /> <br /> I can see quite clearly that the billiards are black, the detective partner is hanspanic, DA is white. As long as there are movies rolling through the projector, I can let visuals, music and words take me to that conclusion without telling me the conclusion. Draw emote and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a partnership and trust between the film maker and the audience. This trust is raped by this movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie pulls you in the direction of an audience and it steers you with signals to drive to a point. This movie settles down with its point and offends you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is, why did we as a community say collectively, "thank you?"
