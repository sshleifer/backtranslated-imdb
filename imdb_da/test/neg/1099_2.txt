This begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A bunch of children are killed in a mine clearance intentionally cut off by the mine's owner. Cut to 2006. Recently widow Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a distant house located near that mine. What they do not know is the ghosts of the toddlers haunting the forest and killing anyone who is around for darkness. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring horror movie. The principle is obvious and has already been killed. There are also big gaps in the logic of history. It is never clear why these children just kill someone or why they eat the organs afterwards (yes - it is shown). They are already dead - why do they need food? And why haven't they got the biggest villain in history long before? He was around the area. Why choose this time to attack him? Also the signs are not least similar. Sarah comes across the worst. It has a few sparse graces. The location is beautiful and creepy at the same time, some of the killings were very bloody and brutal and the kids even looked scary quiet walking through the woods at night. But all in all, I was bored and struggled to keep myself awake. You can skip this one.
