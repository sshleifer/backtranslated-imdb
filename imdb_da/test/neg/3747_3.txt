Sorry, I usually love French thrillers - eg. Chabrol - but this was a glossy shambolic root. The fact that it was based on a Harlan Cohen book tells, because instead of being a French movie (strong in psychology and character), it is more like a John Grisham-esquire roller coaster ride with numbers with ridiculous plot twists, flashbacks to update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm, he's the bad guy!') and set of mysterious stereotypical characters that seem to reside different movies. In the end, I laughed hysterically at the bumps in the movie's tone (the scenes where the main character is helped by two street-colored shady characters, are inadvertently fun), the completely confusing plot, the absurd coincidence, and happiness of happiness (eg guessing the password for an email account ) AND yawns uncontrollably (thought I should have misled 1hr 50min driving time as it seemed to pull for 3 hours 50 minutes).
