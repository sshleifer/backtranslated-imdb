The core issues at stake (God and Satan / Good and Evil) can be and should be hugely convincing (as demonstrated by thousands of works of art / music / literature / film). Unfortunately, the end of days is nothing more than a 2-dimensional cartoon. Byrne's performance is so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further emphasized by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The single convincing scene occurs initially with the transformation of Gabriel Byrne's character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotic and repulsive - the modernization of the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.
