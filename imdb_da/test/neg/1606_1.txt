The fear of this made for television films was that it did not end with this. It created a regular weekly series that was even worse than pilot / movie. Most movies about different professions have some kind of realism for them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting. This had none of it. If the intention was to make it in "Camp", it succeeded. It resurfaced on cable a few years ago and failed again. Richard Jaeckel's performance as the chief executive who does everything was the only redeeming part of this movie. Campier than the Batman series in the 60s.
