The previews were so fun I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I just got home and I have to say I couldn't have been more embarrassed about this movie. Yes, there were times when the jokes were funny, but the stereotypical roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a fine actress, but the scene of "spiritual" was just in bad taste. It was unnecessary to say that the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd (I was one of a very small handful of blacks).
