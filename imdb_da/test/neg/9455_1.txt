Bought for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Wood-like, lame effects and a horrible story set to be a movie you have no need to see for yourself. PV is one of those movies that doesn't even have the good grace to be bad in a fun way, but instead this bile seems to make itself so offensive boring, stupid and crazy as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control. A former lab trainer is standing with a nurse to try to stop him. Someone should have stopped the creators of this nonsense. No one has any reason to watch this movie, and I am actually appalled at humanity on the grounds that at the time of writing, 2 people were given cruelty 10 out of 10.
