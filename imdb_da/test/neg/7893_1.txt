I want to be honest - the pimped purple plane with Snoop Dogg at the helm is a fun visual gag. It would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial, or perhaps a 3 minute music video. But the producers have committed the ancient concept of comedy to stretch 30 seconds of material in an hour and a half, and the results are predictably lame. The rest of the 89 minutes is filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and speed jokes, offensive and - worst of all - painfully unfunny. The narrow plot screams under the weight of its contrivances. Best to avoid unless you are full or rocky.
