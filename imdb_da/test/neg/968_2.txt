I don't understand jokes. I think this is my problem with modern cinema, or the movies made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will be the next biggest sensation. Isn't it strange? People don't laugh much more and I think one of the diseases for this problem is the movie "Showtime". There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the enchantment between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as eye-eye, with regular standard cliches that made the general population dwindle with preprogrammed laughter that was nothing in this movie that made me laugh. There wasn't the indulgent physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a movie. From the beginning, I didn't buy the match between De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement. Throughout the commentary, does the director talk about living around the cocktails and laughter that happens during the shooting? where was it in the movie? This falls to either two problems ?? The director really has no sense of comedy, or the editor did not understand the value of the movie. Whatever they both judged the whole hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime". Outside of finding any reason to laugh, there was no need to follow these signs through any moment of film. There was a glimpse of humor with De Nisi's desire to capture ceramics as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine, so the audience would understand who does it?), But it was lost and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside one open monologue, no one would have understood it. He rents a room in a manufacturer's house where he can afford a policeman's salary? This didn't even calculate Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed and was there no true test of weaponry either? even at the end. It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. Where was the TV show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at first, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this movie outside of further questions and meaningless dribbling. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten again. The director and the producer laughed at this while we, the skinny viewer, may suffer through internal jokes and cliché stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was there a loving interest in this movie? Was there a really scary bad guy who went apart from the comic duo to bring true harm to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that did not come back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this movie? If you need the answers to these, you will of course not find them in "Showtime". The fact that I am speaking this review with the question of the question merely means that this sub-pair (actually far below sub-sub-subpar) did not fill any quota or resemble anything of value to the cinematic world. Sure, it had big names and a really nice explosion, but there was no content at all. It was almost as if the director said before the slider that he wanted clichés, but not regular cliches ?? Go with the bad ones. The reason had no linear structure. The wit was boring. The signs were dull and underdeveloped. This goes beyond even the best of "mate-cop" films. I like to give the film the benefits of the doubt, but nothing worked in this movie. Not even Shatner could save this movie and he even tried hard. Overall, I also cannot suggest this movie to anyone with a pulse. The comment only confirms the film's pathetic character with obvious errors, horrid jokes and creators who question their work. If creators cannot stand behind "Showtime", why should we? I didn't want a "deadly weapon" when I saw this, but I wanted something like that. I understand that there was some kind of criticism of "reality TV" and the corrupt character of the media, but that message didn't get it from the page. In fact, I think I saw "media" leaving the theater first when I saw this. Shame carries his heavy hand with this movie, and I can't blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. Of course, De Niro wants to get away from a picture that mocks him, but making these kind of movies will only put him back. One of these films is equal to a Scorsese image. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. I promise it will make your last movie day worth it. Oh, and if you laughed at some of the jokes in this movie ?? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Degree: * out of *****
