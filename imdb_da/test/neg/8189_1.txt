This person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity and falsification to make others believe he has talent. I have often seen comics use a bit of each with effect, but when all you can say is twisted with it, it is a sign of a drug afflicted with distorted mind. Make me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be for a few years of abuse. Poor man!!! I admit I couldn't see it all - too stupid for words. The amazing part of this is that someone actually thinks he's a philosopher !!! No wonder self-respect and decency are dwindling, and perversity is rising. Could it be that the UFC might have been a factor in his deadened brain?
