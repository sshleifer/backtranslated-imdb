This is my first "terrible" rating ever on IMDb, and I couldn't think of a more deserved movie to honor it. I was hoping for entertaining waste and finding waste of the most horrible, stupid kind. I found a movie that no one might have suffered a bit, including his creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", directed, written by and starring Larry "QT's Friend" bishop, has a simple plot on a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two cyclists and a cruel murder in 1976, which has not yet been claimed. Larry is determined not to tell this story and instead focuses on putting his swaying, weirdly grim character in situations where he can cuddle women who pretend to like it. He also has a dialogue that contains enough horrible firecrackers / metaphors to even put the word "fire" to life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not fortunate. Sometimes they hit their bikes, making one feel even more upset by Michael Madsen, as his high handle seems to add insult to injury to appear in this movie. There are lots of silicon-enhanced nudity, but rather little action and no humor whatsoever, so one wonders what kind of audience they had in mind. My guess is that most people who watch this movie, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and visit the right things instead.
