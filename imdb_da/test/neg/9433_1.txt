Meet Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a ghastly young bookie content with its boring life-threatening figures for the mob and living in a basement cellar apartment at a senior center. His only recreation sees television and occasionally stubbornly with his splendid prostitute pal, Honey (Janeane Garofalo). But one day, all this changes when the mob is killed, and the reputable Cosmo is chosen by the smooth and convincing new boss, Gordon (Robert Loggia), to become a full-blown man. It is an offer, the reluctant Cosmo cannot repeat, cannot refuse, and he acts quickly in his everyday lonely existence for a vicious collision course led by veteran mobster Steve (Peter Riegert), a relaxed, suburban war rejoicing the maximum salary of the job and minimum hours. In no time does Cosmo surprise both himself and mentor Steve by showing an absolutely eerie suit for work. Although he has never touched a gun before, Cosmo turns out to be both a warrior and, after an initial wave of moral hesitation, a cool, detached killer. Soon, Cosmo immediately sends wise clients with speed and style, and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as a priceless addition to Gordon's mob. <br /> <br /> Reality gets in the way, however, when one night while being Massager of Honey, Cosmo admits to feeling a little excited, and she recommends that he try to relax. Cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is immediately taken with the friendly and gentle jasmine, which will soon be drawn to Cosmo. Now, if she can just get rid of her annoying girlfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), she and Cosmo can actually start something. Cosmo uses some of the "skills" in his new trade to persuade Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine goes off. <br /> <br /> Writer / director M. Wallace Wolodarksy, a two-time Emmy Award winner for his work on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons", has formed a script merging its three genres love: "I like comedies, gangster movies and romances," Wolodarsky explained, "so I essentially smashed all three to make this movie." But what he's got is a movie so inconsistent and unlikely that it looks like a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live. It is monotonous tone not so much with the stupid sense of humor, which emphasizes the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for Jason Priestly to blithely crush his fancy image, which does not even fully succeed because he plays his character not like a geek, but as a laconic zombie. A geek can be naive, but a geek has passion. Passion for introverted things. But Priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost anti-Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" does not have a sense of scope to actually be anti-Forrest Gump. Peter Riegert (Local Hero, Animal House) has a good performance as usual, and Kimberly Williams does her best with what she needs to work with, but Janeane Garofalo (HBO's Larry Sanders Show) is practically wasted in her role as Cosmos friend. Probably not too long. Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked, and it's just a matter of time before she gets a flabby role, hopefully making a tag with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
