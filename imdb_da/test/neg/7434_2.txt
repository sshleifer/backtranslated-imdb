This * should * have been a great fun movie ... but it falls flat on the face. (In fact, I stopped seeing it halfway through, which is something I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-size motivational speaker who notes an elephant of his father (whom he had supposed to be dead before he was born); He then has a week to get the ponderous pachyderm across the country. His adventures on the road are only mildly fun at best. Janeane Garofalo's significant comic talents are largely untapped. Anita Gillette is impressive in her little role as Jack's mother (who has many explanations to do), and Pat Hingle stands out as a former circus association of Jack's father. - Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first, but I find it hard to believe ...
