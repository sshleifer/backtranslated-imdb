National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Eddie Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. Scandalous direct-to-video flop has oafish cousin Eddie and family on a paid vacation to the South Pacific by his boss, and hopes dunce won't sue his company after being bitten by a smarter labyrinth! Idiotic spin off can not measure up to any of the holiday movies (even European holidays!), With a question about whether the filmmakers thought the script was actually fun. Not even Quaid, Willard or Asner can make it remotely visible. 83 min., Not rated. *
