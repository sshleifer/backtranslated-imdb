All in all, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. Although I'm not total waste, I've found a number of things that might be more useful to spend my time, for example, taking my nails off with sandpaper. <br /> <br /> The actors involved should feel the same as people who are doing herpes medicine advertising; People will not really pay to see either, the infamous you earn will not be the best for you personally, but at least the advertisements will have time. <br /> <br /> The first one was bad, but it gave the word a whole new definition, but it does have a good function: if your kids toss you to let them see R rated movies before you want them to, tie them down and pop this little gem in. See the white stop and the tears begin. ;)
