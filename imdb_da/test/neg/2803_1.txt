Rent this one movie if you're in the mood for laughing (for silly stupidity), as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of kindergartens at a Halloween party! The problem is that there is too much for children, so do not put this in your video recorder for the toddlers. It starts with a small promise that gives you the impression that the boxing artist might actually have started to see this movie before the design of the cover, but then down to epic stupidity. The "killed scarecrows" are clumsy oafs that are as scary as the one in the Oz guide, but not quite as clever. If they only had one brain ...? I got this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / close-out store and yet I feel a bit skinny. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.
