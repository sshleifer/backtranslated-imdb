Everything that made the original so funny seems to be absent here. This is simply a "run of the mill's demons on the loose destructive chaos" slasher, but without the passion that adorned the original. There is nothing new in history, it actually seems that they ignore the first one altogether. Here the demons run loose in a high-security apartment building and of course kill most residents in pig. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time. Although the actors were not brilliant in demons, they in demons 2 are much worse. You don't care about these signs, at all. The reason is non-existent, the music poor (except for a Simon Boswell song), it's not scary at least; It's just not that good. <br /> <br /> The worst movie Dario Argento has also been involved with and Lamberto Bava also (Bava has a como in this movie, not much fun). <br /> <br /> Maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least I could see it all and didn't think about stopping midway. My advice; Stick to the original.
