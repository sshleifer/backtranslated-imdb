See Dick work. <br /> <br /> See Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a good house. <br /> <br /> They have a Latin housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches Spanish to his son. <br /> <br /> The son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See Dick get promoted. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a villain. <Br /> <br /> See Dick take the harvest to the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane stops her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane out of work. <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane turns to crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot unit, they decide to steal the CEO. <br /> <br /> See the robbery get botched. <br /> <br /> See Dick & Jane finance the company's retirement plan with the money from the robbery. <br /> <br /> Yay. See end credits. <br /> <br /> Okay, so you've got the plot. Dick and Jane also care from one scene to the next. A barely connects with the last or the next. It's all terribly episodic in nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey did not disturb bringing his "A" material, he just seems bored and a little shameful about it all. But hi, when you get paid $ 20 million plus, why bother. Te Leoni is hectic. I suppose I would be sorry not to blame for this flop. <br /> <br /> There's just something about Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have a little chemistry. The script is not fun. And it's not well-plotted. <br /> <br /> But it can be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane may be a little too real. Perhaps it's just not fun for people to lose their jobs in an Enron-like situation when reality still lacks a happy ending.
