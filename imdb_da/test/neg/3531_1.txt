I watched this movie at Temple University. I can't imagine anyone ever going to see this movie in a theater (projected on film). The action is similar to Saved By The Bell (The TV Show). The plot is simple and imaginative. The sound recorder likes the sound of the wind, and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, Vampires, Vampires. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
