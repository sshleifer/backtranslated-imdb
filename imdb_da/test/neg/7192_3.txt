Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a wild songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a wild inventor. Both are working on a cigar holder in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie will sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. The lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's girlfriend. When the lake dies, the circumstances gather to make Mary and Newton believe Johnnie is the killer. They put together again to impose Mary in prison. But who really shot the lake? Who is the black widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? The other characters in this scary murder mystery are: The Sea's suspicious wife, a self-sufficient private detective, a seemingly slow guardian (Willie Best), the lake's accountant, a songwriter who thinks the lake is stealing from him and another who believes that everyone is stealing from him. It is up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer. The baby-voiced Wheeler and the cigar-chomping Woolsey beat me as an arbitrary mating, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were fun. <br /> <br /> Not this one. George Stevens, who continued to have a prominent career, directed this gloomy comedy with a dull murderous territory. But two scenes are good, and both have Wheeler and Betty Grable, who sing the excellent "Music in My Heart," written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. For the first time they sing it up a staircase (after which they form back). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts so they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a high-prison prison cell. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through the bars. "The Nitwits" have a few laughs, but the comedy level is best illustrated by Woolsey's line: "Sonny, you have the brain in a 6-year-old boy. And I bet, even though he was happy to get rid of it." is the water down Groucho? Who did not use the redundant "just" when he said it.
