I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And then I have to throw in with the more humble Latt / Howel version. C Thomas Howel had more heart and sympathy to Cruise in the lead (at least in my opinion). Now it is hard to imagine before removing everything in the Spielberg version that costs more than a thousand dollars. There would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no cruise. Because I doubt everything costs more than a cool grand in the David Michael Latt version. So comparing apples with robbers I think I should go with the robbers. At least, the independent film gives a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market.
