At the start of this movie, I doubted that it would be a little more than a typical B sci-fi flick. But as it evolved, I began to get interested, and I saw it all through. The prerequisite is interesting, original, and the purpose is to make a classic. Unfortunately, it ended up with a mediocre movie made from the usual factors that make a potentially good movie a bad movie (bad acting, low budget, etc.). I am interested to see how this would turn out if it was recreated with good actors and a great Hollywood budget.
