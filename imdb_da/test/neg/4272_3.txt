I always try not to be tough while criticizing something that I didn't like, but after seeing this mini-series I was so disappointed that it couldn't help my annoyance. On the one hand, it is true that the series were faithful to the novel and of course I found it very nice, but on the other hand horrible casting, bad actions, especially key people ?? as Funny Price, the impression of stage games, I think theatrical way of acting makes you annoying from the beginning to the end. I'm sure with this budget, although it was low, it could have been done something much better and worthwhile. It is up to you to see this series, but personally I do not advise you to spend your time on this disappointing ecranization.
