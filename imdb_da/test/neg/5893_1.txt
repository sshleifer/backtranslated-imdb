It was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (does not stop the clock for injured players or loss of helmets in Texas football games?) And not so much redemption (so your father beats crap out of you? Well, do something right for once he will love you and make it all worthwhile). <br/> <br /> Either the film of a team and its quest for a championship OR make a movie about a player within a team and his personal fight, but instead, this movie tried to do everything and come up more than a few meters short. The book probably showed the whole story much better; the movie should have picked up an element of history and stuck in it. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from a character dialogue to flash of games and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important - the QB calls its siblings to take care of the mother - what happened to it? Because the mother was coherent at the end of the last game, does that mean she is no longer crazy? Its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack. Buy it and then watch the SportsCenter highlights while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
