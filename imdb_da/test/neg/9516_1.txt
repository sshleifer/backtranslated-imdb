This movie was so frustrating to see. Split screens do not allow you to become very involved in the actor's feelings. I constantly went back and forth to see all those little pictures that I found myself with wiplash at the end. This is basically a rip off of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode" I was very disappointed with these filmmakers trying to be cool. I wish I had gone as many other people did.
