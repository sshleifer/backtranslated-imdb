Subsequently in the classic horror film of the 1970s Carrie with this offer is like Ford after the Mustang with Edsel. This movie was horrible in every detail. It would have been titled Beverly Hill 90210 meets the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both of these shows far exceed this tripe. This movie was hardly a horror movie. I timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minute lame high school hazing and ritual. Wow, what a surprise Carrie's strange friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misconstrues her love interests feelings! Wow, the inhabitants set up Carrie! Wow, jocks have a sexual scoring competition! What this movie needed was a way more action and much less tired teen cliches. This film is completely uncertain.
