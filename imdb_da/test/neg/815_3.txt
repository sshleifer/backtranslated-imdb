It is hard to imagine what they were thinking about when making this film (ie, authors, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a 129-film veteran, throws himself among many other actors with no more motivation than collecting a paycheck. I guess there's nothing wrong with that, but when they're paid, it doesn't mean anyone should see it. <br /> <br /> It is a mistake for me to find good reviews for this movie here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. Comedy? See a Flintstones re-run, about the same plot with less time wasted. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance, for better or worse. And some of the young actors may have had some good experiences from making this movie. But plums ???? It was embarrassing to see his performance, in fact I was positively transfixed to him throughout the movie, knowing that this was the Plummer of Sound of Music fame! I see from his bio that he called the Sound of Music "sound of mucus", so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100s of millions who liked him in it. <br /> <br /> I wonder if today he was asked how do you rate the Sound of Music in relation to where the heart is, what would he say .....? probably something like "where the money is" ....
