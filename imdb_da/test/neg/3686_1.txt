I was in this movie at the Sitges Festival last month. If there was a possibility of "filming" a movie to avoid its existence, this should be the first in the list. María Lidón is not an instructor, she is just a stupid woman pretending to hold a camera with her hand and shouting "action" makes her a professional film producer. What a mistake! The movie itself is meaningless and a total waste of good actors who could do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but places his face in front of the camera. His character is not particularly important in the film. The same can tell about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It's a shame that Rade Serbedzia's character is written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking to himself in the road (now I do this, now I'm low of bats I search in my bag, now I turn to left, now I turn right ...) to give the audience a clear idea of ​​his actions. It is simply nonsense and shows the lack of talent from the director. SPOILERS END <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of waste among the audience was that the title of the film itself brought the guide on the rating everyone should give it: ZERO
