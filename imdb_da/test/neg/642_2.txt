Alien Express is one of the worst movies I find difficult to experience. <br /> <br /> The reason is predictable. Foreigners resemble rubber socks. The effects would have been mediocre in the 70's but are just dreadful by today's standards. Couldn't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model? The action is not good, but really the dialogue is the worst part. It jumps into your mind. "Don't you die on me. Not now." If you ever manage to suspend dissatisfaction long enough to be absorbed into the movie, you will quickly be smashed back to the reality of aliens, model trains or clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this movie a "1", but it doesn't deserve to be judged so badly that some bad suckers can see it for the pleasure of a really bad movie.
