This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the cool idiot blue collar slob with the beautiful (and sometimes shrewish-apparently) wife and crazy in-laws. With this show, the cool unfunny comedian Kevin James is like Doug Hefferman, who works as a shipping driver for a package service. He has a beautiful wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter and grandson's cellar. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drinker, sporting lover, watching television on a sitcom man who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marriage issues. He also has a few idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems associated with this show couple. In addition to the few laughs provided by Jerry Still's crazy old man character, this show was generally unfunny. Kevin James' carefree behavior usually caused the show's problems, which were usually solved by his wife. This show continued a race with sitcoms with the fat stupid father / husband and their beautiful wives, all of whom seemed to run on the ABC for some reason.
