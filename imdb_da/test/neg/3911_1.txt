There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was made or how they made Dennis Hopper star in this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better director than this, and Hopper is a much better actor. The movie is simple stupid. I liked the idea of ​​"square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene with a cyborg, except that, avoid this movie at all costs.
