Shot in my former hometown of a few college kids, this movie centers around some freak by the name "Luther". Luther, recently paroleed (revealed to us by an argumentative parole board in one of the most ridiculous scenes of all time), runs crazy at the local Kroger merchant by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther runs to the farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties an old woman and gets chased and killed. Oh, and the chicken from SUPERBOY TV show gets naked.
