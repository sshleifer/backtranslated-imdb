It would be wrong and reprehensible for me to advise you to see Killjoy 2, you need better things to do, wash the car and throw stones into a stream, but at the same time it is not as near as terrible as you probably think it is. It's almost a decent movie that can handle much more than most direct-to-mud sludge. Killjoy 2 is helped much by Trent Haaga's manic tour as the eponymous clown, he throws himself into the role of such a celebrated surrender that he almost speaks the scales in the favor of the film, but of course it takes more than one man in big shoes. Tammi Sutton gives the most entertaining director cameo since Roger Corman in the Creature of the Haunted Sea, and it is almost ruined by the hasty, sugary end. Everywhere and almost good fun.
