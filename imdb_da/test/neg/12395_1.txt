College students (who are actually late 20s) on campus in Boston (who look strange as the Isle of Man) are threatened by a violent monster (gathered during an episode from Blue Peter). The new teacher must save the day (Although he really is ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I start with positive ... there's a good shot of Eastenders new crazy Samantha Janus can in it mandatory campus shower scene with his best buddy Katy Lawrence. A little side trivia: Katy was hired when she came to audition with her sister, like moral support for her siblings, but ended up landing a lot. Oh, joy. Picked from turmoil to ... blink her pert hams in a meaningless scene added to titillation, then being killed 30 minutes for her troubles. Her latest (and only other credited role) is as Probationary Nurse # 5 in reconciliation. I wonder if she snuck a look at Keira Knightly (whose extras and stars must be mixed) and wondered: where did everything go wrong ?! <br /> <br /> I would like to give a few tips Katy: If all the other British cast members are asked to speak to US accents in a doomed attempt at mass marketing, the only one who can handle it is B- movie veteran USA native Todd Jensen, you know you have problems. If you look at your paycheck and it will only cover your lunch and your bus ride home, you are not starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. If the premiere participates in lots of family members from the fourth assistant director and provokes laughing bulbs when the Stickyback tape monster walks through the sewers, it should dawn on you that this is not exactly Alien. Or even a Critters IV, came to think of it. So Katy, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, you can see), you might be more selective in your choice of debut instead of impulsively jumping into the first pile of crap that leads you. Flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long-lasting success. Unless you are Sylvester Stallone. And he had the script for Rocky to back him up. <br /> <br /> For all purposes, this is like a 0/10 movie I've ever seen. But for pure unintentional grin and pure camp value it becomes a 1. Well done;)
