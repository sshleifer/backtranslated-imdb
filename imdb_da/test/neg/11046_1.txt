Incredible. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen another "Oldboy" because the one I have seen was a badly written, poorly-conceived, over-the-top-acted, sordid piece "Kraapola" who even ignores the ridiculously violent scenes that make it is unsuitable for a child's eyes, could hardly satisfy the imagination and thirst for the plot's consistency for a seven year old. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this dull composition was exhausted in a little bit of wisdom, "Laugh, and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you will be yourself", the kind of boring fortune that says Which great author, being Shakespeare or more to IMDb, Kurosawa, would have thrown into the bin without any other thought. Where this movie should have landed, too, if we didn't live in an era where the cheapest shocking and perversely obnoxious are confused with what was previously called "great art". In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It's not 1 out of 1000 just because of some occasional expert camera work. In no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness, though.
