One reviewer says about those who may not like this movie, "it will only be appreciated by movie guests who are tired of movies as a diversion". I think it is quite unfair for those who find it boring. <br /> <br /> I didn't get tired or disillusioned with movies or with filmmakers, but found this boring and self-satisfied. But then it's true, I'm not too big for deep meaning. I feel that it can be of great importance to them in what you know. <br /> <br /> It's very slow and it takes a long time to try to do its individual points using imagery to do so. But in such days as it looks like a movie like this might be the kind of thing you would encounter in one of the dark and scary cabins in modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular movie theater setting .
