Yes, my overview just tells you all about it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this, try it. But not for pleasure. For studying one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family oriented and "cool" at the same time. The men always believe they know everything, are stupid and finally lose to the magnificent women. Etc .. This is particularly offensive when all the characters are just as horrible and stereotypical. I mean, okay, "Cody" was fun once or another, but unlike other "stupid characters (tm)" like Woody in Cheers or Joey in Friends, he doesn't get good lines. His stupidity is thrown in a "duude" way which becomes quite annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> The family morality is horrible. Everything for the family. Mother and father are senior dictators, who, among serious punishments and old-fashioned parents, constantly say that they "love" their children, and of course, children finally love them * barf *. <br /> <br /> And: There is always a "tender place" as it pushed into "action" where American (c) (tm) morality lessons are forced on viewers, about sex (in fashion you can't Have sex before you are 18 (!!) kind) or drugs. Even church habits are thoroughly described here. The whole concept is direct disease, everything is done half-heartedly to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank out there, unlock them and disintegrate the key. <br /> <br /> So with themes stretching as far as outrageous religious propaganda, I think it is fair to conclude as I did in my topic ...
