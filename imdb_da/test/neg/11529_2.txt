Well, I set out with some friends to watch this movie, we went an hour before the show started to get good seats. So as you can probably imagine where we have come to see this movie :). But this excitement soon turned to horror. This movie is a complete mistake, it's just hard to be fun, it's boring, the script is poorly written and depends on it's hard on the actors to do it ... <br /> <br /> The only thing good ones that work throughout the film were from Stefan C. Schaefer, who was fantastic, the plot was weak, and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, as the main actors are some of Iceland's best comedians. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because it is trying to be hard and never really delivers.
