Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this, because this movie couldn't deliver on any of the hopes that the audience might have entertained, from the imagination of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to simpler desires, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects that freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this movie managed to engage audiences at almost every level. After the first twenty minutes of trying to take it seriously, the public collectively threw his hands and just started enjoying the movie's inherent crappiness. I could be sorry I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I never come back, but on the other hand it was an entertaining two hours, I never come back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
