Time Machine starts in New York in 1899, when Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) suggests his beloved boyfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory), who, unfortunately, just after they are attacked by a jug & Emma shot dead and dies in Alexander's arms . Jump forward 'Four years later' & Alexander has built a time machine that he uses to travel back to the night. Emma was killed to save her, but she's still killed, just another way this time. Alexander realizes what he does, but many times he goes back. Emma will always end up dying somehow, and he longs to know the answer, why he travels far into the future to discover the truth. But after destroying the moon, two new races have developed on earth, the human as Eloi and the monstrous Morlock who eats Eloi. Alexander decides to stick and save Eloi. Directed by Simon Wells, who is actually the great grandson of the author HG Wells, who wrote the original The Time Machine book, where the original The Time Machine (1960) movie was based and it is actually the 1960 movie that producer John Logan's script is based on here instead of Well's original literal source. While all three share the same basic story and ideas, this resumption adds the subplot of Alexander's fiancé Emma being killed, and that is why he finds a time machine instead of just because he is clever and capable. The script is a mix of sci-fi, action adventure and drama, none of which really grabbed me or engaged me so much, of course, there are some beautiful special effects, a few good action scenes and the moment when Alexander's questions are answered as to why he can not saving Emma is actually quite intelligent and makes sense, it never really caught my imagination and I was never really moved by it either. The Time Travel aspects of Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2: Doomsday (1992) in the sense that you cannot change the past, but at the same time the future is not only set. Time Machine is not anywhere near a good movie like Terminator 2: Doomsday. The character is okay, though I thought Guy Pearce was just as young a benign scientist capable of perceiving a time machine, and there is never any real explanation for that mechanics, either as it is a moment , there is no time machine the next he invented and made one & it seems perfect. I think the trilogy feedback offered much more excitement, grin, excitement, and general entertainment value than Time Machine ever does, and while I stop calling it a bad movie, it moves along with a decent pace, one tells reasonable history and have the moment I would not call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book and the original film, both of which are named here. <br /> <br /> The advantage this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects and especially CGI leading to scenes of time that quickly pass Alexander in his time machine, complete with huge buildings being built. new heights, canyons and mountains are formed and a provided pan back that ends up in space when we see passenger rockets around the moon. The effect work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little under par, but in general the effect is good. I saw Time Machine at the telly & the station played the bad pan and scanned it so that the frame's left and right edges were cut off the screen and thus cut off part of the year on Alexander's time machine call, so I actually didn't know what year he went to apparently taken over director Gore Verbinski the last eighteen days with the movie, as Wells suffers from "extreme exhaustion" while IMDb says the time machine itself was the largest and most expensive prop ever built for a movie at the time I find it hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but as a trooper continued. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 80,000,000, the production values ​​are high with a lovingly restored period of New York and good effects work even though astonishing The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best make-up but lost out to Frida (2002). The action is mixed, Jermey Irons puts a good performance in a horrible makeup job that looks him like a rejection of a Lord of the Rings movie, while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big screen debut here and is simply awful, though Guy Pearce is quite good and quite sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Time Machine is not a particularly bad movie or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that can be seen and passed an hour and a half but not much else. Look back to the future (1985) again instead.
