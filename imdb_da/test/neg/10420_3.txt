I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered this as a travesty. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What on earth was Fellini thinking? It is a striking, random, boring piece, with little to recommend it. One should feel frustrated about the lack of backstory or conclusion, but there is only relief that it is over.
