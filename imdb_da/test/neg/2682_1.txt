Okay, wait, let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who think this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone who said it was as good as the original. What makes sense, I don't believe in them, I've seen every Halloween and clearly unlike some people know what at least makes a good scary movie, and this shower of S is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen in my life. Frankly, if I were John Carpenter, I would sue the person who wrote this either or go to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween followers are generally almost all rubbish, two were rubbish, three were stupid, four are okay, five are well five, H20 okay, resurrection painful. But in many ways I find this to be the worst of a very poor group of successors. Why? Well, let me just go into some sort of rant, not so much a review, but a thoughtless rant on why Halloween 6 Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most unpleasant movies I've seen for a very long time. OK, where should I start, ah yes plotted, oh boy plot. Basically, the plot is a stitched together root that contains cultures, signs of Thor and something else. It's just stupid it really is that the film is trying to be flashy and intelligent yet, its framed together in such a horrible way. Why should Michael Myers have reason to kill people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives who would suffice, but no we must have a man in black and mysterious cultures and signs of Thor and complete hug. God is so bad I want to cry really, the authors have tried to add to Myer's character, but have actually managed to do the opposite. Except for wearing a mask and boiler suit <which is a completely different color by the way, Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two, maybe even four. That's another thing, why has Myers been a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was supposed to be the other way around, yet Myers is like Jason, all he does is endlessly killing people in gory ways. In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was much more exciting. Here he just walks around in hacking to death. I mean, within half an hour that we had been lying with the amount of kills in the original, it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head, I think it is big and hes emphasizing. What's more shit, oh well, it's pretty bad to get back to Tommy Jarvis, yes all the characters in this movie are of course crap bar Dr Loomis. I can't stand the little kid, I wish he'd got it, he's really annoying. Our heroin is boring and not interesting. And the whole family is a terrible bunch of actors. Mother is rubbish, brother is bad, and the father I think was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for god's sake, he was actually more evil than Myers. <By the way, his death is one of the most abysmal I have ever seen, I think even Friday the 13th would not come up with anything so ridiculous. What is something else bad? Yes, Tommy Jarvis, doesn't know the name of the guy, but he really can't act, he's trying his best to be serious and all, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he was dead if everyone had died, it would have been quite good indeed. There is Dr. Loomis a horrible age and dies Donald Pleasence of all accounts. Despite being on his last legs, Pleasance is still sharp in the short time he has. It is such a pity that such a cornerstone in this franchise had to say goodbye to waste like this. What is there any other nonsense, after all, where the radio DJ gets it. First, how the hell did Michael get into the van when he was in his house five minutes ago? Secondly, it was just a meaningless killing that can increase body counting, but is just another nonsense, which increases the driving force that is this movie. It is actually the death that said it all to me because it was meaningless much like this movie.
