This movie was very disappointing because several items in the book were erroneously executed. The main story is the same, but there are several errors that have damaged the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles gets hurt at the beginning of the story in a Texas Tech preseason game. That means he won't get anything done during the season, and Chris Comer comes up earlier in the team. <br /> <br /> 2) The fight against Marshall was lost at Marshall. The team depicted as Marshall was actually Midland High one of Permian's greatest rivals, and here is the evidence. Marshall High is Mavericks-colored Scarlet and Silver, Midland High is Bulldog's colored purple and gold. Look at the shirts and you want to see who it is. Also, the real Marshall High's football sister is overwhelmingly black, the team shown was racially mixed as Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Permian only loses to Midland Lee with a point in district play. Midland Lee loses Midland High and Midland High loses his perm. These are the teams that put the coin box as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie returns to the team as a reserve for Chris Comer and after not playing any time in the Midland Lee game, he finishes the team half-time and never stands on the sidelines or goes to any game again. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a tight end and defensive end who wore # 85 not a tight end and strong security. In addition, Boobie # 35 and Ivory Christian wore brought # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) The coaches end up suffering Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lift and runs more straight, playing it way the staff also prefers him. This is partly why Boobie finishes the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium where UT plays in the sub-finals, not the state finals. Carter wins the state's title, but is forced to lose because of an ineligible player. <br /> <br /> The action takes place quite well, but if you read the book, you will see these errors are quite true. I'm also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites out there, complaining about the imagination of the Dallas Carter's football team. The team, according to the book, is as large, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say it's a racist depiction, but reading the book, you see a real portrayal of the team. The story has changed a lot, giving this movie a score of 3.5 / 10.
