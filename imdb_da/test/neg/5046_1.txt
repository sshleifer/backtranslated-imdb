This is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors are trying to push too much drama into a movie that is not dramatic at all. As in the beginning, the part where the monk darted the arrow in his own hand and shot the same arrow in the gargoyle shot five minutes later - no sense at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the plot line is CGI, which would be highly rivaled by a homemade flash movie. The actors look as if they are making their most difficult to portray a bunch of 70 robots; The dialogue makes it so little sensible, it's not fun. Many things HOPPER just without explanation of how or why a woman suddenly walks around a zoo that had shut down a few hours ago. And when she sees this THING flying towards her, she is the first reaction to taking a picture, rather than what she does full ten minutes later --- power-walking (not even running) as her life was dependent on it - It does Of course it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Overall, not recommended. Wishes me to still make new episodes of MST3K.
