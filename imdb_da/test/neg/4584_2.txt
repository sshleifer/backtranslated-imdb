They have taken a story that is dear to the people of Edinburgh's heart, a true story and changed what Hollywood has previously done for many a story. The end result is a movie, but well done for those who do not know the story yet completely different and inaccurate. The original film of this story, which Walt Disney himself monitors, used the right racing dog, which is crucial to this story, and did not mean that John Gray was anything special, he was a poor Shepard who died in poverty at the inn. If you like the story, see the Disney original for a better heart warming story. It's a shame they threw and the potential was there for a fantastic remake of a classic story. Read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story. And if you really like it, visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
