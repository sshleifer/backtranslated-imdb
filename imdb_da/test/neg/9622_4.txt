I try to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid movie viewer and hobbyist movie maker. As I was telling friends during my lunchtime, MirrorMask might be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Like the short Moongirl, the film missed its characters. Several times during the film it made an attempt at humor. It makes you laugh. Instead of making you laugh, you make yourself feel empty. The papers reminded one of the latest Star Wars films. They weren't funny unless you were five. And the play also felt terrible. I have seen actors actually acting in front of a blue screen. And I have believed it. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a formula and tries to apply it with beautiful artwork? And even though the manuscript is completely usable and special effects are quite beautiful, it has no heart and fails. I left the movie to shake my head and considered leaving the theater. I felt sacred and unhappy and still haven't gotten the delicate taste out of my mouth from it. I love independent movies. I encourage people to watch independent movies to support them. But not this movie. This movie should not have been made. At least not so. Why did the director miss the marks so clearly? They were clearly setup ?? Not just humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were poorly timed and delivered. It was as if the film went on three legs instead of four. Its steps are awkward and missed timed. And it could fall over with the slightest push ?? Don't watch this movie. I don't care who you are. It's not worth your time.
