Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and too much money allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than Barbara Cortland's Romanesque novels. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchell's book and the false successor of Alexandra Ripley was written just to get cash for money. Although I always admired the talented talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a truly horrible movie. The scripture is horrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margaret's cameo as Belle Watling is so horrible that I would let her go. <br /> <br /> The only worth in the movie is Sean Bean, who gives a masterful bravura performance like the sexy, crooked villain Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance is in line with "The Man You Love to Hate" and depicts an insecure sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie, so you have to be bothered by watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufficiently boring script. Don't waste your money on this movie unless you're a hard core Sean Bean fan and just watch it for his amazing performance.
