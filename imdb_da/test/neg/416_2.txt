Ron Howard and his "editors" only had one job to do ... Follow the instructions in the book, which was "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and very cinematic in its approach! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They changed everything and I mean everything! What is left is something that is not right to be called "Angels & Daemons"! <br /> <br /> I really love the book and find it very difficult to see that it is being treated like this! <br /> <br /> I wonder what Dan Brown's opinion was for "this" movie. <br /> <br /> I really have no patience to sit down and correct the 1,000,000 changes they've made, it's meaningless .......
