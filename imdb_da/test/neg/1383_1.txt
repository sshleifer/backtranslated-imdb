The tagline for this show is: "He speaks in his mind. We hire extra lawyers." Looking back in time, any classic raunchy comedian has never prided itself on being controversial. Richard Pryor's tagline was not, "I am raw, racist and bold." It's basically how Comedy Central markets this show - in your face, non-PC and "honest" - but how can a television show be proud of being like that? Where is humility and humility? And what has suddenly made Carlos Mencia this great figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels his show (which was unexpectedly popular and controversial) and Comedy Central looks around for a new person to press. They hire this guy named Ned, who claims to be a Mexican, though he is not. They splatter the face of a couple of TV ads and make it look as if they are "bold" by freeing him from the public. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of hateful topics on the forum for this show and I do not agree with the "Mencia" critics. This is not a terrible show. It cried me in laughter a few times. When it's fun, it's very, very fun. Yes, it's juvenile - but it was also Chappelle's. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses much of the same material over and over again. And he is too obvious. The obvious marketing set aside, "Carlos" has now said prayers as many times as I have lost count. He's trying to make it the next famous line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!") But it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Regarding repetition, Carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over again. For example, he said on an episode that he would love it if all Mexicans disappeared from America overnight. He wanted to wake up and an American guy would say, "Room ser'vuce!" in a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He just used the same joke - verbatim - as a guest at Adam Carolla's talk show. It was much less fun for the second time because he seemed more desperate. Is "Carlos" fun? I think. There are some outrageous moments on his show. But he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and of course let his comedy evolve. Repetitive stupid little catchphrases again and again combined with goofy faces and loud vocal screams are really getting pretty fast ... I just hope Carlos - or his writers - can give a new edge to this show, for right now it is starting to fall repeated hell.
