I'm sorry, you know why. I feel bothered by viewing this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to watch this movie and still didn't give it satisfaction to see it in whole (I left with about 20 minutes back ... hoping for god it can make me at least enjoyable for a moment. ) Most movies now even these bad ... when I look at them, there may be a small role in the movie, where I feel a little joy sometimes because of maybe a quirky joke or a good line ... this film on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and angry at me all the time, especially when I wasted money on it. It was badly written, badly directed, badly shot and certainly badly acted ... For the good of mankind, don't watch this movie, even if your guy who says he has seen any movie ever ... just doesn't ...
