I gave the Soul Plane the benefits of the doubt and thought that there would actually be some comic value in it. I'm not black, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate black comedy. I know, because I happen to enjoy seeing Wayans Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I've seen crap movies and are not easily repelled. As for Soul Plane, I didn't even finish it. Don't know if they managed to land the plane and I couldn't fit less. It would be unfair to say that I did not find any fun parts that I laughed at, but I also laugh at Youtube videos of skateboarders who fall on their nuts so it doesn't say much. The men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas during the mating season, which seems to "get something" when and wherever possible. And we wonder why all these stereotypes do not seem to disappear. To sum up: Soul Plane makes Harold and Kumar look like The Godfather.
