I was forced to watch this movie for my World Reigonal Geography class. This movie is what is wrong with America today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations, we would rather complain about how others are wrong. This movie goes through Flint, Michigan's downfall, and claims it 100% at General Motors. In doing so, Moore goes to great lengths to make General Motors' leaders crooks just because they do their work in a capitalist society. Moore is filming several exposures throughout the film and does not even ask whether the person is being postponed due to a GM dismissal. In addition, he never interviews tenants of the tenants who are admitted. Moore goes in great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda.
