I did not have particularly sliding doors or twice on a day, so I certainly did not excuse this poor second prize for these movies. An idea that has been put to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is sloppy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity just to get an R-rating and some Scenes that just weren't needed but were there to push the boundaries (I really don't have to watch a child urinate or a fight with a membrane. Especially when they have no connection or use in the movie). <br /> <br /> The act was also very poor, the only actor I found least satisfactory was her daughter; the rest was two-dimensional and absolutely incredible. The people I saw this left the room halfway through; I managed to finish it, but not without prompt transmission through part of it. <br /> <br /> Overall: Nothing new here, it's a generic and boring movie. The few little entertaining moments are far offset by the stupid or stupid. This would be boring even if it hadn't happened before. If it wasn't such a rehash, I would rate it a five, but even for an indie movie, this was seriously lacking, and as a rehash it also loses its originality: 3/10.
