This movie might have been an impressive epic, but the decision makers seem to have done their utmost to make it foolish. Even God himself is not spared in this movie, as his words are imbued with childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and annoying. Only people who don't care to see a cheap parody of the biblical story may see the film without embarrassment. The producers of this tasteless production should see 'Il Vangelo secondo Matteo', a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which shows that it is not necessary to ban Bible words to make a good story; The most impressive result is achieved by a sincere reproduction of the ordinary text itself.
