Usually when I don't see a show on an original round, I find it later on cable and realize it's a gem. "Gimore Girls" is one of the rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it. <br /> <br /> I really despise showing that every minute is filled by actors room with rambling, stupid, dull treasure. It's only an hour. The mother Lorelei made me wonder if she is bipolar and of her lithium. She never stopped talking; Every minute every second, talk to each person she interacted with. Even worse is her talk childish and so like Valley Girl. She talked about guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what is the sitchen ?? (for situation). I've seen this show three times and still don't get points in this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it has no meaning, except to make three generations of females in a family, similar to "Girls" from Planet Mars. The males for comparison are clever and make the show a little visible. If Lorelei ever existed and tried to lock me up with a conversation, I would have to crush her to get rid of her. Of course she doesn't know how to take a subtle tip on stopping talking and starting listening to someone else. She also doesn't know how to really notice other people's existence. <br /> <br /> In a show, Lorelei comes home from a date close at. 22:00. She got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction. She goes into her daughter's room, where the daughter asks how it went. She dithered about how boring the guy was. Her date somehow got word in edge fish. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (choke). Hopefully the date learned how lucky he was. Another person here commented on how the mother acts as a teenager and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei herself dressed as her child. This, of course, 40-something mother dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her colleges in tow. I thought this show should have been followed by "Just Shoot Me" because that's exactly how I felt.
