On the bright side it ended. Of course, this is the only thing this film is about to make. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. This movie is actually so horrible, I went and changed my rating for the Children of the Living Dead to a 2 just not to be Raptor. Official one-line rating: "Bring me to another movie if you want to live."
