This is a horrible excuse for a show. People say their witty and intelligence? I can't see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Maybe because they are snooty, use dry humor and have 2-dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy League school and no one was anywhere near as uncomfortable as these characters. In fact, I had met someone like them, I would probably choke them! The men seem like little emotional pre-teen girls and all minority people are based on stereotypes ... The characters are NO ALL AUTHENTIC. Simply put, the sound like a trailer park family is trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain-dead prime time viewers eat up regularly.
