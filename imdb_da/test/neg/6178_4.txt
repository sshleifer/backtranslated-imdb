I watched the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. At that time it was 8.0 and I thought "wow! It must be a good one". I thought wrong. The beginning of the film actually keeps what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially beneath its basement. I think without Richie Nix's character it could have been okay - even though he is the reason why history takes the course it does. The character is just too extreme for my taste and hard to endure. Also, the journey that the main character takes from the beginning of history until its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily be omitted - the alternative is, I just didn't understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit it is "easy to see" and I had no trouble sitting through the whole movie when I was done, I was a little impressed by the end. All in all, pretty pretty mediocre.
