To be honest, the popularity of this show is hurting me. Inuyasha is certainly not terrible - it has some good moments, the occasional flash of smart humor, and, unlike so many animes, dignity. But it is completely lacking in the essential elements of a worthy history. From the beginning, its premise judges to be stereotypical. The main plot focuses on gathering the parts of a broken jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and as a presumption is a completely generic epic fantasy affair. The story follows a familiar pattern of fighting various enemies of jewel pieces and is therefore quite predictable, lacking in complexity and easy to lose interest in. But as many animated people have shown, poor performance can be saved with deep, realistic characters. Unfortunately, no story of Inuyasha rescues. Kagome, the protagonist, is the stereotypical anime lucky (and too reminiscent of Akane, the protagonist of the original comic author's former work Ranma 1/2); she is kind to other women, but treats many men, especially her love interest, with unfair, untouched, unjustified brutality. Inuyasha is a hard-on-the-off-but-sweet-on-the-inside type, and Miroku is the unfortunate pervert stock of stock. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings continue with what happens to this plot and these signs - nothing. Despite constant action, history does not develop. In spite of regular romantic moments, it also does not matter. Despite ample time, the characters never really change. And to add a cherry to the mediocre's sundae, all this stagnation is stretched for approx. 150 episodes. My last criticism of this anime is the animation. Although not at all ugly, it shows almost disrespectful laziness in the creators. The animators seem to be delighted in long scenes in Inuyasha, jumping through the air with wind flutes, where they have little to do but move a background. In short, with all the beautiful animations in the world on one's keyboard fingertips, there's absolutely no need to see Inuyasha.
