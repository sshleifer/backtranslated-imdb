As I mentioned in other comments, I became a great fan of David Bradley ever since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". The guy is good at doing martial arts, has a kind of charisma and is a tough looking on the screen. Unfortunately, he went to the DTV department ever since his debut and has remained as one of the king of the kings until 2001, apparently stopping filming. Now, one thing looks at Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice, which is crappy clichéd movie, but really fun to watch (coz they're entertainingly bad if it has any sense), but another thing looks a tasteful boredom like Total Reality. I mean, this and the crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse moss, this guy has ever done. I would not recommend this not even to the biggest Bradly hardcore fans. If I had known this and the Crisis was to be such a crap, I would not have spent the 3 or 4 euros they cost me. Total reality is as boring as crisis, even though it's fun, it starts promising. A group of military prisoners in the future get the chance to stop some kind of disaster in the past (I'm sorry, I don't really have much attention to this horror) and they only have 24 hours to come back or something like that. If they do not, they are stranded there forever. The poor director who monitors this, "tries" some humorous (?) Clichés like the prisoners arriving on Earth and not knowing what a truck is like (wow, hilarious ...). The movie follows up with David Bradley along with some maids for the rest of the girl. This bored me so much that I had to force myself to see it as 3 or 4 rates at least to use the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. It's coz every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a movie with David Bradley with just a crappy 10 second battle situation in it, then it's the last touch that would help throw it off a hundred foot rocks to never see it again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this pile on the street and I swear to God I will ask him back for my 5 euros. I would also love to meet David Bradley to ask him why he chose in God's name to steal in this bad excuse for a movie. Don't even bother with this movie, I mean it from the bottom of my heart, not renting it and especially not buying it.
