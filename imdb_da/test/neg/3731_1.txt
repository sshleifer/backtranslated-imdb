Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most obnoxious movies ever made. It has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man. At the wedding she meets her brother Jjaks. They have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run together. The other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find his body in the bathtub and bury her. He even seems to be friends with Jjaks and they are trying to get money together because a person detests them because he saw them and the body. These loops and more characters die or come back to life, but it never comes with something that could be called a good plot. The performances are horrible by virtually everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. Direction, dialogue and visual effects are just awful. A disgusting and horrible movie.
