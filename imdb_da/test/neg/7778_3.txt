As usual, another masterpiece in the Vice Academy series (HaHaHa). I don't know why they even bothered to do this garbage bin. Just another series of police acting slutty. One crucial part was when Ginger Lynn Allen's character (Holly Wells) and Elizabeth Kaitan's character (Candy) tried to seduce the scientist by wearing anything other than their bra and underwear during their labcoats. Just a wonderful scene (Ha). A sign I did not like was the Commissioner. He was very annoying and ignorant. They should have arrested him. Mrs Devonshire was also quite annoying. They should have stopped this series after this movie.
