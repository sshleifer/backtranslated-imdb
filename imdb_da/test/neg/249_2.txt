I am a big fan of bad horror, cheap horror, b-movie and all that is under 100 movies and I do not deny that these are the worst things ever entered on the big screen or even your home video for for that matter. Some of them, e.g. The infamous Manos The events of fate are really bad, and seeing them, especially on their own without friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema. <br /> <br /> However, La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano was not that bad. Well, of course it's BAD - it's stupid, dated, grainy, cheap, etc. There is an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, etc. The assembly is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best that Mexican low-budget production could have offered, etc. Yet the movie is FUN. It's so bad, it makes you laugh happily for an hour. Sure, it depends on one's sense of humor, but I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any novice to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Please note that the film lasts about an hour, and I think it's just enough time for stupidity, it's easy to digest. <br /> <br /> There's also another thing - see La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF / Horror genre concept back in the 50s when you compare it to today's Matrix era of movie entertainment . I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, because the clock like La Momia still attracts full house in the theaters to some special shows (movies like this are especially okay) and often receive a standing ovation.
