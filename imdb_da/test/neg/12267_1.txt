Everything about this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> In the first five minutes you can tell that this movie is going to be horrible. However, you cannot measure how bad it gets. <br /> <br /> We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene with home music and no dialogue. Having the camera move up and down big guys trying too hard to look like a mentor does not cause the slightest feeling. What begins is one of two separate stories. The first half of the film is made up of the wogs that go around in competitive midnight battles with other ethnic groups. The guards always win, of course, because they seem to lift weights and have "respect". It is in these scenes that we first see the degree of bad acting, editing, scripting and hate for the people who funded this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the protagonist and his friend are sent to prison. The whole prison part of the movie is not related to what I assume is plotted and consists of a bunch of matches. <br /> <br /> Once out of prison (3 years for murder?) the protagonist and his mate reunited with wogs. They then go to "the other side of the city" and try to lie low, for apparently everyone would like to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon the guards will be set up for rape by another gang of girl and run around the city battling hordes of different gangs. This point in the movie can be compared to an arcade game as the wickers just run around and fight for enemies who seem to get worse and worse while the movie continues. At least, the movie ends with some massive climatic battle scene, where the remaining wogs (the two main characters) take on each time they have fought so far. Apparently, the other gangs do not have a problem that unites taking up the remaining wogs (the skin holes do not mind Asians). After about a million more people are beaten up by the invincible wog brothers, the film ends with the protagonists on their way home. However, they do not make it home because they are burned to death by the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie can be more like a computer game than a movie because it would explain how two guys can take about a million beats in the face of a million different people, the majority of the time being two times their size. There are also tons more stupid unexplained events in this movie that an Asian fights with his own gang and takes a katana in his head just to let the wogs get away. As someone else mentioned, this movie is not that bad it's funny, it's just so bad.
