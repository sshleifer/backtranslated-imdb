Sometimes there is a movie so bad that you just keep an eye on awe. This is one of those movies. Of course, I can't help I'm biased. I'm from Chicago, so I saw the scenes carefully for accuracy, and I don't find Billy Crystal fun at all. And I can't stand all the English style photography (Tony Scott, etc.) with the smoke machine that works overtime and all the flowery, soft lighting. I suppose we should think that Billy Crystal really is from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the reason. If you really think about it, these guys must be unlocked, not the evil ones, as they are more dangerous. And of course there is the complainant's clich√© on the border to retire. But the funniest scene is the climax, where the good and bad machine guns others die in The Thompson Center (A State Building!) Of course, it's a cool building, but it's like making a huge drug deal on the White House.
