How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work at The Sopranos, I chose this at Blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise. It still does, but this movie does not meet it. <br /> <br /> Every tour of history is completely predictable; I continued to look for Lifetime bug in the lower right corner of the screen. It's all there: The noble woman comes out of hard times, the guy fails to live up to his potential despite her best efforts, the child stuck in the middle, etc. Etc. Contract. The mysterious alien identity is what really made me throw things on the TV - I would have been happier with Little Stuey waking up and realizing it was a dream. The filmmakers might as well have had a "moral of the story ..." a little before the credits, since as another reviewer this thing really pointed out roles as an afterschool special. Don't gamble, drink, not make fabrics, stay with your wife, spend time with your kids ... come on, what about a little nuance? What about some interesting evil? Writer / Instructor A.W. Wonders must be given special attention: not only is the dialogue launched, pacing (within dialogue and at each end of many scenes) making this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it should be (and believe me, it feels like longer). Imperioli, Renee Faia's talents and some of the supportive cast (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this from a "1" rating. All their good work is almost offset by the grueling work of portraying the boy Stuey. Not sure if it was a casting error (hi - it's a mob file, let's throw someone from Blue's Clues who can't do anything but over-overact with a big fake laugh ... next let's throw it hungry, bursting child in the Disney girl) or just horrible steering, but these scenes are really painful to see. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in another movie maker's take on this character and his story; it is a shame Imperioli has already been used up by this flick. Horrible, horrible, terrible.
