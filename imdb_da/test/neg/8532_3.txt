Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick appears to be an annoying clich√©d, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally incredible ending. Clue # 1 for anyone considering watching this turkey: Sam Raimi did not send it directly. Although advertising for the movie plays with his commitment, he is truly one of four producers. It's too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used with such a bad movie. I don't think he would ever have done anything like this; This task was left to the Pang Brothers. The screen shot for this movie seems to have been cobbled together from many other "horror" movies so you can find absolutely zero original content in "The Messengers." What we get is a scene here and there that was picked right out of "Pulse", a couple that could have come from "The Birds", one or two from "The Others" etc. Almost every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number other movies. It all makes it possible for such a predictable movie that almost everyone will find out the "surprise ends" long before it comes. <br /> <br /> Right here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother signs probably see them, even quite early in the movie. I'm sure whoever was responsible for marketing came up with this campaign because the movie needed a unique angle to have any chamber office appeal that is otherwise completely absent. Now you know, so don't be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is something that looks like chemistry between the actors. It's simply not there. All the interactions come across, so scary the stalk. Along with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot gaps (just what is a guy who murdered his entire family, still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, at least? Doesn't anyone think he might arrest him?) all to a deeply unsatisfactory ghost girl who only manages to surprise anyone over ten years of cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything but a painted figure that jumps out of a closet and shouts "Boo!" All we get for our buck this time is another poorly made movie about spirits trying to alert people away from a house. If there is any message that "Messengers" delivers, it's "Don't waste your time on this movie."
