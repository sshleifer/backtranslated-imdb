Make "Invasion USA" Look Like "Apocalypse Now". This can only be recommended for American skinheads, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple: let's shoot them all - gooks, commies, latinos, anything that's not American. Moreover, this is poorly behaved, poorly written, poorly interpreted, incredibly silly, but not fun at all. This movie can be used as a torch device by the CIA torturers. Oops, sorry, there can't be any American tortures because they are good
