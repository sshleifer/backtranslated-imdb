I stopped this movie in 48 minutes and changed ... I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm not Swedish ... or French (cannes commenter) ... or any of those OTHER sleepy places from where they used to reviewers highlighted ... born and raised in NY. lived in San Francisco for a quarter of a century. and now Holland. I love a good independent movie just as much as the next movie enthusiast ... but in a word it's not fun. see? Now it's fun ... that you think I made a mistake. I said, "in one word" but then said, "It's not fun" ... no. no errors. if that is your kind of humor, i would say that you have not really had much of a life ... consider your understanding of this movie a symptom ... and never ever write another review ... i tend to to believe them when they are unanimous. even though there were only about 3 reviews before mine ... i figured, i could in time be able to save any ELSE boredom ... the expectation of laughter that never materializes ... i smiled once or twice, even though ... when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. It should be 10 lines.
