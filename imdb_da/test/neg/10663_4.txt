As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: I was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached - white - to dub some of the lines of this movie into a recording studio. <br /> <br /> While I speak German, I was asked to do all the copy scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... So therefore all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough I did more characters, so if you really want to spend some time watching the movie again, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-Indian characters are performed only by 4 votes! . . . .
