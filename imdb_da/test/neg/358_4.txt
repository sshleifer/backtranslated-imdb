Despite the fact that this was a Made-For-TV movie (and an obvious one: ie cheap seen), CLASS WARFARE left me and I wanted to get the money back and given that lame production was who partially funded through Canadian dollars, I could just be right. <br /> <br /> What made me sit through it was initially to see actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I have seen over the past few years in her role as "good-good" Mara Lewis on the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT, Take a trip to play "The Bad Girl" for a change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she does well, as a Christian, a spoiled wealthy who suddenly finds herself poor, but with a stealthy streak and a destiny that may change her happiness back. The twist of fate is provided by the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a social radical excluded who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to win $ 23 million on a lottery ticket. Now put Richard, Kristen, his jock girlfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter) and their camcorder-occupied mutual friend Graham (Dave McGowan) together for the weekend in a remote cabin, cut off from the world by storms and just guess what unfolds. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from overloading both the story and the characters and the motives too much. Everyone is rather one-dimensional, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that some things and some people will go very badly, very quickly. I do not think this is the original a plot, and it does not go out of the way to make oneself more. The action is ok, McKeon is spot-on as the manipulative woman leader, and Dunne is very good, maybe a little too good at times, but no one else is worth writing home about. The only other real credit I can give the movie is the one twist I couldn't look forward to at the end (not the final end, one is so obvious, it hurts). Regardless of how I sat through it all and lived to tell the story, I can't say it was a complete depreciation. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A "something-to-watch-when-nothing-else-on" type movie.
