Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is caught in the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people. With a group of others she tries to solve and end the curse for good. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 is rehashing everything from the first and it produces only a few scares. The first Grudge was at best an average movie. The principle was decent, but the play was wood and some of the scenes were really ridiculous. Grudge 2 is even more stupid and less scary than the original. Scary Movie 4 has also made it almost impossible to take these movies seriously, and I had trouble keeping a straight face under the "scary scenes" that should encourage laughter more than fear. How Takashi Shimizu messed up his own franchise is inexplicable, but he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the film at a slow pace with a bunch of stupid characters and lame slip tactics. It was clear that he made this movie for money, and I'm glad it succeeded. <br /> <br /> The play was pretty bad, mainly because it had no meaning, and they didn't develop the signs at all. In the movie, there were three different stories going on, and each one was somehow related to the "horror". The connections were weak and a lot of people were killed without a real reason. They do not explain the curse rules very well, and it ended up being a little carnage because everyone died, although the PG-13 class kept things away from being interesting, so even though some death scenes were rather paralyzed. The dialogue was weak and none of the signs were sympathetic or developed well enough to really care about. <br /> <br /> The action was on a par with everything else, and it was much worse compared to the first. Amber Tamblyn was annoying wood. She moved very slowly on the screen and all feelings seemed fake. Sarah Michelle Gellar was okay even though she just had a cameo. Jennifer Beals gave the best performance, she had a few good scenes and was so effective. Arielle Kebbel was okay, a little boring. The rest was either horrible or just forgettable to mention. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing successor. It lacked many things and it is not worth seeing. Rating 4/10
