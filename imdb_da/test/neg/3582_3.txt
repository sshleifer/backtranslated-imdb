I caught the North American premiere of this at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was beyond disappointed. From the mood of the audience I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a long time to come to the conflict and refuses to solve it and instead chooses to tell us the story is "Continued". Is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no end? I consider it more a warning. This is at best only half a film - and not the good half.
