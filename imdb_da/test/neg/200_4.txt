I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto as a 10 year old, and the event I saw then was pretty different to what I saw at Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just looked at. I don't understand how wwE does not have rights to some of the old music since most of these songs were created by WWF, they shouldn't have to worry about licensing and royalties that prevent shows like SNL from season set publishing. It's pretty silly to gnaw about, but for me to hear the Demolition come out to their theme music on a Wrestlemania personally was a memory I never forgot, and it didn't exist on this DVD. What are they supposed to own the rights to this great video library if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?
