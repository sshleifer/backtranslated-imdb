GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin off from the mid-1970s sit-com MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE. Although I have not seen the series since the last broadcast, I remember that it is quite entertaining with most of the comedy that comes from the eponymous couple who will be living next to the snobbish Fourmile family, a kind of love for their neighbor without the cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> After seeing this "big screen version of the show" I find myself what a big screen version of? Certainly not of a popular mid-70s sitting with the same name. For some reason, the movie resumes all character interactions from the TV by having George and Mildred leave the street where they live and being caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something George has accidentally picked up. and that leads to some circling situations and lines like: <br /> <br /> "Did he give it to you" <br /> <br /> "No, this is the first time a man has resisted my charms" < br /> <br /> "I meant the envelope" <br /> <br /> You get the impression that scriptwriter Dick Sharples (who never wrote an episode to the original sit-com) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the CARRY ON series of movies. In many ways, the same flaw in the latter resembles LACE in SPACE movies because it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that created it
