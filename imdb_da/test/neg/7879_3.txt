Another French film with the absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f * ck. One of them is a porn star who escapes from his community after being raped and killed his girlfriend. The other is a hooker who kills his flatmate and sees that the girlfriend is shot dead. After these events they meet at a metro station (both miss the last train), so the whole grip starts. They find one bound and come very close. They abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive around the country and have lots of sex. It's all about Baise-Moi really. We can see that they do not have mercy on their victims. They even kill a woman for their money. Both actresses are true porn stars in France that affect the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in sex scenes, but they can't make the whole movie worth watching, for me the movie doesn't require any additional ability to act than that. It's a version of Thelma and Louise on another level. I could recommend lots of things to do instead of seeing Baise-Moi. So bother to see if you want to see a meaningless, kinky movie. * out of *****
