There is no way to put into words how badly, how informal, effortless and ridiculous these "Vice Academy" movies really are. You have to experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row, writer director Rick Sloane doesn't even show an ounce of writing or managing talent. There is nothing here that a person over the age of 5 will believe or laugh, but the (very short) nudity and other "plot" elements make the movies unfit for children. Which makes me believe that they are really targeting adults with the 5-year-old mental abilities. Elizabeth Kaitan also makes a welcome substitute for Linnea Quigley - she is winning bubbly and sweet, and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer's smile too. But watching her and the other girls in this movie is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered in manure. (*)
