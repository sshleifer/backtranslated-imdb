You have to see this. I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid ones I saw in this movie, even too late after the event. There are perhaps a million individual errors and stupidity in this movie. The action is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years old. The suspected thriller is nowhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it long after that. We had a good time after the movie. Indeed. Me and my friend spent the whole 40 min long bus ride home chatting about this movie as we have seen the next Oscar winner. Unfortunately, we talked about all the bad things we had just seen.
