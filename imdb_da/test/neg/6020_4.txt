STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely manufacturer who trying to keep up with his work and being a good father to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother (Maxine Peake.) But after a confusion with the daughters present at a Working Men's Club, he uses one go to their dance class to take a look at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his gang of hard men who train in the box gymnastics / free weights section and train into a harder and more confident person. Before long, he has taken Louis philosophies to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman when the 80's discofare kicks in ... but when Associate Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to make a sideliner in drug trafficking, everything becomes pear-shaped . <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once said in the movie A Bronx Speech, "there is no greater tragedy than waste of talent." The author of Clubbed had a good idea and a talent for making it a kind of movie ... but without the ability it seems to put it together in some kind of coherent movie. <br /> <br /> As a hummingbird, some of the movie venues (especially a scene at the end outside the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot ... but the look of the look is really a downer on things. However, some really bad actors, such as the actor Raido with an impossible accent that is everywhere, and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue are major issues for the movie. More established actors like Peake and even telly favorite Neil Morressey are sidelined to very small supportive parts, while the disastrous Raido and Ronnie Fox's lame villain takes the center. Williams makes a poor man's Sick Boy from Trainspotting impressions, leaving salmon and Shaun Parkes apparently the only artists left with no integrity from it all as the exaggerated platelet violence (becomes a common trend for Brit flicks!) Takes over. Really a missed opportunity. **
