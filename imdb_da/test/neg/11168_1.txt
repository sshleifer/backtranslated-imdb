Stay away from this movie. The fact that you read reviews tells me that you may already have been contaminated by the horrible action it carries. This is a really horrible movie ... so let's get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldn't surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers who so 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes in abundance; while i cannot congratulate them on this movie, it is great to know that they are finally potty educated. Actors (or lack thereof): Only the finest for this movie ... the finest extras ever to grace a screen that is now starring in their talking role debut! As a disclaimer, I notice that I am able to see and enjoy almost everything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I still giggle and smirk under Bubble Boy (yes guys, that's true); So when I say to avoid something, you know I'm not kidding.
