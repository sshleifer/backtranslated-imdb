Well, it's the standard Hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile away. It's fun in parts, but just oh so predictable. I have to admit that I don't really enjoy it, but I'm pretty hard to please, and many of my friends loved it. It's pretty sweet, and the actors give good performances. It is a beautiful background and the eye is pretty good. But the annoying predictable, unoriginal and really rather boring story contains the film back. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The chick flick genre gets some bad presses, but there are some really good chick flicks out there; This is not one of them.
