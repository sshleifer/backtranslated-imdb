This movie starts out as if it were a comedy. It seems almost the actors are reading cue cards, especially in the airport sequence. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe," a hunter who is quite transformed and horrified. Smith always seems to play villains as in "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "The Frisco Kid" (1979) to name a few, although the heavy role in this movie seems ridiculous. This is one of those films where meaningless things only take place to fill screen time, such as the hunting sequence at the beginning and the long, stupid motorcycle race. I give this movie 1/10. I would have liked to watch this movie at the "Mystery Science Theater" it would have been fun.
