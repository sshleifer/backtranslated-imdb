I found my tape of this long forgotten 'show'. In addition to the theme song 'DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE'. This show is hardly available. You will pass through channels, just as the couple blinks through the TV channels. This is a parody of television. <br /> <br /> The beaver is cool. The gay Dracula, the chicken discusses Peria's experiences and the lady with the excessively large lips discussing homosexuality shows us everything that is wrong with TV. It's all bad. Like beaver from outer space, which seems to be lost in this new world, you will also be. *** out of *****
