So far, I have not liked every single Jean Rollin movie I have seen, and it has always bothered me because he is a recognized Euro-Trash monument and extremely popular with many regular reviewers on this lovely website. people whose opinions I always appreciate and usually agree with. Apparently, everyone always seems to identify some kind of gloomy and stylistic film-forming marks in his work, which is completely lost to me. Rollin's movies are incredibly boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in different settings), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the amazing gothic setting is always underutilized and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I had actually given up on Rollin's repertoire already (especially after lasting "The Iron Rose") until I found out the "Hunting Night". Allegedly, this movie does not have any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with cruel kills and macabre plot twists. And the verdict is ?? Yes and no! On the one hand, this is undoubtedly the most compelling and inventive Rollin movie I had the pleasure of seeing so far (and also the only one I see without turning off ??). On the other hand, it still remains a moronic movie with an indecent plot and emotional gender sequences to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin gently tries to create an atmosphere of secrecy and excitement, mostly through lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but hardly controls the fact that he actually has no story to tell. The gorgeous leading actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautifully uninhibited musical guide are the only items that keep you hooked on the screen. During a nighttime trip home to Paris, a young man suddenly has to stop for a confused and barely dressed girl coming from the forest. Her name is Elisabeth, but she can't remember anything about herself or from what or who she ran away. Her case of amnesia is so bad that she even forgets who picked her up. The next day she is kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a creepy apartment complex where several people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she makes sense that she must escape from here. Of course, I do not want to reveal the old age, but I can assure you that it is rather stupid, illogical and removed. Apparently Rollin understood that too, because the explanation is kept very short and quick. There are a large number of too strange and meaningless sequences, the sex movies are gloomy and filmed without passion. The unpleasant make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown out for real purposes. As said, the score is fascinating, and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is addictive for glazing.
