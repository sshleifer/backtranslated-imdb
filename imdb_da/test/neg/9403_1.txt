This is probably probably the worst movie Al Pacino could have recorded. The movie had no real plot. That kind of care in 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this movie is people from the gambler's anonymous. Mad Mcconaughey's character is not credible enough to be Pacinos protégé '. So he won a few games for some degenerate customers as a sideline to a shitty job shot at a 900 service. Should it automatically convince an audience of his skills? It was just stupid to think about. The trailer promised to show us how to make his sour shot choices, but after reviewing the whole movie, I haven't yet seen the skill he has ever had. If you want skills, try looking at Robert de Niro's character in Casino now, it's showmanship. At some point in the film, Mat's character chooses his winning bets by a flip of a coin. Anyone could do it. Al Pacino seems to talk a lot and I mean blabber mouth in your face dialogue. I think the style started with the scent of the scent and worked for him because he finally won an Oscar, but now I think it's just annoying. He seems to be always predictive. He does a mediocre act of portraying a man who has unstable angina (that is, an impending heart attack). It typically resembles his performance in Godather's part 3, as he plays the aging, diabetic mafia don corleone, but except that Pacino's talent is wasted on this movie. Rene Russo is simply eye candy for this movie. She is kept in shape and shows it in the tight clothes she wears throughout. This movie is pure crap. Don't waste your money on it. It's much worse than gambling picked by Mats' character in the movie.
