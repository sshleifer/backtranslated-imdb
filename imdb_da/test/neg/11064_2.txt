When I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it might be a little good. but no. It was an OK movie, not good, but not bad for the most part, but then you come to the end and it loses all credibility. they should have just left then died. they did not leave the last bit, it made no sense. if they had anything about them they started on a plane crash yes, but we didn't do it so it didn't work. the first bit is OK and i give them the credit for it, but the rest is just flying badly and unnecessarily if you are thinking of going and watching this movie DON'T it is terrible, go and rent something that is actually worth Look, I give it 2/10
