Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time someone sees this mess! Fine costuming and sets can't even overcome defective performances by Joanne Whalley (as a title character) and stubborn Timothy Dalton (like Rhett). Even worse than the play - and perhaps partly explain it - is the script that is amazingly clumsy and predictable. Add to the hell bad script a score that makes you ring and you have a disaster that I would not want anyone to see. SCARLETT is just incredibly miserable and I can't imagine how it was ever made, much less made it to video.
