Wow! I'm really sorry to see this picture ... Funny, I went in to see it just for my wife who endured the torture to see it in half an hour before retirement while I was in front of the TV but only to feed the masochistic in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeeming aspects that could relieve the feeling i had of being stupid to see this **** called Two girls and one guy ... Everything in this picture is wrong, quite wrong ... since the original, absurd premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend until the terrible but merciful, don't stop forgetting the three actor's terrible action ... Don't believe the rumors, the junkie act is bad, and I can't see how Graham has made a name for himself in the film industry ... <br /> <br /> I wonder why the producers after the producers have saved some money with only three players and e a single location, not hiring a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his *** ... At least I felt a little fine when I destroyed the DVD and threw it garbage bin ... Anyway, I liked (and just a little) the brunette actress Natasha something, but it wasn't enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of Face-off (changing faces), so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
