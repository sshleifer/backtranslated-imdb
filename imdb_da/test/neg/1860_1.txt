Wow! This movie is almost too bad for words. Of course, the authors somehow wanted to link this with the Ghoulies franchise so they got Pete Liapis from the first to reproduce his role as Jonathan ... only now he is a policeman and has no similar characteristics as he did in it first . Ghoulies in this one are not ghoulies from the last. The cheap-looking dolls have been replaced with even cheaper looks costumed by small people. Instead of being a main antagonist or being evil, they are more like the comic relief characters that seemed to be out of nowhere, for no reason. <br /> <br /> When you watched the movie for the first time, it felt like I'd seen it before. Why was it here Because everything in this was stolen from another movie. All the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from deadly weapons. The Ghoulies were pretty much like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except that they were not entertaining at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies movie were sprinkled throughout this flick. I think the target audience should be adults, but the blend of black magic, cartoon slapstick, police drama and bad plays doesn't work at all. I hope they don't make a Ghoulies V because I don't want a movie studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 min. R of violence.
