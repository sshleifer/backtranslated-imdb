The actors are so boring that it is almost impossible to tell them apart (Pauline Kael said about this movie: "The actors have names but they are really anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and reusing the trick that lets Fred Astaire dance in the ceiling of "Royal Wedding" (but none of those guys move well enough to make it convince). <br /> <br /> The lowest point of the movie point is when one of the characters, an aircraft's tycoon, tries to convince some other "giants in the industry" to come in with him in a moon-cathedral consortium and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon explaining how a rocket works on 2nd grade level! (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the manuscript ...) <br /> <br /> The only plus is that the production design manages to communicate some kind of "Amazing Stories" sensibility, and even that much better in the manufacturer's ( George Pal) subsequent film "When Worlds Collide", which has similar bad plays, but is much more entertaining. However, Pal's best sci-fi movie must be "The Time Machine".
