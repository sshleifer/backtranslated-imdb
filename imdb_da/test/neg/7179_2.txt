This is undoubtedly the worst movie in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor to make Carl Hamilton. Peter Stormare just can't pull it out with his psychotic appearance and no style at all. He may be good at making killers and psychotic maniacs as in "Fargo" or "8mm", but in this type of roles he is just useless. <br /> <br /> Lena Ols's presence did not use this movie. She couldn't save it from being what it is: an American copy of big budget action movies such as "Goldeneye", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow", etc. This movie has no Swedish in it, but the actors. It is clear that some Norwegian upstart instructors at McTiernan as model manager have done this. br /> <br /> Mark Hamill's presence is just ridiculous. 2 out of 10
