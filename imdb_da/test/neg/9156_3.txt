This was the first Chan movie made by Monogram. What one comes down to from Fox values ​​and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first monogram after watching the big Fox movies. This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan quietly walks across the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No. 3 son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter together, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than the later Chan driver in the later movies.
