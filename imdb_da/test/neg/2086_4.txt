This Spaghetti Western uses three American main players who take a bit of the typical spaghetti aura. The ground is about an amnesty, which the governor of New Mexico allows all willing criminals to give them a chance to start a new life. Normally, this type of opportunity is limited to past events, but in this movie it seems to be a license to kill because even new crimes (such as threatening the governor) are forgiven. The story is an endless chain of killings, where almost all characters only aim to deliver more bodies. Only the few leaders have endurance. Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where he surprisingly killed many people. In the midst of eternal chaos, this kind of reflection lacks credibility. Compared to similar films such as. BANDIDOS none of the characters in this movie was sympathetic to me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the faint content aimed at specific customers, this movie is well shot, sets are somewhat detailed and the play is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
