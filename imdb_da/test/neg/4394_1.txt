When I went to the video rental store to get a movie I saw this and I immediately thought it would be fun. The picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers (eg, Road trip), which I thought would be worth seeing. When I pulled out, I was disappointed when the jokes were horrible and cheesy. The only bit that the director might have thought would be fun was someone slipping onto a wet floor. This is not a joke and would not make people laugh. In fact, I was considering turning this movie out to get halfway through. I was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money to rent it out. There was not enough care to make this movie and not enough time and work put into it. I also found the actor to be rather poor. The only time I laughed was at the extremely bad "jokes" or actions that were really not fun !!!. I rate this movie a 1/10. I hope you found this comment useful.
