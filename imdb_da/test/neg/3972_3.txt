I'd say this first ... the movie would have been a 70-year-old sci-fi classic if it had been done much better. That being said, let's examine the plot ... it starts with Peter Graves (or is it Clarence Oveur?) running for president then cutting it into a huge university campus-like environment full of authoritarian in goofy trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who are all acting as if they are eternal age 8. It then shows that a guy apparently travels to America, has a party and then goes to a medical laboratory where he is drugged, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors baked vegetables for steam packs ... okay, actually he is put on ice so doctors can extract the organs they need. <br /> <br /> It then cuts to another drowsy man thinking of the place he lives in is a bit strange after a beer can (of all plot units) in a river he gets to to look suspicious (damn the beer cans!). He and some equally stupid love interests for his feelings, they need to get to the bottom of it all, so he does her behind as he escapes through what is basically a great college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the road for cloning. .. and how he is part of it. <br /> <br /> He escapes his controllers after being shot, and an old reporter guy helps him find his "father" - the man he was cloned from. It just so happens that he is a clone of Peter Grave's brother. After debate on what to do with him and his evidence, he goes back to the plant to find his girlfriend (who has meanwhile been lobotomized to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to host a solo show according to SOL crew). He is trapped and put in cold storage just like his Nazi retardant from the start of the movie. At the same time, a confrontation in Graves 'brother's house results in several deaths, including Graves'. The reporter's guy and his wife are killed in the midst of an exciting conversation with a bomb. It seems that the composers have won to some degree ... Peter Graves turns out to be able to survive running through a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parts and giving another voice to me 'talking like reporters confronting him with the cloning stuff. Definitely MST3K feed, but at the low end of the spectrum as far as the general badness goes.
