Boy Oh Boy, stinks this movie. This movie is one of the worst pieces of waste I've ever seen in my life. Please, although your life depends on it, NOT, and I repeat: Under no circumstances should you see this horrible piece of waste. Just watch this thing when it comes to an MST 3000 episode. It was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I were to see it without showing, I would have stopped seeing it before it was over. It has a use: A Cure For Insomniacs !!!!!
