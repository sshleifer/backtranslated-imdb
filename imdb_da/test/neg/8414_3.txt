This movie is a bad movie, but to get any nutritional value from it, I recommend watching it back to Rosemary's Baby. There is much to see how different instructors can draw different notions from the same actors playing the same characters. Pay attention to Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film against the horrible reproduction of this movie. It is also interesting to see how the same characters are played by different actors. Which makes me wonder if anyone involved in the sequel was aware of the first movie and saw any of them at Rosemary's Baby before they did it? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is superficial, then you'd better avoid this. I have a lot more to say about this movie, but I really don't want to go there.
