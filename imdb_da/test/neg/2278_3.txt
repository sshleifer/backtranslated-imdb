This is what used to be called a "women's image" and later a "chick's flick" when times and movies became more youthful. The reason is only soap opera for women and will only appeal to these types. The only appeal to most guys is if they want to see a shiny thin Mary Tyler Moore in leotards. (If you are of a certain age, like me, it may still be enough to give it a look.) Otherwise, MTM gives another of her typical by-the-numbers performances that she has given since the beginning The 70s when she took it to heart that she was an American girlfriend. Christine Lathi gives another one of the frightening and unpleasant beliefs that seems like a real part of her as a person and probably only appeals to those of that type. Sorry, but it seems true.) Ted Danson is too young as MTM's husband and usually gives a little scary appeal unless he has an actress who can soften it. And it doesn't happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably got it all through because he worked with Mary before, wrote it as a project for her, and she had juice at that time to get it done. There seems to be no other purpose for it.
