What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better than this. To start at the beginning, JT was terribly mistaken in the lead here. The role required a person who could convince himself as a degraded anti-hero, a person who could look at haunted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would have watched the bill, or even Al Pacino, but JT is just too alive and seems to have too much fun. Anyone who has been through the mill to the extent that JT's character had had little physical effects? The sign presented to the audience looked as if he could start so close to Oakland Raiders. Scarlett faired a little better roll-wise. Where was the pain and conflict in what should have been worrying developments? And as for the "plot" ... yes, none of it makes sense. The characters jump from one frame to another apparently for no reason - and certainly without explanation. The pace of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely the pace. This is a very slow movie, not that I have anything against slow movies as long as they are going somewhere. The pace only runs up to the end when it changes from a slow dirge to a giant race to pack as many tired cliches as possible. Here it succeeds - the only thing that has to be something that involves a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one exclusively for Gabriel Macht's performance - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well-cast and b) could convince in his role. All in all, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a few hours.
