On paper it looks like a good movie. Michael Caine plays a hard and ruthless boxing promoter whose son is up for a title eliminator. Too bad is that when the story is transferred from paper to my TV screen, it loses a certain everything. I was hoping that we would be seen, imitating his final role in GET CARTER, and as the film progresses, it seems to take on the qualities of a hard, gritty revenge thriller, but the whole tone of the movie is jumping around so much that you get confused about which genre it is trying to fit into. For example, Caine (Who you can't believe as Billy "Shiner" Simpson, he is simply Michael Caine) has a laugh out as he refers to someone like "Hattie Jacques", then in a presumed humorous moment he has broken an arm of arms . Oh how I laughed. I think it should cause a laugh as it plays on the screen, isn't it? But these seem to be in contrast to the way the rest of the movie plays out. Of course, director John Irvin does not know what approach to take with Scott Cherry's manuscript. Irvin is not a bad director and is well-versed in his war films, such as. THE DOGS OF WAR AND HAMBURGER HILL, but he is poorly suited to this kind of violent drama, and you cannot help feeling that he may have been frightened by a living legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression that he is just doing it for the money, and the familiar faces that support roles like Landua and Cranham are basically just cameos that could be played by anyone
