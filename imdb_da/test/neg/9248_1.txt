It is only a forehead-slapping, painfully silly scene after another, as the clown-like, corrugated cardboard carvings, which replace actual humanoid characters, push, pull, and pull the "plotted" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. <br /> <br /> If I were to describe this movie to anyone, I would call it a mutated hybrid of Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber, and the three stooges, with a "climax" inappropriate resembling the episode of Family Guy where the whole family enters a knock-down fistfight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Advice for the Benson Family: The next time you get a new pet, make the poor animal a favor and don't name it Fred!
