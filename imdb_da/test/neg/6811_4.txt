I give it here: I didn't stop watching, and it's not corporate, which is a little cool. But my internal critic cut it down - I suppose I see too many movies. Wood scripts, snake just kind of sounds out of their mouths without any kind of flow. Editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; Sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel, but mostly its annoying - jerky, quirky angles and really boring lingering face close-ups. The actors were marginal, though Letisha had his moments. I'm not sure why the audience should worry about Curtis, he is a total screw and the actor is totally expressive and not very funny or loving. The Executive does not help to make you love or hate him; I just wanted him to stop and get shot already. I didn't care about his impotent revenge as it rolled around. The completely predictable ending is not at all credible. I'm not sure why we should believe some formerly successful dealers he deposits are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams. "Oh, you're just out of jail and are trying. Here are thousands of values ​​of cocaine, run it around the corner for me. Don't let me steal from me, etc." <br /> <br /> A good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but eventually it was let down. Handling a rape scene was a little eyebrow, only mildly interesting. There are better movies in this genre that do not offend your intelligence by trying out some kind of authentic ghetto realism, while more like a movie school offer. 4/10, and F.
