I literally ran to see it, expecting a movie that makes me cry or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not heartbreaking, but a lame exploitation of one strong human character. /> Interwined between a couple of young lesbians and an overweight man. <br /> <br /> In a setting that is essentially devoid of sound, not to mention the most common. <br /> <br /> It wasn't quite BAD that I've seen worst - and I left the movie theater $ 10 poorer but wiser - that a FILM well advertised is not the same as a MOVIE WELL MADE.
