If you, as I, actively seek out the rarest and strangest (and often most horrible) world cinema to offer, then look no further than Hong Kong's supernatural horror production in the early 80s. Often we mix bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy and usually filled with lots of creepy crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, thousands, etc.). These movies are almost as bizarre as it gets. <br /> <br /> Succubare is definitely a matter of consideration: With a mountain tribe whose women keep their husbands from deceiving by throwing unpleasant spells over them (if they leave them, they fill up with angry creatures and die a disturbing death) so martial arts and lots of real kills in reality (much of which is committed by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on history), this movie is simply weird. <br /> <br /> An extended scene in which the tribes hunt for snakes and insects that accidentally throw the creatures into the basket on their backs is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor bull bashed upside down and then torn apart is utterly disgusting; and the moments that show that the worms are crawling in open wounds and being vomited on the floor will lose their lust for a while. <br /> <br /> But it's the live animal munching that really qualifies Succubare for legendary status among fans of out there filmmaking. It is thoroughly staggering to see and yet strangely convincing: the nerd cheats on a snake, woofs down a fat, juicy toad (nasty!) And consumes hungry a mouse (bites off the head and then pushes the rest in afterwards). /> Not a good movie (hell, it's not even a mediocre movie). Succubare is only recommended for people who think they have seen it all. This gets 4 out of 10 from me, which is probably more than it deserves, but I respect it to make me feel a little sick.
