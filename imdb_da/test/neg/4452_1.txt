This should be one of Cinema's greatest debacles. I walked Europe at that time and had the misfortune to stumble across the crew who made this movie into what was once the world's idyllic, unspoiled setting. I was admitted as an extra and it followed an exhibition of modern debauchery. Forget all the accusations you've ever heard of Peter Mayall's intrusion on this rare piece of French life - Geoff Reeve and his cohorts went on a level of clean-up at the Les Beaux restaurant that left the Maitre'd, who was unbelieving . They were simply awful, un-cultured and unworthy of French hospitality.
