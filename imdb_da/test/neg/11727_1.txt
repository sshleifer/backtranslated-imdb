It was badly shot. Looks like a rush job, last minute casting is obvious. Writing is very weak. Good for stage, not movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not had good roles lately. This role was not for him. Maybe happy that it has been picked up yet. At the festival, this film will remain.
