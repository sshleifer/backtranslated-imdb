Here's why this movie dropped very little of its potential (I don't read much so I don't care what the short story was). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man from Lambert's Tarzan. It was stiff, and while his Tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They screwed up with the story. Perhaps that is how the book goes, but as long as I can remember, Tarzan's first expression was "Me Tarzan, Jane". Jane is the first human tarzan meeting. I looked like the natives a little more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in Weismuller's version, but they bend and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. Tarzan is primarily a love story. I'm sorry, but the love interest goes over an hour into the picture. It qualifies her for a supportive role at best. Supporting roles and wires do not fall apart, not enough screen time, sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell's vioce over pathetic (probably because her strong southern accent could not be masked) the chemistry scale between Tarzan and Jane was a whopping 0. I never thought they loved each other, which made the Belgian Dudes close the voice honestly, silly . When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels a craving, if you like, a feeling he has never felt before. Jane brings mankind into him, and he brings out the untamed side of her. Its this chemistry that tells the story of Tarzan. Not that Lord Greystoke's dying desire is to keep his country entirely and that Johnny Boy will do it for him. Even a good facelift couldn't help this movie. It needs massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show the sound phase as qualities of the place. Finally judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry Tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, drop Lambert and check out Leonardo Dicaprio.
