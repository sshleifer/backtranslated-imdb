*** This comment may include spoilers *** Warning: this contains spoilers I've seen some pretty lame movies in my day. And it only says to see when I see about 80 movies a year. I have to say that out of the 80 movies I see in the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that big, 40 or 50 is okay, and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely horrible. Here on earth falls into a category for themselves. This is one of the most predictable, violent, despicable movies I've ever seen. It's filled with unlikely signs, maudlin situations about after school-specific types of subjects and probably fluff in here to make the kid and the restless look like American beauty. And I'm not unfair. This is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town making fresh cookies every day for the whole city's folk music. Will you be warm and unclear yet? Let me continue. One day, the rich twist will melt into the city with his new graduation fight, which his father bought for him, and he insults the beautiful girl at dinner, almost gets a fight with his long boyfriend and fights him and destroys it little eatery she works on. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and his boyfriend have to make dinner together. What this does gives us plenty of opportunities to see Chris Klein without a shirt so we can understand why the girl at dinner would fall for him. He has abs !!! Oh, and he's rich !!! And .... he is the biggest shake without respect for anyone. He is James Dean, he is a rebellion who doesn't give a shame! He is rude to anyone in town, he does not want to connect with anyone trying to be sweet to him, and he seems like a spoiled rich abrupt. But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him. There is no reason why she does, she just does. Oh, excuse me, it's true I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet she does. Well, if it doesn't get you wet, then I don't know what it will be. <br /> <br /> Here on earth also some of the most predictable moments I've ever been allowed in movies. There was a point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read graffiti on the bathroom wall, and I told my fiance what would happen in the next ten minutes. When I got home, she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said there should be a dance scene. And besides, the disease she is contracting suddenly is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums start to rot. It's not a beautiful picture. Sobieski shines after she has cancer, as if she is pregnant. What insult to people who have seen love dies from this disease slowly. And how can you get crack cancer from falling into the field? <br /> <br /> Now, I realize I've seen too many movies, and it causes my cynicism to run violently at times, but that's ridiculous. There was not one thing to like about this movie or Chris Klein's character. He is a smoker, he is uncomfortable and he never tries to make peace with anyone around him. Here on Earth is not just a bad movie, it is an irresponsible. This received a 4.2 on IMDb poll and that is too loud. This is a genre for screenwriting, and the one who gave the green light to this is not only going to lose their jobs, but he or she should be allowed to never step into a script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and it's generous. This film should be shown at film schools like how not to write and lead a movie. <br /> <br /> If you get bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this movie, choose cleaning the manure. It smells better and you will feel that you've done something good with your two hours.
