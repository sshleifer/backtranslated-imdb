In a farcical key, Gaud√≠ Afternoon can be taken as a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis pivoted a good cast (Juliette Lewis' newborn freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality, I know an American young lady who squawks like her !!), but GA doesn't show much beyond her overtone plot. <br /> <br /> Although filmmaking is about making faith, there were some noticeable manuscripts inconsistencies. Two samples: You pay 14 euros to get into the chapel, where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at. 7, and you cannot leave a terrace without paying the bill (they charge you on the spot if they do not know you) or come quickly from a taxi (you Americans always skip cabbies even if they do not expect that, but the sequences are depicted in the film was ridiculous). Don't believe me, the reader: come see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you have never been here before you may not worry about all this, but good movies must be credible without regard to your origin. No one knows GA here and I want to make sure it doesn't change in the future.
