This show lasted in most of the 1980s and had its moments, but plots of water were usually thin and often painfully unfunny. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, they both deserved better, but it does make some good memories, and I've found myself smiling at some repeated scenes. June Whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to shine through at times (when she's not Terry's foil) and she's really smart. The 1980s are the last decade in which you find this kind of middle class, medieval comedy, and many people remember it wisely, but I prefer to remember the decade of alternative comedy and the pointed satire in Spitting Image.
