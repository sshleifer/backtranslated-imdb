I usually do not categorize a movement as boring. I'm not big on action flicks, and my senses don't have to be stimulated during a movie. In fact, I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and history line. Unfortunately, this film has none of these properties. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie, and even her beauty can't save it. Terrible indulgent music is similar to the moronic dialogue and play. None of the actors actually connect each other and as a result the film does not associate with the audience. I suppose the scenes where the cities are marching somewhere were supposed to add to the story, but it seems they were inserted just to fill the space. The scenes seemed choppy and incoherent. There were some good shots of the sea and the beach which were beautiful.
