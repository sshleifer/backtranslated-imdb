If any movie ever made the Italians, it looks bad, then it is. Duke Mitchell - What is an A-HOLE? Duke Mitchell, I'm on your grave. As almost all people shot in this movie by the swept Mimi are either black or another racist or ethnic minority, it is hard not to be convinced that the guy ultimately owes his belief in the Ku Klux Clan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be too bad, doesn't he? WRONG. Typical softheaded sentimental tripe. Although I understand why some people may be affected and even to some extent admire the film's hideous, totally un-PC envy (it is certainly unashamed by its own hatefulness and sense of self-esteem), but this does not change the fact that the protagonist, Mimi (and, consequently, Duke Mitchell), is a thoroughly shabby man who does not earn a single form of empathy or interest, especially as Duke Mitchell is such a complete BORE as an performing artist. But what do you expect from a guy whose main fame requirement (except this dog t-d in a movie) was another set of Dean Martin imitators?
