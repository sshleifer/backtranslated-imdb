A group of four young men attending a prestigious private school belong to an old covenant formed by their ancestors during the witch's hunter in the late 1600s. They each have a power that ages them when they use it, and they suspect that a new kid at the academy could be from a family considered to have gone long ago. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all the supernatural things, but it's really just an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Focuses almost exclusively on being cool and smooth and paying only minimal attention to the plot, which has lots of unfortunately unused space for interesting twists. But no one was put in, and even before the movie is half over, you know what is being played and by whom. There are a few good scenes here and there, especially an exploding car that is magically reconstructed after colliding with a large rig, but it's about it. What's worse is that director Renny Harlin, who has some very entertaining if it's not smart movie for his credit, relies heavily on blowing metal music and too sexy leads to that movie, and it may make it the silliest "horror" movie since the disastrous "Alone in the dark." It's not as bad as "Alone in the Dark" as the few slender scenes are actually clever and not ridiculously incompetent, but ultimately the highest thing this movie can hope for is a cozy and cozy home on the sennate cable. 3/10 <br /> Assessed PG-13: Violent Action
