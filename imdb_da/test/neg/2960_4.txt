This widespread and sloppy spy melody, featuring two buffoonish (an idealistic, a drug addled) California child who holds secrets with the KGB, never seems to get enough steam to sustain tensions and tensions before it dies a very slow death over two hours later. John Schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he fell asleep in his director's chair most of the time while the film is being let down and the actors are sleeping, except for the very annoying of Sean Penn's best performances. <br /> <br /> Childhood boys and friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) are designing a plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris lands a job giving him access to top secret government materials. Disillusioned with what he sees as American interference in foreign affairs, the idealistic Chris and the hungry Daulton make contact with the Russians and begin to haul them classified materials. When Chris decides, he wants things to start raving at a flawed pace. <br /> <br /> The 80s were not kind to distinguish director John Schlesinger. In the 60s and 70s, he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but then came Honky Tonk Freeway in 1981 and marked the beginning of the end. The falcon and snowman put more or less a lid on it. Lacking the excitement of the Marathon Man and the quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier) he coaxed from the leads of the past Falcon goes in circles for the most part. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn speaks the landscape from start to finish in such a disgusting way that you encourage his torture to do more for him. Tim Hutton is ruled by his limited play, and most of his scenes show a need for more probation. Lori Singer as Hutton's boyfriend plays the mute mostly with Schlesinger's content to film her vapid expression. When she does emote you understand why. Only David Suchet as a KGB deal with a transparent eye-introspective presence and restraint rejoices well.
