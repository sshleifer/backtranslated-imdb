Buyer beware. The alpha video release uses a print that damages the description. The film was shot in color, but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The printing used is so faded and diminishing that it appears almost sepia toned. After 30 minutes some colors suck back into the print, but from there to the conclusion that the color comes and goes. Remember, although the best color is pale and washed out. It seems that the pressure was absorbed by a television that didn't get the best reception. Adding to this travesty is the most plodding supply of lines that I can remember. Even the voice over the story is stupor inducing. Each line is delivered in this annoying terrific behavior. I found myself wishing they would hurry and get the words out. For this reason, I couldn't wait for this movie to end. It's one of those bad - it's good movies, but I want someone to find half a decent print.
