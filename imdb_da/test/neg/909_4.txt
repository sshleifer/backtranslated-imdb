The story starts in the home of a little girl who has to have a birthday party, and both mother and father seemed to be pretty quiet and reserved with each other. They continue to give their daughter her gift, which is from both of them, and it fixed me fun, the expressions on the two parents turn out when they gave their child this gift, it was almost like, 'I hope she likes it '! There is a killing in the movie, and Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, gets involved in the case because of family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor, and this particular murder disturbs her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top", 03 is a neighbor next door in the same apartment as Julia, and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad movie, but it is definitely not going to be crazy unless you like a film placement in Canada and a beautiful Catherine Mary Stewart who is native to Canada.
