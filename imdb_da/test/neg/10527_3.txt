This movie was disappointing. After 15 years, when it was reminded of going through some information about Mariel Hemingway, I still felt the movie came back. While I remember Peter O'Toole, I was totally unaware that the female "lead" (okay - she was a little more than an object of discussion in history) was Ms. Hemingway. I watched this movie back in the days when I wrote movie reviews and warned people about it as the stories just didn't work and fifteen years of my subconscious attempt to sort things has still not made sense of the flow of ideas. Part of this may be due to the fact that it looked like after the original film (what it was about) was filmed, entered an editor and tried to get something out of it. I do not know if this was a project of a former study director, and it was so sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor, or it was a disaster from the original manuscript trying to save failed. The theatrical version just didn't work.
