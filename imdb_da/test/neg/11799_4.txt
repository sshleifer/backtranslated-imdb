Ted Nicolaou made a lot of good horror and fantasy movies. I'm looking for all his movies to see. I couldn't find this for 3 years until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth, I wanted to see more ghosts and smaller conversations here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis, maybe in money. His features in this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim to be a bad instructor this time. Everything happens. The end has some nice, scary details and excitement, but the whole movie was long boring dialogues. <br /> <br /> Only for real Ted's fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
