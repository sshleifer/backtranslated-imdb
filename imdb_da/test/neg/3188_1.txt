Horrendous's "comedy" where a beautiful, crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comic" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a hitman (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What happens to comedy? The year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats etc.). This is one of the worst. There is not one, repeat, not a fun moment in it. The jokes are either stupid, unfunny, smutty or real sick. There is also a strong hatred of women in this waste - the only most important female character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sex object. Also, extreme bloody violence is thrown at the end. The only portable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychoses. Dillon, Goodman and Traveler have hit an all-time career low with this - the only way to go up. And poor Tyler! She stops making intelligent, gutsy independent movies for this? And DOUGLAS ???? What was he doing when he agreed to this? A whole piece of shit - to be avoided at all costs !!!!!!!!!!
