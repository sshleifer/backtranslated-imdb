I've just seen Lonesome Dove, Return To Lonesome Dove, Streets Of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk. All excellent. This junk excuse is cheaply executed and badly acted. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gus McCrae come out as tough respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by another actor every time I quickly won me. In Dead Man's Walk, the boys are credible as the younger versions of the experienced Texas rangers. In Comanche Moon, they are just a few lumpy rednecks. I had to stop watching. <br /> <br /> I suppose many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinky pile. It is a sad ending to an otherwise large franchise.
