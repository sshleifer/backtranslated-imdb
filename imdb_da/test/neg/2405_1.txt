This movie has the distinction of being the worst movie I've ever seen, and the only movie I've ever given a 1 out of 10 on imdb from yet. I was fooled to rent it because of the cool H.R. Giger cover art on the box. This cover art is the only thing that is least good about this steaming pile of ... It was about frat boys who fought "freaks" in a strange but not least interesting post-apocalyptic world where the cities are in ruins / chaos But apparently, the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to blow other men into braindead organizations. The most uninspiring performances with boring characters, not so special effects, boring, unoriginal sceneries and only generally extremely poor quality in all aspects of production make this lemon lose at all times on my list. FINALLY RATING: 1/10 I wish I could give it a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
