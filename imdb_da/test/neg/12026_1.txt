You know, I really hate the IMDb censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you curse. But here we go. Editing time! <br /> <br /> Holy moley is this bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie judging by the plot collection, since you've blindly rented such gems as Frailty and American Nightmare before. But it's just abominal. It's about a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works as a reference for his murderous exploits and the story of a detective to stop him. Can't these blithering hacks make a good movie without destroying the grave of a great horror writer? I think the killings here are completely devoid of thought or originality, and the references to Poe are hokey and false, without enough to think of them. They are low and they shame Poe's work. Full of holes with terrible sequencing. The action is also bad, and reminds me of the abortion known in some third countries as "Fear X", what about all the break and un-emotional lines. I realize this is an indie movie, but it's no excuse. I've seen high school children seem better than these morons, and I myself could have got better kill scenes and a better plot, given ample time. <br /> <br /> This has no reason to exist. Avoid at all costs.
