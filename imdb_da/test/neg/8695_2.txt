From the English accent to the so unnecessary violence after violence. Shows Moses as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there shaking their heads. I'm not at all a religious person. But even I felt as if the authors of this film were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews. When Moses took up that stone and threw the first stone to the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to close the authors. I can't believe in this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would try to show such waste like this. Don't we have enough problems in this world already?
