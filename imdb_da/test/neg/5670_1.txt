I ... No words. No words can describe this. I will try for the few brave people's guilt that keep knives in their toasters ... after seeing this show. <br /> <br /> This ... Cosgrove person ... Her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance on the grounds of heavily agitated insects. Maybe I'm exaggerating. However, I have the feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show. The characters in this repulsive pile of raw wastewater are just as useless as a small piece of space rock flying into the sun on any day of the week. Although heart attacks have not been experienced while looking at them, acting like fools on the cheaply built sets, I have no doubt that this will happen in the end. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this * belches high into the faces of the faces of actors * is the stupid girl who hosts a live weekly webcast on the creatively designated iCarly.com with her mindless friends, one of whom owns equipment which the producers of this show are unlikely to afford. Her guardian is a kind of moron who seems to be her elder brother. I have not seen this whole show for fear of developing cancer or perhaps a cold, but some of the plot points I have seen involve the brother stuck in a lift, the doorman in the apartment almost dies and the world's poorest priest comes to visit. No, really. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you are at the age of the unborn or if you have a history of dealing with mysterious cultures because of mental trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh when the slat track tells you, as it will drown the repetitive noise that eventually puts you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. <br /> <br /> The view receives a star rating because IMDb has inexplicably not adopted the use of negative numbers.
