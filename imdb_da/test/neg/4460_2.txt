Veteran British television director Alan Gibson's "Dracula A.D. 1972" qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries in the Hammer Studios series on Bramoker's immortal blood sugar. In fact, this first time since Terence Fisher's memorable "Horror of Dracula" (1958) represented that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other as deadly enemies. They would render the same roles a few years later in the final Hammer Dracula: "The Satanic Rites of Dracula." Furthermore, it was the penultimate Dracula for Hammer, where Lee acted as the infamous catch. To the album was "Dracula A.D. 1972" the seventh Hammer Dracula. <br /> <br /> The exciting prologue from 1872 prepares you for something very different from what the rest of this disappointing horror flick provides. Eternal rivals Count Dracula and his nemesis professor Lawrence Van Helsing are literally in each other's throats on a trolley in London's Hyde Park for an energetic opening scene that makes everything look rather anticlimatic. The cart goes down, and Dracula is going to hug half a wooden wheel with its broken spokes embedded in the chest. Of course, Christopher Lee must take this broken wheel against his body, but the pictures are striking enough in his own way to pass the pattern. The Count expires, and so does his opponent Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples rages the Count's ring and scoops some of the vampire's ashes into a vial for safe storage. <br /> <br /> Don Houghton's manuscript harms the action for hundreds of years to swing London in 1972. We meet a smarmy young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass") who loves to travel hell with a group of hippies colliding parties and running the British police with their antics. Alucard happens to be the descendant of one of Dracula's servants. Now Alucard has the Count's ring and a vial of its dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the sight of a dismissed church to arrange a black mass. He invites his trendy friends, among them Laura (super sexy Carolina Munro from "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to participate in this black mass because it gives them something different. Not surprisingly, they revive the Count, and the evil blood sugar sets eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body is discovered by blood, Scotland's Yard Inspector Murray (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and the Dalkes") seeks help from Van Helsing's modern offspring Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula will only claim Van Helsing by taking the latter's grandson as his bride. Lorrimar runs down Alucard; They struggle in their apartment in Chelsea, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. Remember, running water is just as deadly for vampires as sunlight and crossfish. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the deserted church with her daughter waiting for the count. Van Helsing and Dracula tangle. Van Helsing slips Holy Water into Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open burial ground with a stick waiting for him, and he breaks down again. The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we don't get enough of Lee as Count, even though we get considerably more of Cushing as van Helsing. In addition, the scenic Don Houghton Dracula keeps the ramshackle church limited and never allows the vampire to venture out into the city. Despite the low budget, "Dracula A.D. 1972" could have been much better. The scene where the modern Van Helsing has to put Alucard and spell it backwards to get Dracula seems almost ridiculous. You'd think he'd know about this backward spelling. Unless you're afraid of horror movies, this will make you yawn. Occasionally, Gibson presents us with an excellent close-up of Dracula with his bearded fangs and bloodshot eyes, but it's about as scary as this chiller gets, and that doesn't say much.
