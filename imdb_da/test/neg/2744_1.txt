I admit a secret admiration of the original Love Thy Neighbor TV shows - mostly because they show the kind of incredible brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programs in their era - but I will lie through my teeth (very unpleasant position) if I pretended that this big-screen spin-off is nothing but an abomination. Open scenarios for malicious vandalism are not only meaningless, but also confusing - it is never explained why the film opens with a trace of people throwing each other's houses - and nothing is improved from there. At the time the film revokes the oldest joke in the book - a terrible mother-in-law's unexpected dragon becomes unexpected - followed by the crashingly obvious revelation, she develops a soft spot for the black neighbor's father and moves her bigoted son to ever greater depth self-righteous, ignorant anger, most discerning viewers will be turned off. Take it as a warning unless you are eager for cheap treasure spin-offs with horrible acting, static direction and the overall cartoon flair of a burning orphanage.
