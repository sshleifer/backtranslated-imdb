PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting. <br /> <br /> Let's tackle the signs first. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold a monstrous boiling anger throughout the film, due to her overwhelming passion for prom prom. But it becomes completely unknown to the public why Cherry wants to become a prom queen in the first place. Before the nominations are just read, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest in being there and showing no interest in the place or the students at first. Why does she worry so much about being their prom queen? Apparently, Brooke Balderson presents a "recognized" performance, but in reality he always uses an angry face, stompes around and kills people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you handed a young actor / actor a script that only requires him / her to act crazy, you're not asking too much. You also do not allow the character to develop very well. Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character at all. When she is harassed by her principal, she knocks him down (after several seconds) without feelings of disgust or shock or anything as traumatizing. Her lines are read as if she is reading trivia from the back of a grain box. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the movie, students responsible for his kidnapping read more like planning a barbecue than deciding what to do with their mains, tied in their basement . At the same time, Cherry is turned off to kill several female prom queen candidates, and no one knows or cares for herself. (Yes, I understand, I get it, the whole city is worried about prom. Very realistic. At least you can throw some fun scenes with the police, but it may be too much.) For example, just after Cherry runs the school and shooting down a handful of students, Beth is found to be interviewed by the local media. The reporter mentions the "shooter" in a way that makes it seem that nobody knows who killed these innocent students, but then asks a second later: "What do you think of weapons in the hands of minors?" or something thereof. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen, prom is considered to be over. With the media reappearing, Beth simply adds that "she understands (Cherry's) must be heard" and goes away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unchanged mood. No one is even dismissed by the fact that they are just witnessing a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that students are constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seems to care that there is a sudden increase in the violence in the city, Julie, who lives in a large house without parents present and the bizarre party in her house (maybe I'm a little back from the scene, but for the last time I didn't know that colleges involved naked women who artistically danced in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and all baskets in their "I am so indie and against" attitudes), Beth's parents' horrible action with his mother, who seems over-the-top and her father just nods on everything the mother has to say (or in an entertaining way) along with Stupid scenes like the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and sharp with each shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad is the play and the script not.
