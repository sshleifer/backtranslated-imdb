Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... Not a bad cast in my opinion, but they were totally wasted in this movie. There was no real direction that was nothing unusual In fact, the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying sidekick that did nothing but annoy you from the start. Rosario Dawson was completely wasted and there was hardly any point in having his character in the movie. I really think this is one of them just for DVD movies that everyone will forget very quickly, which is a shame as the movie could have been so much better.
