This movie reminded me much of a song by Dead Kennys called "Straight A's." But unlike this film, the hero of DK's song turns to suicide. You want this bozo to resort to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did. It all coincided, and in the beginning you sympathize with the film's hero, then he quickly rejects your sympathy. The long sequences of just showing the hero's face while delivering a monologue pulls the movie down completely. Avoid this if possible.
