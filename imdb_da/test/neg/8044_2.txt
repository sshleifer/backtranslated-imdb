Poorly made political action. Poorly photographed, acted and corrected. Each scene is the underlight, including the very few that are shot during the day. It doesn't matter what the location is. At an important conference in the White House there is no light on, and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a couple of windows. China's primary leader is an earthquake phone call under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should consider a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honest. It's as if he had a little spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness. The death of the slow movement today is mandatory in a bad thought film. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo are good at their roles, but Scheider is rarely on the screen. The other performances are dismissive. There is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight run that forms a gun and is straight out of a Bond movie that accentuates a childhood spent in Basset, Nebraska, and who should have remained the model she probably started as. Anyone who plays the survivor secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for that part because he looked most like Johnny Depp, not because of any talent show. The Chinese villains that represent both Taiwan and mainland China harbor and laugh as they threaten the heroes. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty horrible, recycled from other, better movies. There are many shots on the ship and almost everyone wins meat. Two-thirds of the way through explodes the ship in the expected series of fireballs. Then the film is split into two related parts. Share one, another shootout, this time in a water house store. Part 2, an exchange between the vice president, now acting president and the oily Chinese premiere, lifted off by both "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe." We're launching our missiles immeasurably. They launch their in return. We cannot convince them that our launch was random, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. There is even the George C. Scott / Walter Matthau General who claims that their "nuclear" arsenal cannot match ours, so we should beat them with everything we have. More fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end does not come early.
