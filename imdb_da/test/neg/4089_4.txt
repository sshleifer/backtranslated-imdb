Now I watched this movie expect to roll in the hallways ... how wrong I was. The movie was moderately entertaining at best and annoying at worst (slapstick comedy styling to build a sheet of archaic tools, laughs ... no I didn't). I'm very disappointed when Steve Carrel was the leader. I have looked at the office religiously, cracking me tremendously, I thought 40 year old virgin was good ... but Evan jumped us - why on earth he accepted this script. And as for Morgan Freeman - he's old enough to know better. <br /> <br /> Then the idea seemed reasonable, the actors I had every belief - but the execution was nothing to write home about and the end, well it seemed like they had run out of money or ideas. This for me was one of the most enchanted conclusions I could have imagined. They took a biblical story and stumbled it down to a warning of localized environmental problems, not even global problems, but a local bill - yawn! <br /> <br /> In summary, a reasonable start was gradually getting worse and for me, it was all washed out at the time the credit rolled.
