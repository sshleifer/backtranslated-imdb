There's not so much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically, it is a couple of episodes by Rocky Jones, the Space Ranger merged into a movie. However, it is extremely dated. Winky's treatment of Vena is a good example of this. It must be borne in mind that it was intended to be shown to children in the 1950s. In this respect, it succeeds. If you like children's sci-fi from the 1950s, take a look at it. You can see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. He does a pretty good job in it. All in all I would give it a 6 out of 10. Not great but not bad.
