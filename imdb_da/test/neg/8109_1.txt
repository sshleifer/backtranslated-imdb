There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD, but I doubt it. I have no idea how this manuscript made it past the shredder. It's terrible. Totally uatches. I hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the operating time) and just couldn't stand anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the 90s (see "The War") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shift from bubbling to serious this year (see "Chasing Liberty", which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of "Run Lola Run." So with three wires I liked this one should have been fine. It wasn't. No one got a good performance. Woods Jones was flat. For a hopeful writer, he had no imagination beside him (his fierce fantasies looked as if they were ripped off by "A Christmas present" and his merry being - a cross between dull and alarming). Potent is absolutely unlikely from the first second, and I would only know that she should be the "girl" reading the box. Talking about synopsis - who they employed for that job made the movie sound fun, quirky, romantic and quite fun. The person he or she was, he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script. At halfway, I didn't care about any of the characters anymore. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who is bubbling and a little conniving (with no apparent cause), but her ridiculous period game (which must be fun in the presentation) is on par with the rest of the script. There is apparently a happy, romantic comedy ending in this turkey - considering the drawing material they might work with, I just can't imagine it. Save your money. Warn your friends. DO NOT see this movie.
