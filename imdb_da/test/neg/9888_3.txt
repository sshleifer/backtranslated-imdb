I think the best way for me to review this title is to divide it into its pros and cons. PROS: ~ They turn into wolves rather than plastic / cartoon-like monsters. ~ the wolf's hunting through the forest ~ "Cash Machine" by playing hard-fi <br /> <br /> CONS: ~ Some parts of the script make you cuddle (for example, the awful part where the woman escapes 'de' Fortunate Five '' boys' and there are about half an hour of "Dear cousin" and a round robin of "Yes, we know Gabriel's law") ~ The diving transformation is ridiculous ~ The obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden is told thousands of times to leave, and then "if you cared about me, you would have left me" ~ the obvious signs ~ the unnecessary step ~ the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm at Aiden ~ cringey speaks by Gabriel <br /> <br /> You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I love werewolf movies and I tried to watch this a couple of times to see if I liked it better, but it just made it worse. I think I just want to read the book and see how I move on. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister to scary things. Anyone above this age likes and wants their one and a half hours back.
