I think Purvis is starting to make a gay "gone with the wind" If yes, sorry Tag, it did not happen. Nor did it happen as a gay "sexploitation" flick. I think I'm confused; What are we trying to do here? Much as I would like, I simply can't get to where I don't care about these signs. This film is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence living in the south; It does nothing to explain, enlighten or promote my understanding of a homosexual relationship, or the conflict that the protagonist seems to have struggled with.
