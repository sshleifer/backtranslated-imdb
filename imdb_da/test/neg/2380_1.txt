This movie almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was about to start appendicitis some years ago, I was just starting to teach in high school. The whole teaching business was a bit of nervewracking for a beginner, but mentally preparing to go back to the classroom I decided to watch some pretty horrible movies. Flintstones was one of the movies I chose, and then I put "King of the Streets" (the British title "Alien Warrior"). Just before it was finished, I found myself almost in tears on the sheer waste of everything ... my life, the film store, the two pounds I had paid for it a few weeks ago in the Blockbuster ex rental, the time it must have taken to print the bracelet, the efforts of the editors and the musicians involved in the soundtrack (as insignificant as their efforts were) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me make it clear - I love watching crappyfilm from Blockbusters. Me and my friend Dan used to sit and see many, many cheapjack gravel and laugh at them. But it was another type of crappy movie. I don't think anything has come close to this, not even Tobe Hooper's "Death Trap" (which is probably my closest movie in the world). Whole to make a car from abandoned section sections almost killed me; Repeating music at any free option, regardless of screen events; whole .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can't even continue this "critical" dissection when my gag reflex is started. The annoyance of that movie, even now, three years after I saw it for the first and last time, still makes me speechless (but I can still write). The whole section "Making a car from odd parts" had considered terrible things. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching this movie, just ask the front page of the video and imagine the worst possible version of history's synopsis on the back. I can almost guarantee that it won't be as bad as this movie actually is. Under no circumstances should you actually consider seeing it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see a Christ allegory; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you will experience the true nadir for trash can; Not even if you want your life to work longer (and believe me, every second that this movie is running like at least a minute). Don't make mistakes, this movie is unlucky. It is the antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett in Get Shorty said, "I've seen better movies on teeth".
