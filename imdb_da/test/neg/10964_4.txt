The movie of the movie is pretty simple: a virus outbreak made the population into carnivorous zombies. Those who left were "hunters". <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is NOT the worst zombie movie there is. Among the worst is "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". In fact, I think the idea of ​​"Quick and the Undead" was very good, just done badly. Given the budget they had to work with, this movie looks very good. I was not bored at all while I looked at it. Special effects were solid even though they used CGI once (bold zombie was shot in the head), but everything else (gore, gut) was pretty good. However, it is terrible. Our main guy looks like young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. As far as the plot goes, they did not work enough on the history of history. <br /> <br /> Bad: Play, Low Budget. Good: special effects, idea for the movie. Overall, this flick deserves 4/10 from me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a ZOMBIE WESTERN so watch this movie.
