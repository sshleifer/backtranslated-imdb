When I first saw this DVD in a three-dollar trading box, I really couldn't believe my luck: a Christmas movie starring Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I immediately picked it up and found it a valuable investment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was just as bad as any movie you would expect to combine Christmas and the three aforementioned "celebrities". The dialogue was inane, the characters were one-dimensional, and Carol's character arch was absolutely incredible. The film itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to finish and made me feel used as a human being when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not watch the movie unless you are and then only under the influence of a serious holiday oak.
