Butterflies are an entertaining story of two fictitious cities and their combat. It is also a misleading allegory of cold war and arms race in general. Yes, it is a children's book, but like many of Theodor Seuss Geisel's works, it hits people with their morals. And the moral is what, exactly? Sure, it is legitimate to encourage us to concentrate more on what unites us than what divides us. It is even a good thing to encourage international cooperation. However, to equate the differences between the Warsaw package nations and NATO west to a difference in butter application is simply wrong. To point out the obvious, many Warsaw Pact nations had periodic periods of lack of butter and bread - they would have been happy to eat that butter sideways if it was available. At a less literal level and regardless of your political inclination, Soviet socialism against Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not a single preference and custom issue. To make the point even clearer, nuclear weapons were not developed in a war war with the Soviets, but in a hot war with the ax powers. There is no doubt that Germany developed nuclear power during the war. Would the US have abandoned nuclear test to put their trust in their (less than inevitable) victory in the conventional war? When weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy who attacked us at Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this time when the genius is out of the bottle? Moreover, the overhaul is 20-20, which means that there was no way to secure another semi-shaped dictator, would not increase his eyes on developing nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War has shown the incredible difficulty of establishing credible threats and neutralizing them. <br /> <br /> In any case, the comic is a little more than simplified propaganda, which does nothing to explore the nuances of the ethical issues behind nuclear arming and instead tries to instill fear of weapon technology for children.
