"Happy Days" was produced and sent from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and seems to be more ridiculous with age. At the time of the broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950s in the Middle Ages with families, and the scenes at Mel's Diner had probably an artificial nostalgia for them. Of course, Fonz was the coolest of the cool (although actor Henry Wrinkler has never learned to ride a motorcycle this day). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blond-haired child likely to be elected president. Potsie was Richie's best friend - star's star must have a best friend, I think. And Ralph Malph was bumbling sidekick to Fonz, if not the whole group. I loved it when Fonz would look up on poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the Middle Ages, running Mel's Diner. And of course who could forget about Mork's appearance? Was this really the 1950s? Ironically, films produced in the 1950s as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One" have improved with age and portray the period more honestly than this show, which was produced 20 years after the period it depicts. <Br /> <br /> The TV show "Happy Days" is unfortunately not in the same league as "Rebel Without A Cause" or "American Graffitti" for that matter. "Happy Days" may have caught some aspects of the 1950s with its burger diner, juke boxes, cool cars, and sticky plaid shirts, but it's more of a nostalgic idealism made strictly grin rather than an honest portrayal. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" was more about what middle-aged people of the 1970s wanted the 1950s to be like. The result was a form of water production that really has nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Days" is at best a comedy fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950s as a background. As pointed out by another reviewer, the all-American child Richie Cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending as a drop-out as Fonzie. And Mel would probably ban Fonzie from entering Diner. <br /> <br /> A quick story: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot called "Love in the Happy Days" that was rejected for posting. Comedy pilots who had sex and romance themes that did not make it a pilot flight, sometimes appeared on the rarely broadcast show "Love American Style", which was often sent instead of baseball games that had figured out or other unexpected programming cancellations and / or changes. In short, "Love American Style" was a throw-away show that featured all these episodes with an episode that never made it a slots debut. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared as a "Love American Style" show sometime in the early 1970s, but at that time, television leaders could not imagine how a show around the 1950s youth would be popular, especially in the holidays for comedy shows centering on middle-aged people, such as "Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and its subsequent spin-offs "Rhoda"), "The Bob Newhart Show" and "All in the Family". (How things have changed since now are most television sitcoms about young people, and the industry avoids most shows in the Middle Ages like the plague!) Subsequently, one of the young stars is of "Love in the Happy Days", a children's actor from "The Andy Griffith Show" named Ron Howard, got the chance to steal in a film about young people that took place in 1959, called "American Graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose former "THX 1138" had bombed miserably at the ticket office. Even when it was premiered for film-savvy, the studios could not see how a film about youth in the 1950s could become popular because it didn't "fit" with what was popular in the past, even though they didn't realize that much of the film's audience was young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the film was a big hit, and the study leaders recognized that they had completely offended their audience. Somewhere in the course of the "American Graffitti" theater, television leaders realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault, much like "American Graffitti". They brought it back with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler as "The Fonz", the title "Happy Days" and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows in the 1970s. <br /> "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The signs are flat and cardboard, and they are never more or less than the superficial ones. The problems they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem unconscious and even stupid. Today, the character of Fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, The Fonz. Was the idea to be a sort of parody of Marlon Brando's character in "The Wild One"? Looking at the show with fresh eyes, I feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism that could still be fun and entertaining. Instead, the producers decided for cheap laughs for quick money. This is definitely a show that has not resisted the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many of the outward views of "Happy Days," but it had an edge. It was honest about the signs and their problems. "Happy Days" took the look of "American Graffitti" but failed to take its heart.
