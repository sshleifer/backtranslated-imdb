Can you remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS. One edition by Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) interviewed about his new movie GLC: "It's about a man, a regular man whose wife and family are being wiped out by insects and I have to chase them and kill them in a sadistic and graphic way" <br /> <br /> "And after GLC what next for Bronson?" <br /> <br /> "We are using a new angle. My family does not get wiped out but I go for creeps just the same" < br /> <br /> This clarifies the evil that men do. It is a Bronson vigilante thriller, where his motivation is not down to a blood fever, but it causes the credibility to be tense. Bronson is a retired merchant who does not give up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape with interviews with the victims of "The Doctor", not the legendary time traveler, but an infamous expert on torture. It has never really been explained why the doctor is so infamous, since every police state has a myriad of these sadists, nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents. As you might guess, it's a silly written movie and events happen because the scriptwriter needs things to happen to promote the plot, no matter how unlikely they are as one of the bad guys being invited to a triangle, so he can be killed or things are revealed as the doctor's sister is lesbian, so some T&A can be included <br /> <br /> In many ways, it's like one of the nasty Chuck Norris vehicles released at the same time, but The most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX AND NAVERONE GUNDS Two very well-founded war dramas that are often displayed on Sunday afternoon. Believe me, this movie won't be shown well after the water block
