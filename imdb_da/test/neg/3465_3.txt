How many times should I write the words boring and not fun on this page until I get to ten lines. George is about original an actor like Alfalfa from the small rascals. Although it is probably a bit too Alfalfa. How many times have I sneaked into these overpaid actors crappy movies before I learn that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's bad. They use millions to make this movie, but can't take a moment to see the end result. And Renee GoAwayZigger should stop taking the illegal drugs she's on and seek medical attention for the facial problems she is sporting. In any case, I hope her drugs, as she is quite uninteresting, as she speaks out on the mouth. This movie was neither fun nor dramatic, and these hacks should just stop shit like this. George and Ren√©, you should be ashamed of yourself and stop stopping smelly greedy.
