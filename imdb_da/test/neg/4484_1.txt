After reading reviews I am so relieved to know that I am not the only person who was very disappointed with this movie! I'm a great Nicholas Sparks fan, have read all his books, most of them more than once. Of course I LOVED the laptop and a trip to remember ... I haven't yet seen a bottle or nights in Rodanthe so I can't comment on them ... <br /> <br /> But I did go see dear john last weekend and i was horribly sorry! The movie was not good at all! Looking at the movie alone and not thinking about the book at all, it was still a horrible movie. I didn't get the rush and series of emotions from this movie that I got from other movies I enjoyed, especially The Notebook. I didn't smile and laugh and cry and worried and scared ... ever! From the beginning I could only see how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie, which looks like the book, is that there is a guy named John who is in the military and a girl named Savannah who is not .... the part about his father who is obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book. Everything else was completely gone !!!! First of all in Allen was Tim's little brother, NOT his son! Why should they change it, I do not understand. It made a lot more sense how it went in the book when Tim was just a little older than Savannah and they grew up together, and Allen was Savannah's inspiration for working with horses and autistic children .... it didn't happen in the movie .... ugh ... And in the book they spent much more time together than just the first 2 weeks and then the 1 night ... why did they leave these times ??? I could go on and on, but then I would run out of space! So basically, if you're a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, don't waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's terrible and nothing like the book!
