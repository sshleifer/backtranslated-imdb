A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino), set a fake serial killer after stopping for a "comfort break" on a distant road stop. <br /> <What may have been a scary chiller in more skilled hands turns out to be a confusing, uncontrolled mess under the dull direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the script). There is a lot of juicy violence, a short talk of nudity and assertive notions from the cast, but the stupid script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that one cannot help but feels disappointed. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the movie plays as a standard clich√©-ridden 'killer-on-the-loose' movie, but Shiban (an author of the X files) throws in some subtle supernatural elements, suggesting that his goal was something else entirely: a ghost story, while the rest ceases to act as the home of a revenge ghost to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> Reading the movie, checking out the viewers' theories here on IMDb and looking at extras on the DVD, some record elements start to make a little more sense (though there are still many unanswered questions) even with the benefit of extra information. In my opinion, any movie that requires this much study to make itself (only partially) understood is not very good.
