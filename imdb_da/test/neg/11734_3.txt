The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and is, in my opinion, one of the best films all the time. The decision to shoot a shot with shot remake is therefore a little rude. <br /> <br /> The cast of the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a beautiful boy, hunk and is not very convincing as Bates. I can imagine that actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro are doing a much better job in the role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a venerable job, but mentally joins her to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here, and Viggio Mortenson only goes through her role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as the private detective. <br /> <br /> Though director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can't build the excitement that Hitchcock did. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark and humid and enclosed, while in this version it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory setting. And I think the black and white photograph of the original has a clear advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another mistake might be that most movie guests have seen the original and know what will happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, if it's not ink, don't fix it. <br /> <br />
