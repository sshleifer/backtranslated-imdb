Fred "The Hammer" Williamson delivers another cheap movie. He could have set a new standard for himself. Look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible on the street during a hunting scene. You can't see it just once, you see it several times. Look for it out of focus shots in a scene and the camera operator is trying to correct what the scene is rolling on. Watch this with a group of people and create your own Mystery Science Theater!
