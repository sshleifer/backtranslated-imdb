Kasparov vs. Deep Blue is undoubtedly a fascinating story, but I don't think you would know this movie. I think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that IBM cheated ... and what is this theory about? The idea that the computer at one time made a move "so human". I'm not a chess master or a computer scientist. And while I have no doubt that the movement is so human, it does not seem to me to be beyond the possibility that the most powerful chess game ever created could make a surprising step ... or that such a machine could beat even a genius like Kasparov. The film gets too much mileage out of this theory and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved ... who could have made it a much more interesting story. The direction also relies too much on the impressions of a pointless whispered narrative, and the image of an 18th century chess player that looks like one of these animatronic gypsies narrators, you see at the carnival. The story was also slowed down by many empty shots from Kasparov, who repeated the "scene of crime". I have no doubt that Kasparov and the chess community found IBM's behavior confusing, but I don't think it's different than you would find from any other big company. At the end of the movie you are back with the feeling that Kasparov is a big crybaby, and the Deep Blue programmers are either victims or cheats. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe in the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented many more evidence. In fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. It all left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
