I saw a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits for this movie are exactly the same as Dark Star, so I guess it was an alternative title. Dark Talon was not as close as fun as everyone else here says. The actor was a lame, editing editor and generally stupid. In the beginning, there is an annoying 1970s trucking song called "Benson, Arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. The reason is about a small crew of an interstellar bomber who is walking around bombardments that are unstable. The bombs are sentient and react to humans. The mandatory disaster interferes with communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew members goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb, which has no meaning. The movie I saw was made over an hour and a half, with advertisements thrown in, so I suppose Dark Talon is an excessive version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> Alien is an inflatable redball spray painted with a pair of monster hands on which it goes. It was stupid and convincing as a foreigner. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that John Carpenter had a hand in this. His other films were so much better.
