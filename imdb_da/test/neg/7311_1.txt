This movie was bad. I think Elton (or is it Mike) Wong starred in it. Still, it was Wong who didn't have the stupid laugh and looks meaner. He plays a man who is hit over his head and suffers brain damage. He recovers and gets revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this movie, but he doesn't get much to do. But what little does he seem to do <br /> <br /> other pale in comparison. Also, the film has some cheesy rubber hay, which the Wong guy controls. This movie is not worth renting or buying.
