Historically awful. Almost an exact moment in 4 hours of ridicule. One cannot keep an eye on the discrepancies while looking. As with all tracks and archived movies, no one has trouble asking for track consultants. Events and techniques not created for the next century are shown. From the shootings of joggers 400 meters to the very obese actor exhibiting the high jump and the long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about the track to be mildly entertained. Probably thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just before the Olympics.
