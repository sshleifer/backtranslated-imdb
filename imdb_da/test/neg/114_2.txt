I saw Mogul Video VHS of this. It's another of the old 1980s distributors whose catalog I wish I had! <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. Although it was retitled "Do not look at the attic", the most important admonition is repeated in this, "Do not go to the villa." Just getting through the villa is a bad idea. A sign does not go into the ceiling until an hour in the movie, and it should actually have done so earlier because of what is taught there. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in Turin, Italy in the 1950s. Two men are fighting, and a woman tells them that the villa makes them do it. A man kills the other, so regrets it, and the woman pulls the knife out and sticks it with it. She flies from the villa, and after she's gone, a chair goes by itself (what's the point?), But when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and pulls it into the ground. <br /> <br /> From there, it's thirty years later. There is a seance that appears suddenly and doesn't seem to have anything to do with the movie. The women's children from the proletogen inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men from the prologue seems to resume as another character as well. She is haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, because if they do not use it, they will lose it. People die. A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The end is pretty bad. Why was the family cursed? An unfortunate boring movie. <br /> <br /> There is an entertaining small print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads, "The scenes depicted on this packaging may be the artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from movies. . " In this case, the box cover is an illustration that more or less accurately shows the aforementioned woman drawn underground scene, although there are two hands and the woman is different. It is true that the cover has nothing to do with the film. I also remember seeing a reviewer who had a poor film prediction scale, where illustrations of illustrations on the cover instead of pictures got at least one point to it.
