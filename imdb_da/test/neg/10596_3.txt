The DVD sleeve explains the premise: "Three problem teens are in prison" and are "set to make time until Captain Greer offers them a deal to work for him - undercover". The movie opens with definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad" so you don't have to look them up in the dictionary. For a visual definition of "Cool", search for images of the original triangle: Michael Cole (like Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (like Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (like Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> A variety. A white one. A blonde. The three that make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's "The Mod Squad" are twenty-two: Claire Danes (like Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (like Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (like Linc Hayes). They cannot do much with the given material. Mr. Ribisis depiction is the most "far out", which means he digs the most from the original characterization. Ms. Danes romance Josh Brolin (like Billy Waites), who looks as if he could be in a re-enactment of "Marcus Welby, MD". You won't believe Michael Lerner is dancing with Mr. Epps 'Linc'. He explains, "I'm not an adventure, I just like to dance!" and requests, "Spin me!" <br /> <br /> *** Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
