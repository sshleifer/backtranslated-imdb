What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and most unused throughout. Jon Lovitz was very gentle but meaningless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me, or Kari Wuhrer can hardly act in this. <br /> <br /> The story was rather non-existent and truly incoherent. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the signs to the events that occurred. Like the surf "dudes" give up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about you never saw them surf once !! The setup for some scenes took too long with not enough pay-off to make us give a shame. Nothing in this "movie" really felt true or genuine. The only good things I can say is some (very little) of the scene was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting. Don't look here when there are so many better meaningless movies out there.
