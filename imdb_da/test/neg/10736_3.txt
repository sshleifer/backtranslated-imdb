I think this movie lacks so much substance, it's not even worth discussing. In the first place, the package is really disgusting. Especially stereotype films and photography. Certainly, Joe Dante's movie style was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers", I mean the imaginative and visual beautiful story of a Spielberg wunderkind (I really loved these movies), but in "Homecoming" it was a complete failure. Attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures are simply not comparable to zombie invasions (dead, smelly, rat creatures trying to kill the living - for no logical reason just because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie flicks are characteristic of ordinary, direct, unconventional and brutal filmography. Nothing to see in Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, a cruel exploitation of the "older brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and bad plays. And by the way, "Homecoming" is neither scary nor gory - and even less entertaining. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film of the decade of their birth - the late 60s / early 70s - used to be revolutionary, provocative (especially through its cruel explicit content) and a subtle social critic. The original Zombie movie was actually a midnight movie called "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). One was a low budget film that covered so many controversial themes, it's hard to mention them all: a visual style of Hitchcock / Raimi, the American lifestyle of the 70s, political seclusion, the forthcoming breakthrough of the human rights of the black people and the even more forthcoming racism as a result of the conservative Americans (remember the shooting of the black protagonist at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and would like to learn more about the most important, I recommend you "Midnight Movie: From Margin to Mainstream". <br /> <br /> Then remove "Homecoming" and even see Romero's "Land of the Death".
