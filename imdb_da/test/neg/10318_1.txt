I don't know how this DVD came into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of those "3 for £ 20" deals on a high street store. The case is not worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! Having invested heavily in it, I felt obliged to see it to the end to make sure it was just as bad all the way through - and it was. The dialogue was horrible, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what hell was going on despite having read synopsis), the camera work was uneven and hopeless, the play was wood (not helped by the dialogue). <br /> <br /> In fact, there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. She should get her agent to buy all the rights to it and then bury it ASAP. As a last fun example of the instructor's unwieldy, there was a scene where the young leader speaks to his father's ex-army sidekick while driving. This was the clearest dialogue in the movie - no motor noise at all! I am looking forward to motor-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond to British cars!
