I have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time, read the biography, looked at the offers and saw Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the film, she seems to be a shy and a pretty much lonely (except a girl friend). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. She was outgoing and kind. She had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Kar's attempt at a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she saw a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she went to her hotel room. Also, Karen took pills to increase her thyroid gland so she could lose weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist didn't recommend her too. Karen's husband in the movie is also called Bob Knight, but in reality Tom Burris was called. Also, Karen was not separated from Tom, but only separated. Karen was to sign the divorce papers the day she died. Agnes also found Karen naked in the closet's unconsciousness, unlike in the film, where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. It was the only thing I would recommend seeing it.
