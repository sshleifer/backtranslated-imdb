Petes Meteor. I have seen this referred to as "authentic" and a "gem". I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> It was apparently known as Mike Myer's first dramatic role. Unfortunately, it had to be this movie. The first thing you notice that Petes Meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of small subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphans Mickey lives with her younger brother and sister with their grandmother. A meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. In spite of the movie's title, Mickey is the one who claims the meteor, and "the bigline" doesn't actually have much to do with the meteor in any form or form. From here, several other signs and subplots are laid out. But as I said before, they don't go anywhere. Things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty quickly when Pete (Mike Myers) is introduced and begins to play a role. Micky blames him for his parents' death, even though we never really told what happened or why. Hugh has romantic problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination. And Pete's drug-related past starts catching up with him and temporarily pulls his own boyfriend and the rest of the throw into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him. This seems to be the most important plot until you realize that it doesn't even have a role before halfway through the movie, making everything else feel like a pointless filler. Hugh's girl problems, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what do they have on earth to do with this? Little. <br /> <br /> So the 'plot' is uneven and half of it is meaningless. But a good piece of character can save it, right? Keywords: good. Most characters are terribly unlikely people, most of whom would like to see death terribly. At least I know I wanted to. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the protagonist, which is a really bad move when you see him in action. He is one of the WORST small children I have seen in a movie, with an extremely poor attitude problem. He 'borrows' a car, harasses and speaks to Hugh (an adult) Sunday to take the meteor, actually trying to burn a man's house when he does not come and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. You think a child like this is on his way to the prison house. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets what comes to him. I'm not sure when to be sympathetic to his character, for he is always a scary little brat. He is the lead of his brother and sister, so they predictably end up taking and sitting down and just watching what he does. Amazingly, they have pushed back so far that I can't even remember their names. They can't even be there. <br /> <br /> Your grandmother is basically a borderline alcoholic. She tends to be as uncomfortable to Hugh as Mickey, and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil glares when she doesn't knock down liquids and drink stupidly. It's pretty ridiculous when you consider that she should take care of three children. Her alcohol problems are never really addressed, even though she uses the movie from time to time. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few similar characters in the movie, but it is only because he is the punch bag of most characters and takes their clutter without giving it back. The kids treat him nastily, but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do good things with them. He has a taxi driver's boyfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, trying to leave him several times in the movie when he goes out in his cosmic lingo or does something to prove he is not exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (fortunately). <br /> <br /> There is Mike Myers like Pete. Pete, despite the only solid purpose and plot in the film, is extremely underutilized and does not play any role until the second half. It is unfortunate that Myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete gets screen time, half just Myers runs through dark alleys and hides in small corners. And even though he was the only real point on this movie when his plot line brings the film to a seal, it is a strange and inexplicable conclusion that has all the characters laughing at a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie does You doubt if they were just in the movie you are just watching. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in Pete's meteor is Mike Myer's role as Pete, and that is if you can wade through this inconsistent root long enough without cheating on another person due to the highly unlikely signs and non-existing plot line. No, sir, I didn't like this at all.
