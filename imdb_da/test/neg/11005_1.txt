I went into this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to download a movie and my friend returned with this. I promised him that I would not laugh at his election, but within the first five minutes I told him I should take my pledge back. We kept an eye on hope that it would be better, but no; a continuous rape followed. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst ever committed to film, and deserves a place on the IMDb Bottom 100. I really don't know how it was distributed. The lighting was poor. I've seen better action in primary school games. There is really nothing positive to say about it.
