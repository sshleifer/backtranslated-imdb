If there was an EPA for movies, this movie would get their most sincere approval. If we all regained our "stuff" to this extent, we would never run out of anything. <br /> <br /> Funny how I was reminded of this movie when I first saw Starwars I: Phantom Menace. At least Lucas has not reused his old recordings. <br /> <br /> This is a dud. But it's a good dud. Sweet in spots (I liked when the child said "marvelous stones"). And if you like explosions (even recycled), you get your fill. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a blatant "no budget" movie, it's pretty good. Action is weak, but there is a slight characterization here and there. The story is predictable, but will guide you anyway. <br /> <br /> This is an "all chases the kid" type of movie that will most likely appeal to the younger audience. I gave this one out of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug up my old VHS copy of this movie. I don't think it's on DVD.
