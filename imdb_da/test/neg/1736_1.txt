The only people I would recommend this movie to are both blind and deaf, though I'm sure a sadomasochist would get a kick out of it. This movie had nothing; no action, horrible music, terrible script - only the power to suck any happiness from your soul. You may wonder now why or even how I managed to sit through the hour and a half of purity, and it is honestly a difficult concept for myself. First of all, I had to get up and down as the movie progressed as I found it extremely difficult to get comfortable. Second, I have only done so without rubbing my own arm to get something to kill me by calling friends for moral support, as the plot became particularly slow. The problem was that it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after thirty minutes of opening, and that was a fatal error on my behalf. I usually like movies to leave you with something at the end, but all this happened was to take ..... For your sake, don't see this movie.
