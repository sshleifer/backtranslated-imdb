This is my opinion of this film, expressed in its dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can't say that this movie is a bad moment, but I don't enjoy it either. <br /> <br /> First, I was simply indifferent and couldn't think of the monkey world. Although make-up is very realistic, the constant screaming was annoying. Perhaps the film has changed monkeys to cats, and it is a cult movie for me compared to my feelings of the latter. The other part is more interesting with the talent and freshness of beginners (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is located in a large British mansion: no matter how luxurious it is, it was like a prison for me. Finally, could it be a good fit of Burroughs' story of Tarzan? I do not know that I have never read the book (or seen Disney) :. In conclusion, I do not have good moments to remember, so a view would be enough for me. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "Overture" at the beginning ... What is the meaning? Only the director knows.
