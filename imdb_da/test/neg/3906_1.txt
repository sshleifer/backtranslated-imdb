I saw this movie partly because of some positive comments here on IMDb. Upon request, I had the 90 minutes of my life back, I feel it is my duty to come here myself and say ... Please don't bother to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I can't argue with the actors' efforts - they did what they could give the material, but that material is terrible. The pace was deadly - slow, meandering, and you saw about an hour away, and it took forever to happen. The dialogue was boring, meaningless, not fun at all. The characters were all completely unsympathetic. And the cinematography was in my opinion very low quality - clich√© of "characters using home video device!" was used to very bad effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a cool person. Don't let it suck you to waste your time on this movie.
