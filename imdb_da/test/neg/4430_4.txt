This tattooed dramatization scamily scrambles through the plot of Dickens' wonderful book, which replaces the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior sites of drawings. Of course, it is not the actors and production team's fault that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to ask the question of doing this in the first place when there is no time or money to do it justice. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is far too gentle at first, making his transformation lack power, and it is not helped by lack of reaction from him while he looks at the visions. The other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley), to non-committal (Bernard Lee) to think they are forgetting their lines (John Le Mesurier). It doesn't even give points for effort to be honest.
