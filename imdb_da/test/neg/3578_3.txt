Good actors, good director, well acted, well directed but ... Where's the movie? Do they have a script or just improvised it all? At least, it's a short length movie (only 80 minutes, including credits). Nothing seems to happen in this movie, nothing at all. A few retailers trapped in small time problems, but you never get a clue what is happening, and even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie. Tones of "f *** 's" and "motherf *****", but nothing else ... <br /> <br /> For those people who love Abel Ferrara's movies as The Funeral, 'The Funeral' R Xmas will be a big disappointment as it has been for me. What was he thinking about? Does he really think it was a good movie? And if he didn't, why did he do it?
