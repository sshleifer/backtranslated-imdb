A blind person could have shot this movie better ... seriously! The director is clearly a beginner. He must be Dennis Hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie. I felt so embarrassed by Dennis. <br /> <br /> To John, the director ... PLEASE retire from correction. Your contribution is not necessary or desired. The medium of the film is stronger without you. You are horrible to lead. Stick to collapse for groceries or something. <br /> <br /> This movie must have bypassed "straight to video" and gone "striaght to the trash." I'm a stupid person to have seen this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU RESPECT YOU AND RESPONSIBILITY ARTFORM OF MOVIE!
