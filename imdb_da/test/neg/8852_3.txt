I was so excited to finally see "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon and I must say I was totally disappointed. Maybe I think I was too hyped up. I had expectations from her fans who simply couldn't be met. Having loved other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart. The story was slow, painful. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I also love the stable, growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters". "Pulse" offered a bit from either spectrum, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Along with the inertia of the plot, it was also very confused. I didn't have a clue why the signs did what they did and how they did would help their problem. It seemed as if the director spat off the plot in a sentence or two, and the rest was improvised from our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a rather difficult to follow plot line, "Pulse" clears very little at the end and lets me feel frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' efforts. My final statement about the plot was its inconsistency. First, it seemed that the story was about the ghost world overcrowded, and their medium of escape is the Internet. It's a damn original idea. I like that. But as the plot drones on, plot holes and inexplicable events that rear their heads, it seems that the director switched to an apocalyptic story (as seen at the end), which has just not been clear enough to be accomplished. <br /> <br /> I am aware of the brittleness of the shoots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel gloomy and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shady surroundings. I will admit that there was some sense of surrealism with the movie, but it may just have been my attention to swing in and out. The action of some of the characters is also a little ridiculous, and perhaps, if I was more excited about the story, I would have been able to suspend more disbelief, but I was also not motivated by any of the characters. As I mentioned earlier, the logic behind what certain characters did was absent and contributed to the complexity of the plot. Perhaps it was a result of the plot's inconsistency that the characters do questionable things. To be honest, I'm not really worried. <br /> <br /> The action was decent. Absolutely nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible either. No irregularities to mention on either side of brilliant or plain horrible. <br /> <br /> Now I stop throwing so sour and mentioning that there were a handful of scary moments. One at the end especially that if there was more like it all, I would have enjoyed this movie (almost) completely. I thought that when the website was displayed, it was rather disturbing as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two protagonists face. The things that happened between these creepy run-ins were just too noisy, confusing and "WTF" for me to really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Now for something related to the DVD itself ... Magnolia's release of "Pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. They are not told at the right time by the character's speech. It may sound nit-picking, but it did bother me a little and it can disturb some others. I think it's the only North American release of the movie, even if you either have to cope or watch double (NEVER WAIT DUBBING !!!) I tried to like the movie, I really did. I wanted this movie to live up to the hype ... but unfortunately it fell flat for me. If you're looking for other scary Asian cinemas, I recommend you "Audition", "Shutter", "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Strange Circus" and "Marebito" - all of which are more my pallet.
