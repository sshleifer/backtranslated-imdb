I saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I see it, I can't help but cry. This version was (of course) a set that 1959 was, but there were so many errors in layout. Spiral? Goods that did not exist during that period existed in the film. Doris Roberts, sad to say, can't play drama, she's a comic actress, and it won't change. James Coco was a terrible Mr. From Daan and Mr. Dussel looked like a college professor for me, rather than the dentist he was going to play. In the original movie, Anne walked "Gauntlet" to come to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a moment. In this crappy remake, she took her under 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct ... This remake is just that, a remake. What did the instructor think about putting comic actors into a drama role as such. I'm sorry, but James Coco can't play drama. Max .. Schell was better in Deep Impact saw this movie. The naughty Miss Frank was just as sharp, I couldn't stand her. Referral to and comparison with the 1959 edition, I like her better, she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars, I give this remake 3. Don't waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
