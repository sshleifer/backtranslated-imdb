It is unfortunate that between this movie, in the Valley of Elah, Lions for Lambs and Home of the Brave, everyone seems to be based on common stereotypes about veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Spraying, fighting, short fuses, broken marriages, boys rushing out and digging a fox hole in their yard when they are full, etc. <br /> <br /> Has it happened - yes, but not as often as you would think after seeing any of these movies. I find it unfortunate that these directors / producers / authors choose to paint their axes against the political establishment by depicting soldiers in such an atypical way. In this particular movie, Kimberly Peirce did not even throw a leg on us, like showing the new children born while a family member was deployed, or the child who grew up in some ghettos who now can afford college thanks to GI Bill, or the couple who can afford a house or start a new business, earns their citizenship, etc. etc. Instead, we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this movie will only show you the bad side. /> <br /> A few issues with the movie itself: 1) Someone turned up by putting Phillippe in front of a Bronze Star with V after he led his team in a tight street after being carried by a gun in a taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes it happens. 2) The thieves did not have any towers, so we should believe that it was near the beginning of the war, but every soldier and their brother have an ACOG and every possible attachment to their M4? sorry, don't believe it 3) Timothy Olyphant as a supreme colonel? It's hard to believe, but I've just checked one he was 40 in May, so the timing is not too low. 4) He beats two soldiers to escape being sent to prison after saying he would not return to Iraq (after learning that he was the stop-unloaded). So he is a refugee. So when he finally turns to the end and they take him back, does he hold his rank and use the same entity? Sorry, don't think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as a huge stereotype of the army and infantry. Making some of the events portrayed in this movie randomly with some soldiers, yes. But in this movie you get almost all stereotypes in about 100 minutes, and it really is just not for most soldiers returning. I wish the director had made a point of doing some better research instead of starting with his agenda and then making a movie. <br /> <br /> Of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more of a comment on the sad state of Generation Y + than it is about the war in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to watch this movie wait for cable or Netflix it, do not pay cash directly to rent it.
