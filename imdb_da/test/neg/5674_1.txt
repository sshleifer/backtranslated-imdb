This show is based on the concept of loud + unpleasant + repetition = fun. The comic writing is non-existent, I actually face serious consequences even by comparing it to any kind of entertainment. Here is the premise. Two girls accidentally get their postings on the internet, and hilarity follows their first success, considering the idea of ​​making a webcast to show their glimpses. <br /> <br /> OK, so where do I start? Let's start with the laugh, it is often used, but never a successful reminder that we should look at the audience. According to folley guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should all lose loads in our pants because of the humor's gleam placed before us. Laughter track goes seriously every few seconds. It seems enough that Scooby-Doo for the king of laughter jumps over. <br /> <br /> Face-shout-at-the-top-of-our-lungs-the-craziest-grouping-of-words-to-seem-stupid tricks are also employed with little to no success. Whoa and let's not forget to create new words to sound funny trick. It is web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... Finally the action. I can't quite complain here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but it should and can be corrected by good professional help. Because of inexperience, nick should help the actors define their craft. Instead, on the usual nick mode, players are placed in front of the camera and told "action". As is usually the case, robot recitation of lines, missing timing and overall epic error. <br /> <br /> The lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be fun. Do not waste your time. This show is diminishing for all of humanity
