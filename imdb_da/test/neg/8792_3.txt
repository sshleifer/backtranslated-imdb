It is painfully clear that all the work in this film was aimed at cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and skilled, but they all seemed out of place and it was not safe to have an amateur director. History is a very common Geisha story, and characters appeared very inconsistent, making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine. <br /> <br /> This movie is the theme of "modern prostitution", but it was still annoying how Tsuchiya Anna's protagonist continued to speak as a female motorcycle gang member, while everyone else spoke in ancient Japanese fitting to this setting. This movie has very beautiful vibrant colors that resemble Zhang Yimou's "Hero", but viewers can easily tell it's filmed in a cheap, elaborate set. <br /> <br /> The two sequences of Shiina Ringo's action songs were really nice in the middle of the movie. I really don't really like her music before, but they fit perfectly into this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure as a film director, she has great potential in PV production (music video). I think the story felt very common, because the director did not focus on character development, and because Tsuchiya Anna's convincing acts like an Oiran. Had this movie been directed by a well-known Jidaigeki director with any other known actress in Japan, it would have had the potential to become a masterpiece.
