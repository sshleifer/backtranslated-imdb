The frustrating thing about a movie like this, with a true potential for greatness, is that it almost enjoys being heavy-handed. We are talking about allegory, metaphor ... but the truth is that there is no one to circumvent that there is absolutely no plot or a real character. <br /> <br /> At some point we know most who the people are ... even though we never understand where to go. The pure pretentiousness carried me down every time I tried to understand a truth in this movie. Call it beautiful, big and awesome ... I just call it "cheat". All style and no fabric. Sure, it's a matter of taste ... but I would never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes over Jean Cocteau or Renoir's spiritual clarity. But if it works for you, I'm all for it. Art is a personal thing, I think.
