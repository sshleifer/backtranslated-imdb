A "40 foot" giant mutant octopus with five tentacles, razor fangs and the ability to reproduce its own cells terrorizes a small Florida town. Various marine biologists, doctors and police plot to kill it. Meanwhile, a human monster called Miller offs people who discover "Devilfish" is a man-made creation used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a female scientist, confuses her, drowns her in the bathtub, throws on a hair dryer and shakes her panties out of her dead body! <br /> <br /> Lots of fake alarms are set when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob sat on a high technology (high technology for 1984, anyway) "Seaquarium" boat to catch the creature, often seen in Close-up or hilarious obvious accelerated movie to seem more threatening. And only fire can destroy it, leading to a flamethrower-armed pose vs. aquatic animal finale. <br /> <br /> This JAWS deposit is pretty pretty (except for a legless corpse and a takeoff), but it can be seen and the benefits of an excellent Antony Barrymore score and a decent (again, for 1984) monster design. Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Result: 4 out of 10
