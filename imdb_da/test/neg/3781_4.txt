It is really easy to bowl, roast, flay and otherwise burn this movie for all its abundant mistakes. It was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community; it shows! Sure, I could examine the script, which is just ridiculous. A monster created from the garbage in a growing California town begins to eat garbage and take trash cans all over the city. Soon, this large animal with wings will no less destroy buildings and even play the "beauty and beast" action with a young high school girl. Fortunately for her, there is a gang of boys, her former boyfriend named "The Penguin", and the city drowned out to help her. The direction is horrible, the production just appreciates horribly, the acting non-existent, and the pace slow. The film is hard to sit through - period. But that being said, it's also a miracle of a movie when you consider that this thing was designed by a whole community. You can see all the collective efforts of the actors, the actual mayor and the actual firefighters and police officers, to the area shots used. I was also really amazed at all the local businesses that were credited at the end of the movie, helping to fund or somehow contribute to the movie. When you look at the movie from that perspective, it is actually a performance. I didn't know anything about it until I sat down and looked at it. Now that I've found out about it, I'm impressed. But make no mistake - I have no ... NO ... want to sit through it again.
