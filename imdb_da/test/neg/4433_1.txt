Calling this movie is a disaster an understatement. I don't even know where to start! I have questions and many of them. I want to know who is thinking about this script? Who gave them money to make this movie? Who was responsible for casting and costuming? They should all be sued! I saw this movie in the catalog of my local library and I thought "Hey! Great!" I had just seen the two FOG films that Hollywood had produced and then realized that Bollywood had a version. Unknown to me that it would turn out to be a total and complete crap party! <br /> <br /> The Dhund Fog is a four-friend movie (actually just one of them, but you should know there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by India's 1st Wife World, Aditi Govitrikes) and the director save no expense by letting you know. The script even claims that she (the character's name is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai's eyes, Kareena Kapoor's lips and Rani Mukherjee's hair. You are welcome to barf if you want, at least at this time you have not seen the movie, as opposed to poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> Anyway, Simran receives a death threat one day from one of the participants' uncle who tells her to get out of the competition so his niece would have a better chance of winning, but Simrans girlfriend does not allow her to do this, and thus she participates in the festival and wins, causing her former college chamber friend Tanya to come after her crack cocaine sniffing uncle, but with the help of her cousin Kajal, Simran drowns the culprit and they use both girlfriends in the job of getting rid of the body. It's hard, but they eventually do it. <br /> <br /> In a scene borrowing from Hollywood's movie Diabolique, the pool where the dead body is hidden, is only drained to reveal that the body is missing, and this begins a federation of Whodunit and Where-is-it? When the movie is over, the movie's success steals scenes from 'I know what you did last summer I still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder, she wrote epi sweet and not to m ention, Columbo and Scooby Doo '! Shameless, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and problems in the movie include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. A beautifully dressed Simran answers phone calls three times from her wild killer, the camera shows her that the phone falls away from the hook, but the phone is able to ring again every time and she picks it up to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Tanya is trying to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times more beautiful, did not attempt suicide as she did not win Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, the children who come to collect the ball that has fallen into the pool will disappear gently as soon as the police arrive. And the ball also disappears. <br /> <br /> 4. Clich√© blue contact lenses from the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, but when his body flattens again, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one who dies in the movie is mourned (strange, especially for Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the dirty creepy pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously turns the pool into Olympic size and is clean and clear as day. <br /> <br /> 7. Sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm penetrated song and dance number about the age. It would have been cool for some bachelor parties, but they celebrated the adventures of Simran! Hi!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal cannot dance or Lip Synch properly. But don't be blamed on them, just accept that there was no choreographer for dance number. 9. Nothing in the movie was choreographed, it was as if they just told the actors to show up and do anything. <br /> <br /> 10. The movie played out as if there was no script. Either that or the director was tall and full when he filmed this junk! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's picture was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested, but she receives death threats and never asks to warn the police. <br /> <br /> Just to name a few of course. This movie was a painful experience for me and I advise everyone to skip it in all necessary and possible ways. Bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film making.
