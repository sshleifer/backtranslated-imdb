Dear Mr Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know to what extent I am writing this letter to you. I am a never-ending-man-made Amitabh Bachchan fan who has put himself through his cock-hunting action in Jaadugar. I also require some important names in The Godfather fan club after seeing the Coppola classic several times than you have supplied flops from your factory. And of course I have been a great admirer of you right from the time you had Nagarjuna wrapped the bike chain around his bones in Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced Sarkar and called it, you went to Godfather, everyone wanted to know was the date the first look would be out, Sunday promoter would go out, Friday the movie would be released. It was pure wish fulfillment in the workplace, knowing that you, and not someone floating between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the Tulip Gardens in Amsterdam, had taken on the task of restoring the Puzo pages to the Bollywood big screen. <br /> <br /> Your throw could not have been more you? work for the first time with the legend and support Abhishek as his son, giving Kay Kay a role he has earned for years, bringing back forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar and picking complete actors like Katrina and Tanishaa to join the list? ? Before July 1, you had made Sarkar the most sought after movie ever for any godfather freak who worshiped Bachchan. <br /> <br /> The opening credits highlighted the hope that your amazing sepia-toned promos on the telly had turned on. But now you marked Sarkar your tribute to Godfather instead of the word "inspired" that you had used all the time. You probably don't want the two creations to be compared, but when the medium is the same, a Kaante will be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a city on fire. <br /> <br /> Also, when your first and last sequences ?? heart of any manuscript treatment ?? is about establishing and transferring power, you can't keep Nagares and Corleones apart, even if you replace the American mafia, you move with the Maharashtris political power game. <br /> <br /> But you're wrong. Hot ?? You wanted to show Amitabh in his 70's avatar, which rustled up the salim-Javed pens. You wanted him to fool around bigger than life. You wanted him to be his own brand (o). So how could you steal the voice in the name of using silence? How could you keep him rooted in his chair in search of interesting camera angles? How could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature, the two things that made his B so great? Coppola's godfather companion Gordon Willis masked Brando's eyes throughout the film because it didn't have the power to match the appalling husky voice or the sudden snap of the fingers. But you tried to repeat the Malik action from your own company. But Bachchan is no Ajay Devgan ?? his forte is not in the stagnant stare and the stifling silence. You have made the man look like a comatose patient reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth the predictable lineages. Because it's Agneepath there, any Saturday. Which Bachchan fan would go and watch Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder from under his nose in the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? Which Amitabh aficionado would go see him focus on achaar and carom, in a movie talking about power with a capital P in the promotions? We can't handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement! You don't even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son would kill him. Give me the old school-only-on-Bachchan style, any Saturday. Kudos to you of course to make an actor from Abhishek, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. You also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run as well as his father. Even in the short prison sequence, you really make the bachchans out of the text, a chance Shaad missed in Bunty Aur Babli. Want the movie to have been a more dangerous son's story than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters that appear as the ad windows on the Internet. <br /> <br /> You also let the women more into the script than Puzo and Coppola over and over again, you deserve all the Brownie points to squeeze them in so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle, Tanishaa gracious as the love girl, Katrina a revelation that Abhishek's confused lover and Rukhsar silence speaks volumes. But the subplot is not a classic remake. When your free-flowing camera tries to get each frame to see hats and your high background score irritates incessantly, we are being reminded that we are in a factory. Well, maybe not a Nino Rota score, but Sarkar certainly deserved better than those Govinda, Govinda Chants and uncalled-for flute interludes. <br /> <br /> Mr Varma, some of your Factory Directors, tell me that you are involved in each project, from monitoring the shooting plans to monitoring the editing sessions. Perhaps in the middle of all the different storyboards, the Bhiku Matre Scream is subdued by the Subhash Nagare silence. Maybe you should bring the shutters down to the factory and work on a single homemade product. Otherwise, your products will remain products, use and throw, not treasure. And movie buffs like me, for whom there are no hits and flops, only good cinema, would rather choose a movie without the Factory finish, any Saturday.
