Don Wilson stars as a policeman enjoying the occasional virtual reality fighting game, but it goes wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game, okay, in fact, they make the cybersex models prototype but the biggest evil guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people, and now the only man who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who in the meantime falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, with all the things that were considered, my biggest confusion was trying to understand whether the people were moving from virtual reality land, were robots, people, cyborgs, or just some unidentified computer program. It does not matter as it is only an excuse to see one of the worst actors ever slaughtering dialogue as if he were running a deli. Don Wilson's complete lack of charisma is the movie's biggest mistake as you just don't like the guy, he's too good-good, his voice is too loud and doesn't look very impressive in the action sequences. What saves this drill feast from my lowest rating is Athenia Massey, who looks super hot in high cut outfits and who occasionally gets naked. Also on board is Loren Avedon (A good martial arts), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the bad guy's main voice, but their efforts are in vain as they are all hidden by Wilson's very bad acting. Another mistake, which is the movie's biggest mistake, is lack of action when we are asked to see the story unfold, but apart from Massey's nudity and perhaps some unintentional rides due to ridiculously convincing action, there really is nothing of interest. This also extends to the action sequences, which are flat choreographed, poorly directed and completely drained by any voltage. Make it practically unmatched. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
