Following his role in the fine captain SEVEN THIEVES (1960) - which I have seen several years back - Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing older criminal mastermind types (except the odd juicy role as in CINCINNATI KID [1965] ). I had previously seen the very good "Euro-Cult" effort GRAND SLAM (1967), and besides this, I have another two similar titles from Italy to check - one of which was led by upcoming goremeister Lucio Fulci! Yet it is such international production - with American and Italian actors and a British director - widespread in the 1960s; it is harmless and easy in itself, but hardly memorable and definitely overlapped - especially since buying finance for the powerful equipment required for the hoist (such as a hearth tank and a plane!), the gang involved must pull one series of minor thefts first. <br/> <br /> The band is, of course, an incompetent mass led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo boyfriend (Raquel Welch) - the others are a "pacifist" black man, an eternally hungry Italian, and a smaller Englishman . They are trying to induce a former gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn their happiness on them unless he is poor ... but under the direction of "Professor" Robinson, he suggests instead a caper on platinum of $ 5 million! Needless to say, the band members do not trust each other (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica to get the name of their fence in Morocco - where to retire after the robbery), or otherwise bungle the job (ordered to quit a restaurant, the Italian cannot resist sitting at the table and ordering a multilingual meal for himself!). Under the surprise of similar mistakes, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days - but apparently maintaining a gas station, it turns out the owner is a nephew to him and he just asked to borrow some money! <br /> <br /> The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, 'takes' the train carrying platinum, Wagner kidnapped pilot Victor Spinetti and his aircraft. When the job is finished, he intends to cross De Sica - but neither his partners nor Welch are willing to go along with this, so he has to relate. From the time the crime did not pay, the gang goes to lose all their stash in the air when accidentally launching the plane's bombing doors.
