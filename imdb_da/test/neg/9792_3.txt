It is impossible to make a movie based on such a book as "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostojevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great instructor, but that movie is at a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie was the end. Well, let's think about the book. Finally, we have the "guilty" Dimitrij Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. In the end, Dostoevsky's famous epilogues, friends and family make a plan to save him. But that's it ... and now the film takes two more steps and shows us an illusion that ends in flight from Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). right from the moral point, I'm sure Dostoevsky would end the book with an open end because one side he's not guilty of (Smerjakov is the real killer) and then he must be a free man. But on the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him, so he has decided to commit the crime ... it's a moral dilemma and then the following point is an open end ... yes for reality it's just not full open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner like Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters play in a good performance, which we should expect from such amazing actors ... Of course, an excellent performance by Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think there are not many players who can play this part in a better way. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning: This book is not adaptable. It should never be a movie in two hours, it is impossible. I think there are some 'longer movies', so maybe they can do the right thing ... But I just think this book can't be customized. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <<br /> <br /> A point to amazing instructor Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a yul Bryner's amazing performance. Finally: A point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostoevsky
