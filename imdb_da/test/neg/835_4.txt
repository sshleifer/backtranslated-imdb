Any lump can play (2 out of 5 stars) Completely routine "spaghetti western" starring the guy who used to play "Kookie" on the "77 Sunset Strip". The reason is somewhat overdue nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various weapons of questionable motivation trying to track it down. This is one of the "light hearted" Western ... which means lots of attempts at "comedy" ... and some really terrible music during most of the action sequences (you can tell this is not Ennio Morricones work). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter called "Stranger" ... but he doesn't leave much of an impression ... he just doesn't have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who is able to do much with a sparsely written character. The end is a complete homage / parody of the end of "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" ... although it is hardly fun enough to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes ... which features actors pattern after Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and another (Should he be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not quite clear ...) confronted by stranger It's an entertaining in-joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados ... but I imagine no one else would see the point.
