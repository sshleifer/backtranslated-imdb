I want all mockumentaries and horror spoofs to go away. If you want to investigate loch ness .. do it for right. Enough of the bull ****. The same with horror and sci-fi. If you are going to make a movie and it should be scary. Make it scary .. not fun. I hate when I watch a horror movie and the character fights for their lives (or runs or whatever .. their lives are at stake) and they are breaking jokes. This never happens .. where have all the good directors gone? I think horror and sci-fi have really gone down the pipe since the 70's. I long for the days when a scarecrow was scary. This "scary movie" is the shed for the birds. This movie is also for the birds. If you really want to see a good study or serious talk ... don't expect it in this video.
