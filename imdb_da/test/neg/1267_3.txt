The film is powerful as a political statement of extraordinary surrender, torture and the war on terror policy. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you can't read more than this point. <br /> <br /> Several questions have been raised by this movie. First of all, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation as to why the NSA decided to get him to pick up and do it in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is, the film does not seem to give one, and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfactory to me. It is good and good to comment on whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we take it to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps we were well-educated to resist up to a certain time and then pretend to break down and give answers that may turn out to be wrong with some research, thus tending to lead tortures to believe they had tortured an innocent man to confess without being guilty. However, there is nothing in the film that proves he is also guilty. <br /> <br /> The various other loose ends out there are: 1. Then a rogue CIA agent released and flown home. What prevents NSA from retrieving him? A little mention in the Washington Post? Give me a break here ... If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what will Corinne Whitman fear? 2. If the NSA has tracked which phone numbers are being called by whom, why could they not listen to any of the calls to find out if something subordinate is being discussed? 3. The reason is even more stupid anyway. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would carry out his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid mobile phone line, not on one that can be traced back to him and his house. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is about tearing the viewers' heart strings by displaying graphic and free torture scenes. But when you think of it with more depth, there is no content in this movie, just lots of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what, that's it? !!!" at the end of the movie.
