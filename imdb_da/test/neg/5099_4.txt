As indicated above, I was ultimately unimpressed with this movie. It is great to look at, the landscape is lush, but the details of the story, especially the characters, are incredible. Movies do not have to be credible, but movies like this, with a political edge and social comments. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again movies like this should not be making casting decisions based solely on box office draw. This is quite the case with Sutherland, who is honestly rubbish like Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the greatest trap of all, his accent is his achievement, and we end up with an Irish caricature without personality outside his nationality. I find it incredible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. All in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest in quality, and when you try to be Mission, this kind of thing destroys your chances of success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents, there were a few more issues, one being the striking modernity of the boy's accent, which acted to eliminate the feeling of being transported to another time. More surprisingly, Samantha Morton's very high Irish accent was the least variable. Her voice swung between strong north and soft south, even in voice-overs, where I would have expected such inconsistencies to be retrieved. <br /> <br /> But these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of Sarah. She never works at home with the English, and almost instantly at home with her son and tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she offered , just seems like a no-brainer. Perhaps much has been lost in editing, maybe it was supposed to be a movie of three hours or a mini-series, where these things could have been fleshed out, but I can only judge what I have seen. <br /> <br /> Now, the biggest problem is that Sarah's (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that her love for him is not transmitted in any way until she has to choose between him and her son, the conflict she is going through at this time was honestly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed. This movie didn't work for me at all, but it's really okay to look at, you really don't want to see anything more stunning about scenery, there are some good ideas and my wife liked it.
