I purchased this $ 1.99 rental yield from Hollywood and overpaid. I didn't expect much, but thought it would be something to fall asleep at least. I quickly noted the very weak story, the gross overactive of all (no one speaks like that, except in cartoons), and the seemingly easy-make-it-up-we-go-along direction. I know the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed about it, and I'm sure it didn't help any career. as for this 35-year film movie, it has now given a clear answer to the worst movie-you have ever seen the question. <br /> <br />
