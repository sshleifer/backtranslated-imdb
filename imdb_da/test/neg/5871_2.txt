This is one of the movies you find when you are late and only have a basic cable. It's hard to believe that this movie was made in '95, as it looks like something out of the late 80's. Plucky youngsters with varied home problems face a demented ice cream man who is on a mission to make the best taste ever: Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely demented and is only scary in how scary and absolutely ridiculous it is. In fact, the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home. The fact that these children have no escape from their silent suburbs makes any casual loony loose in the neighborhood as a walk in the park. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical "Fat Kid" is so obviously a slim pre-teen with a mountain of padding under his baggy sweatshirts. I suppose either a) they hadn't invented / couldn't afford a fatty diet, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a pudgy star or c) we are honestly supposed to believe that this child is starving and has an enormously widespread stomach. <br /> <br /> So if you are 2 o'clock and need something ridiculous and disgusting to rip your drunk friends, go look. Personally, I'd rather sleep.
