Anyone who criticizes the Soprano for his stereotypical portraits of Italians has not seen anything before they have seen a good look at this cornball gangster movie that focuses on a family so annoying that you almost want them rubbed out. <Br /> The parents of this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - a totally abrupt, a cloyingly cutesy poo - are inappropriate while their older son, good at nothing, and Pollyanna's daughter are fiercely competing for the audience contempt. But their grandfather is everything, grandfather, grandfather. As played by Chic Sale (in full "Day-nabbit!" State), he serves as the movie's moral compass and throws in lots of diatribes about "dang, dirty dirty foreigners" for good measure. If it's the good guys, it's no wonder that the actors in the era that played evil became the big stars. Not that there are any stellar performances that exist among the criminal actors, but at least they release themselves better than the grid of Leeds family. The incompetent police officers are not even given enough screen time to bring things down. Only Walter Huston, as district attorney, raises the clich√© riddled material in his unsuccessful attempts to breathe in these dolphins. <br /> <br /> The film deserves the honor of being an early entry into what would prove to be a very popular silent dissemination, and it does not slip into its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld, but it is simply better - and less xenophobic - examples in the genre.
