William Petersen (the C.S.I guy) has a small unredited role, but it's the best part of the movie. His character comes across smart ass and hard and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. He has a range that allows him to play almost anything. After his 5 minutes it goes from looking tough to just not much. It gives you hope that his character will reappear in the movie, but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty bad. Worth looking at TMN or a collection at the library, but not much more. Too much of it reminds you of L.A Confidential, except that where the movie begins to become complicated on itself, it is so loose, it controls everywhere but where it is going. 2 out of 5 stars
