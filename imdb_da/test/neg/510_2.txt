It is disturbing to see so many people giving high ratings to this movie. Some of the praise uses such a twisted rationale (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of something that is in any way critical to the United States) that it is approaching hysteria. Heaven's gate is a bad movie, it is fundamentally horrible. Infinite scenes using elaborate images that serve no purpose, muddy dialogue, unclear nudity, no sense of anything except excess ... The high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shift in perception. <br /> <br /> For some perspective, see the Lawrence of Arabia before you see Heaven's Gate. You will see just how effortless and lost this movie is really. The "problems" that it may have tried to deal with are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with films that criticize the US itself, but when a horrible movie gets such undeserved praise solely because of this element ... it's worth challenging. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity, and as a warning to young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw this home for free, imagine the torture being in a theater and sitting through it ... in 4 meandering hours!
