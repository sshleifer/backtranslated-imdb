I really liked the movie 'The Emporer's New Groove', but it was like coming home and seeing your wife having "relationships" with a llama. Seriously this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread for Super Troopers. I have to write 10 lines, but I don't even know what to say. I laughed a few times, but only because I drink. A movie like it should at least be fun when you're full. It was not. Perhaps llamas are just fun and regular comics are not. Either way, just stick with The Emporer's New Groove if you want a fun, comic, lama theme movie. Line 10 is this line right here.
