Dr. Krellman will save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decides a heart transplant with a monkey will cure his son (no - I'm not talking). He does the transplant and (somehow) his son switches from a weak guy to a muscular man with a dime big mask that (kind of) resembles a monkey! Of course he comes out, kills men, tears women's clothes and spends chaos. This is all cut with the boring romance of the police lt. Arturo Martinez and lady wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also get meaningless women's wrestling sequences that don't add anything to the plot. It all ends by copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (of course) a pretty stupid movie. The reason gives little meaning, which is the exact female nudity (a staple for any exercise film) and very graphic gore that looks ridiculously false (except open heart transplant). Still, this has profit. The whole cast takes everything dead seriously and is actually not as bad as actors. Also the dubbed in dialogue was (for a movie like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. Also I saw an excellent DVD print with bright strong color (which helps). We're not talking a classic here, but an OK movie.
