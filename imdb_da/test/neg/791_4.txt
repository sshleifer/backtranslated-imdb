Couples who have financial problems get a box delivered to their door. If they press the button, they get a million dollars, but a person they don't know will die. Do they push the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie based on a Richard Matheson card story that has a few chills, but mostly is a messy affair. The problem is that there is so much going on, it feels like the writer Richard Kelly didn't know what kind of movie he was making. Is this a straight-out horror movie with supernatural overtones? At times, it looks like it is a matter of moral choices, condemnation and afterlife. Is it a science fiction movie? Possibly there are many questions about the Mars project. And what is the strange appearance that people seem to have in a great conspiracy? Is this invasion of Body Snatchers or a demonic takeover movie? Don't know, maybe. And that's the problem, there are many questions, most of them exciting, but there are too many. A little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the movie things seem to stop more than to conclude (even in an open end). I am all about making a movie rich with themes and points, but the author Kelly fills her script with just too many who director Kelly can't do or does away with that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes with The screen time and in those minutes holds the court before it throws the next bit. It made me crazy. (I don't get into the two leaders, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to do about the material so changing) <br /> <br /> It's a dull mixture that does not work (which is ultimately too many holes). I came to the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I was doing. I really didn't like it, but it's more in one, it's not good because it just lacks the kind of way rather. I would take a passport or wait for cable, where it doesn't cost you anything
