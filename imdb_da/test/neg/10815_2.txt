I can't help but forget about the incredible scene in the Alien, as the extra-terrestrial burst of one of the man's breasts. Or even in the Predator, when the invisible monster snuck on the confused soldiers and cut them to pieces. Both of these films played fascinating ideas about the feature that characterized itself. Back to the era of cheesy B-movies and watch big men in fake costumes, parading around killing people in small towns. Recognize now that the two films above revolutionized this genre. The cave does nothing to improve it. It doesn't try anything new, and worst of all, Cave doesn't even have a good deal. Shame on them, shame on all of them. <br /> <br /> Parading around in sexy spandex are the one-dimensional characters in The Cave. Everyone who doesn't seem to break when they witness the death of their colleagues. They just walk together, unfamiliar with the evil creature who lurks in the dark. The reason is very easy to understand. So you have the two brothers, the black guy and the sexy female scientist. The rest (the rest I mean all those who meet piglice) is even more unexciting so the others. We have the Korean assistant, the risky outdoor chick, a Russian researcher and two divers who both lack the feeling of emotion and are stupid enough to walk by themselves. This movie turns out to be extremely clich√© as everyone with the black guy, one of the brothers and the female scientist, meets. It also seems that only Americans can survive the terror since the Russian and Korean doors. Don't be offended if I give away details. There is no real surprise anyway. <br /> <br /> To be straight, they find this hole. They go in the cave. They are stuck in the cave. They start dying in the cave. One of them gets infected in the cave. More door in the cave. They come out of the cave; only to find that one of them has a parasite that will make them a terrible monster that really doesn't seem to bother them. It's the simplicity of the licking plot. It doesn't even try to be original. It even has the part where they decide that their leader is not capable and divided. We have just seen this road many times before. <br /> <br /> I know in a movie like this, it doesn't care about the show, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is just so boring. Cole Hauser was especially unsophisticated and didn't get me started on Eddie Cibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut is hands down the best in the movie. His performance is actually decent. He portrays the guy who calms everyone. All other players are average at best. In a show like this, it's really not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For this reason, we go to this genre of film; the action of course. Now for my regret, the action was boring. The death scene is all boring, hell the whole movie was. There is hardly any blood at all. It is either they disappear and are found later, or they are attacked and die without a blue mark. Seeing the death of the Koreans was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing. The bad things over the shadow most of the things are good. A good example is saying the special effects were well-finished as they were. The only thing wrong is that since everything is going on in a cave, it gets dark. I found it extremely difficult to distinguish between cave walls and monsters. So it was quite difficult to see the creatures themselves. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about monsters. They all looked like each other, and they weren't scary at all. Cave marks the direct debut for Bruce Hunt. I can't see what he was trying to achieve by making this movie. Of course, he made a big mistake. Almost everything about this movie stunk like a stink bomb. A stink bomb is probably even more comfortable than seeing this mess again. Only the most forgiving film grid will find this forgivable. I gave all hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "What the hell was that" for the third time.
