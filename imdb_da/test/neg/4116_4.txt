Yes, of course, the movie's pictures already look awful and not very promising, but the premise and the cast looked good, so I'm still expected to be entertained by this movie. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The prerequisite is good, but the story is full of unlikely and is logically flawless. <br /> <br /> This movie is potentially flushed down the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventure movie out of, you would think. However, this movie fails to entertain and I think this movie is the biggest mistake. Maybe it takes too seriously and a little more humor would certainly not have hurt the film. Instead, it is now no more than a boring and inexpensive watching movie, filled with the unlikely event after the other, who also steals a little too much from other more successful films. Mainly "Jurassic Park" of course. People also do not help make the movie more convincing or at least interesting to watch. I still think Edward Burns did a pretty decent job as the "heroic" lead. However, the rest of the characters are really confused in the movie, and they get very little interesting to do. The film is dependent on its visual, which is extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very annoying character. Basically all her character does is complain and talk about how true she was and the rest oh so wrong. Her character is just not a sympathetic one. And the rest of the characters ... Now I have already forgotten their names, I think it says enough about them. It is certainly true, even if only Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth seeing. He is really excellent in his kind of heavy business role, but from the moment he disappears out of the movie, the movie really goes down fast. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is extremely poor. It has some horrible-looking CGI effects, and they couldn't even get the simpler "blue-screen" effects look convincing in the movie. The sets are also horrible and inexpensive appearance as if they can fall down and break down every moment. The film is never exciting, exciting or adventurous, as the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way. It's a very distant movie with distant characters that don't impress. There are lots of action sequences, but everyone is so ridiculous and far from credible that they never get excited or good enough. So basically, this movie lacks everything needed to make a genre movie like this a good and successful one. It is sad to see how low director Peter Hyams has sunk for the last couple of years after making some good films in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
