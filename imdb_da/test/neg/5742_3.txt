Slayer starts in the South American rainforest where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a bunch of vampires they manage to escape with their lives. Jump forward six months later, and Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter) informing him that there have been other reported observations of vampires and that his former wife and her daughter-in-law Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) has gone there on an expedition to study beetles, she worried, he asks Hawk to take a soldier back to South America and officially back up Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while he also looks unofficially at Laurie and is not killed by the vampires who have decided to venture out of the caves and into the civilized world ... Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook, this is yet another badly made Sci-Fi Channel original which just is not It is very good in every respect. The humorous script has nothing to go to it as far as I could see. It is one of the modern vampire films that decides to choose and choose the 'traditional' Vampire film lore rules that it will use as these Vampires can be killed with stakes through heart and have fangs but at the same time it can freely walk in sunlight and they do not sleep in coffins. The movie is moving at a reasonable pace, but it is all very boring, bland and lifeless. The story is bad and just pretty stupid, the sign is terrible, the dialogue is forgotten & there is very little to recommend here. Slayer also tries to have some sort of ecological message as the head Vampire claims they only start killing people because of their systematic destruction of the rainforest, where they have lived secretly for centuries, unfortunately there is no conviction there and are more like a throwaway line to fill the time than a serious statement. There is not enough utilization content and is a rather unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The actors don't even do anything about the jungle setting, hell I didn't expect Predator (1987), but I hoped a little more about this. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook has made several horror movies all that I have seen have been just as poor, I'm sorry, but he doesn't do anything here and becomes a profound, forgettable look and emotion. There is no atmosphere or tension and, as for real scare, forget it. Gore is maintained, there are some biting throats and a little spraying of blood, but it's not something we haven't seen before or have a great deal of influence. There is also a great vampire monster creature at the end, but it doesn't look so impressive and it gets killed too easily. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 2,000,000, this actually had a decent amount of money spent on it, but it's still a rubbish movie that's reasonably well made, but nothing special or memorable. The sugar action, I'm sorry, but that's the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another bad, stupid and boring Sci-Fi Channel waste that I simply cannot recommend. Not to be confused with the pretty nice once British 'Video Nasty' gorefilm The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than this, so track it down and see it instead.
