I went to the cinema a bit apprehensive, I came out with the rage of the garbage (passing for a movie) I had seen. The actors, especially Travolta, were to be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this. It was clear that the only thing in their mind was the paycheck, not forgetting the obsolescence of their talents and us. Travolta has to go back to making some more "Look Who's Talking" movies as he has dropped back to the level of his pre-Tarantino work. It comes down to something when the LW Talking sequels are better than this one. Travolta is no longer King of Cool, but King of Corn. Michael Caine himself admitted to making bad films for paycheck, Trvolta must follow if he has any self-respect!
