How bad can you make a movie. A good question that House of the Dead 2 manages to answer. I couldn't believe it was possible to get anything worse than the first house of the dead, but amazingly the director has succeeded. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What about excessive, bad FX and a stupid story. Its this kind of movie that gives a bad name to Z-Movies in general. Why couldn't they learn the lesson from the first House of the Dead movie? In any case, I think you would have understood that you should not watch this movie. It's just a waste of time. See "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see some good zombies.
