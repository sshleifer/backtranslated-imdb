Make budget junk about bloodthirsty cultists in Greece led by Peter Cushing. It's up to the priest Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this crap in 1978, and it was "dog of the week" on one of the episodes of Sneak Previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forget which of the two "dogged" it, but I see the point. Crappy movies have the worst Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance performances I've ever seen. There is a monster on the video box. No such animal exists in the film. Instead, you get a statue, but at least its atonomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> The cults resemble Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group could exist. Skip it over.
