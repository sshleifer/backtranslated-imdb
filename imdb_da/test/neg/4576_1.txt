I went to see the "Passion of Mind" because I usually get a kick out of the genre of alternative reality romances, ie. "Sliding Doors", "Me, Myself, I" etc. But this was the worst I have ever seen! I had to force myself to sit through it. I didn't even stay through the credits that are unheard of for me. The magic realism was completely lacking because Demi Moore was grim and they loved she was two timing guys who usually play villains, although each was kind of sexy and appealing. <br /> <br /> There was actually a psychological explanation for the dual life, with an unpleasant frisson of The Elektra Complex; Perhaps the magic should not be explained to this genre of work. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/28/2000)
