I can't believe I was through this waste. Palmer in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit of course artificial that I thought it was SUPPOSED to be a dummy ... until it left a platelet ... stalked dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill's last movie before her death was this stink. Don't waste your time - I wish I didn't. The only saving grace is that it was on cable so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.
