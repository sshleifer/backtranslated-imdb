I like to think of myself as a bad movie thumb. I like to think that the movies most people notice as the worst of the time I can easily handle. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only remember three movies I have had the accident to see that I have repeatedly used the fast forward button for big lumps of history. These movies are The Mighty Gorga, the Seagull's Night, and this little boy, Deep Blood. In the world of Jaw's ripoffs, this falls off the scale. Deep Blood does not have the realistic story of the original crocodile or the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent or the Tintorera comment. No, instead, we are treated with a handful of teens from any randomly failed 80s public access sitcom matches and the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are realized by rapid cuts in documentaries with actors throwing around in the water, occasionally with some of what seems to be orange-ish paint thrown into the water. Normally, I or someone like me will read a bleak review like this and say "cool, I'll find a copy of this!" It was the same thought I had when I read another viewer's review on this site. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another ... let it collect dust on the shelf ... Grab the depths or The Great Alligator instead of satisfying your need for some evil wonder in the water.
