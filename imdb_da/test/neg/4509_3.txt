I know it's impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed almost everything for no reason. In addition, many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie "Paul Renauld" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot gets only a letter) and tells him he is afraid of being killed. This is totally silly because if Renauld's plan had been successful, Poirot would have known that the dead would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the morning house when Mrs Renauld identified the victim). 2) The movie has "combined" two people in one! "Cinderella" has been removed by the film. The girl Hastings falls in love with, and Jack Renauld's ex-girlfriend is a person in the movie! Why for God's sake? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is such a bad golfer. Absolutely eerie and stupid. 4) The film tells secrets much too early (for example, in the beginning). So you know things you shouldn't know. 5) The killer is shot at the end of a person who is not in the book. Maybe because the person ("cinderella") who stops the killer is not in the movie. 6) The book is very complex. The movie only takes 90 minutes. Sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but it is impossible if you include stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (eg bike ride).
