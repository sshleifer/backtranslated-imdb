This movie may have some historical significance, and it certainly seems amazing how well the facts are together, the setting, the rocket, the space funnels, the moon's surface, everybody screams "a classic" - but ultimately the result is making a pretty dull movie to the eyes of the day And the 50ies tech scenes you may be hoping for in a movie like this are far enough not enough to reward sitting through all the sticky dialogue and predictable plot developments. The characters and plot can reward a scientific sociological analysis, but have too little entertainment value many times. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie seems like a good movie to nine-year-olds. The mature themes, the human drama and the violence are also kept at a level for children. <br /> <br /> The images of the earth and moon seen from space can actually be more precise than those of "2001" but then what if their use is dramatically ineffective. In particular, 2001 may seem like an elaborate meditation on themes in this movie, and has Star Wars not in any way modeled the spatial opening titles on the opening titles of this movie? But then again - the legacy is marginal. <br /> <br /> However, if it's a truly groundbreaking and mega-influential mature 1950s Sci-Fi classic, look for "Forbidden Planet".
