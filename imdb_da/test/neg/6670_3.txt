As I write this, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours, cuddling and crying old catch phrases at his increasingly suicide. <br /> <br /> In fact, as you read this, you will probably have joined the following, and the jury documents will include an almost 80-year career of hysterical mirth-making from the gracious funster with the crooked, checkered cap. What most of these obituaries will not remember is how Norman Wisdom had committed some form of suicide at the end of the 1960s with this staggeringly poor, yet oddly convincing, end-paper for his film career. The signs are spooky from off ?? "Tony Tenser Presents" go titles. You scratch your head? "Where have I seen that name before ..?" Well, on the titles of a lot of the cheapest, most crappiest British movies from the 1970s, just take it. <br /> <br /> So it says ?? "A Menahem Golan Production". Oh dear. <br /> <br /> From what I could get out of the following is a combination of Confessions from a holiday camp and last tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourist Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile by being Norman Wisdom (or a variation of it) here. Even in the trash like this one, he is never out of shape and somehow you keep an eye on shared fingers as he paws and dribbles over a (crazy) Sally Geeson. Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were among those responsible for some true cinematic horrors, but the bedroom scene in cinematic cruelty reborn. Sally plays the role of a lobotomized sex toy very well, by the way. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the crazy young cats that populate this movie's party scene might have thought themselves in a quiet moment, "Umm?" old Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess !! "I think it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the beautiful things. This will do for us what Blow Up did for Yardbirds "<br /> <br /> And so old Norman's leading career ended. Freezing his little balls out in Southport. <br /> <br /> I went there once It was a depressing place.
