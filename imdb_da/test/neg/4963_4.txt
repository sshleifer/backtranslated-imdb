Think of this movie as fan service, a wet dream to slasher genre admire. We start with a gory prologue that is largely unrelated to the rest of the movie. Stay ahead for nine months and the real meat on the plot begins: The virgin Mandy Lane is coveted by all the jock and geek in her school and is invited to spend a weekend at a ranch of three guys who think they can be lucky and two bimbos occupied with their weight and boob size. So .. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nothing on a dark night who will only do something but have sex, make drugs and drink spirits. The only other company is a hunky ranch hand that may or may not suffer from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... potential future suspicion maybe? <br /> <br /> So, as you probably have been determined by now, all the housekeepers are slaughtered in a number of bloody ways, and for a change, the black man is NOT the first to die. There are some conventions that still stop as if the gently dressed baby is being chased by a car in a field. Or the lights go out mysteriously in the evening, as our 'heroes' are inappropriately separated to solve the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the end, the movie is like an old 80 horror that has been updated to noughties, and this score succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems with the movies in that era, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the entire company. People are cut up, shot, bludgeoned, etc. But because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in recovering in these situations, it is difficult to care for when the bodies sit up. Someone is murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG, they are brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we get a play with plausible, intelligent and sympathetic characters that make rational decisions, but end up being exaggerated by a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teens with I.Q of the pond-life being picked up by a blown hoodie. Oh yes .. 4/10
