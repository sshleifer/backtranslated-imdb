Bronson took the money and ran with this movie; he must have house payments like me! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of a couple of these Italians stinking from the oceans. I have heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films abroad for tax purposes. I believe in this because otherwise they would make this movie, it was probably not making money. We had a lot of these Canadian made stinkers because the government gave tax breaks to create a film industry. I wonder if it is paid in the other countries like in Canada. Anyway, back to topic this movie is poorly made in every aspect, I think they grabbed Charles Bronson for selling this stink; The dead body at the end looks very fake. 3.10
