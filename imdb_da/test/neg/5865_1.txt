We sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie, what does this have to do with the plot? We hoped that at the end everything would be a little clearer. It shouldn't be. <br /> <br /> I think the director in a fit of pique threw the manuscript up in the air, and then some minor (and avenged) undercarriage made it random again regardless of the scene being filmed (possibly with scissors and lintel). <br /> <br /> The film's motives include: Communism Bad? Nihilism Bad? Poor parenting bad? Threesomes bad? TV bad? Continuous scripting bad? Deconstructionism good? It's really not clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, no German water taxi would ever have a barefoot staircase that would allow passengers to fall into the water. The abundant amount of "achtung" signs everywhere is testament to this fact.
