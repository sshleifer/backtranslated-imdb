I had the misfortune to see this night on the BBC, I expect I might have been the only viewer. From the beginning, there was something completely wrong in the movie, after a few minutes of viewing I managed to find out what it was. THE MOVIE WAS BATH! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal movie that is just old, scary. <br /> <br /> Why was it made for a movie? I've seen a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was okay, but I only saw repetitions of it because they did. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what the story was and at the end I was no wiser. I seem to remember at one point a character, perhaps Farina mentions that Mod Squad can get into places where regular police can't. "The place" turns out to be a "club", one of the hardest places to enter, maybe it was a student man? I lost the plot at this time, or maybe there was no plot, and the movie was only chopped from various remnants from other TV series remakes. Was it an action comedy? I can't remember any laughs. Overall, this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of one like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him, Ribisi would have had someone jump off.
