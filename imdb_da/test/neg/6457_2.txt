Talk about false advertising! What was this in the comedy section of my video rental space? I think maybe there was a ridiculous part in the movie. I can appreciate black comedy, but it only had the variety without any comedy. The movie was generally disturbing and un-funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy, and the rest of the cast was also good, but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind so badly. The end was also disappointing. What would Buddy's motivation be to let Guy get away with what he did? This is not really explained at all. Why would Buddy go to such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy to screw Guy completely by turning him to the police? The end didn't seem to give me a lot of meaning, no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> In general, I didn't like the movie despite the good acting. Spacey speaks mostly scenery for most of the movie, but at the end he gives Buddy a little needed humanity. The story was just not as good as the cast.
