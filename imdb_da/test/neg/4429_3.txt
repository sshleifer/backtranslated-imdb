I saw part of the first part of this movie and small pieces of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think this movie is really worth seeing. The odd signs and events catch your attention and are quite interesting, but there are also bad things in it and some brutal things. The magical and mythical side of it struck me, and for most Christians this movie wouldn't be very appropriate or worth seeing.
