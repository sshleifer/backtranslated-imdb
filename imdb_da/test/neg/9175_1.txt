What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson) let's see ... a parcel owner says to him, "It gets dark outside" which he answers "it gives better ........." night vision. "What does that mean in hell? Actually what the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a policeman, Robert Forster dreams through this bizarre attempt to redeem it serial killer and a killer who videos his murder - in fact, all I remember. <br /> <br /> The movie took place in Texas, had a couple of car gates, and a clich√© diode ended, maybe if you watch this movie with their eyes closed - can it be good? After all, without seeing it .... it would do better ..... night vision. Did that make sense? Nix.
