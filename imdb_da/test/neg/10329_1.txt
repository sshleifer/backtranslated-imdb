This movie is # 1 in the list of worst movies I've ever seen with "Lessons for a Assassin" at # 2 spot. The action is miserable (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible!), The music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie, and the story was absolutely ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable. But, unlike the average action movie, there was no real action in it. Boring. <br /> <br /> The only reason I continued to see it was hoping at some point would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this one.
