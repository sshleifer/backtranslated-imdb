Anyone who judges this movie over a 3 has a very distorted view of film, anyone who has judged this piece sh 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for their taste in film and doubt that they have ever seen a good one. I am always up to give a movie a shot and I did with this one, I was trying to pay attention, I did not try to let my money go 2 waste, but 15 minutes in my friends laughed at me because I listened 2 My iPod 25 minutes later I couldn't even see the assault that occurred in the movie, I looked up and left, I have never ever gone out of a movie until that waste. Anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar or they should be banned from this site. I get so angry when I see a person judging this a 8 when the deities' overall rating is a 9.1, as saying that the movie was close as it is.
