For what it's worth, this is a pretty decent Road Runner comic if it's a little short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are at best appropriate, the animation is competent, and the new restored DVD master looks good. But this is where the qualities end. Allow me to look back a bit: In 1958, thanks to a work conflict, WB got hold of a bunch of canned music that would be used in 6 of this year's cartoon. <br /> <br /> There is only one phrase to describe this card's music, and it's "it has 4Kids sound". I use this phrase to describe music that has no correspondence with the on screen action and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra of members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short feels hopelessly tackled and incredibly uncomfortable, especially considering that there are scenes in this short (namely piano trap) that would have worked best with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I didn't think a WB cartoon would be ruined by horrible music (even Lava's scores aren't that unpleasant), but considering the comic, it's not that remarkable, it almost becomes painful to watch with the music. It is as if late 80's episodes of Doctor Who could be bad anyway and yet made unacceptable thanks to Keff McCulloch's incredibly horrible music (which sounded like he hit the demo button on all 5 of his Casio keyboards at the same time) . <br /> <br /> I need people to call me crazy for this, but I could easily see one of Larriva's RR comics over this. At least, the preserved music was usually synchronized with the action on them.
