I respect Mike Hodges and liked to make Carter tremendous for it's grim prospects, but Croupier just seems like a particularly boring ITV drama. The reserved cold sign is not only preserved by the protagonist, it spread to the whole cast, which means there is nothing to contrast with Owen's character. None of the characters evoke any kind of emotion whatsoever, except for boredom. The end of the movie is also fine. <br /> <br /> The camera's work, etc. Is pretty good, but if you want to see Hodges, look best, get Carter, don't bother with this uninteresting, imaginative trawl through emotions he covered better 20+ years ago
