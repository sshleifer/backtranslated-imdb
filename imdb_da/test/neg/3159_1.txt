Okay, you hippies wonder enough about what I have against an "education" and "informative" show like "Barney"? Now I have a lot of hatred for this for the following reasons: 1. It learns to have a personality and individualism is immoral. No one on the show has a personality. All clothes alike, both speak, work the same and dance the same. Even in the episode called "Being a Individual," the children try to tell Barney what they like and everyone on the planet has to do what I like. Do you want to teach your child to be an individual is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. "A stranger is a friend you haven't met" episode. While seemingly harmless, the performers soon showed that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, several young Barney lovers from all over the United States were hit by pedophiles who used the friendly message of the show to lure children away from their parents. The episode has since been pulled, but the damage had been done. So-called "innocent" errors in the programming, like this one, clearly show why parents should watch television with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you're not happy all the time, you're a bad person. No one seems to show any other feeling, but happiness, no matter what the situation they are. If the child's parents become evil or sad for some reason, the child may think of Mommy or Daddy differently. Not a good message at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! Seems like any problem is solved by magic. At least in performances such as "Fraggle Rock", it teaches us that Magic CAN reimburses it best to solve problems alone. Does Barney teach this? No, of course not. There must be magic in there. And the problem is that many two-year-olds cannot tell imagination from reality, and may think that their parents, siblings or family can use magic to solve everything, but become confused when they cannot use magic and think they are weird. Another boner pulled again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney does not distinguish between stealing and sharing. He has even specifically said that "stealing is okay if the person you steal doesn't mind". Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something that preschool children need governmental figures to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I just have the right thing, I can solve all my problems." When the kids have a problem, Barney gives them what they need to solve it. The message sent here is "Try not to think about solving this! It's too much work and the solution would probably not work anyway. Just use this." Because of this, the children could stop thinking through things (Barney said it was too much work) and became dependent on the "real" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) Of course, this is a good message for Barney marketers, but it's not good for preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message of cheating is okay. In another episode, the children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut on a spoon without losing it. A child puts peanut butter on his spoon and wins easily. The child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child actually bowed the rules and changed the game so he could win. This tells us that cheating is good, you win and people think you're creative when you are in fact often disqualified or worse and seriously dislike other competitors who played the rules. <br /> <br /> 8. Do the kids in this show eat anything other than cakes, cakes and sweets? It teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food, despite Barney's so-called "Health Food" song. Other than that, everyone in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. And finally .... Most other children's TV shows teach creative problem solving well without having to resort to "magic". Barney could also have done so, but instead decided to use the method that was A) best for marketers and B) took least time and money for scripts. It is an obvious sellout that shows how little the Lyons group actually cares about children. It's my rant for all of you.
