Jeff Fahey has such attentive eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that any character he plays seems disgraceful; Therefore, it doesn't really seem to throw him like the good guy of the play, the audience just waiting for his character to break and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh from her renowned role as "Poison Ivy", must have made this movie simply a benefit to Director Phedon Papamichael (he was a film photographer on "Ivy"); plays a character named Daisy Drew (!), she is immediately bumped, leaving us with no one to watch, but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who have not had a single subtle moment on the camera since "Blade Runner"). This white-read script by Michael Angeli relates to a political sketch artist who draws his own wife from a testimony of murder, and although it is not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better suited to an hour-long television series. This cable-made film is short on inspiration (starting with casting) and shorter on surprises. * from ****
