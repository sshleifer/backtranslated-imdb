Thunder Alley finds Fabian banned from NASCAR traces after causing another driver's death. Stanley Adams may want to put him on his racing game, but the other drivers are not about to have him around. Desperate for Employment Fabian runs up with an auto stunt show owner Jan Murray, who pays him peanuts and tries to exploit Fabian's bad rep. He must take it, but Annette Funicello, Murray's daughter, gives another reason to hold on. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Fabian's struggle to return to the NASCAR circuit while juggling both Annette and his current girl friend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has it all over Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is helped by shooting at the southern NASCAR tracks and good movie recording of NASCAR racing. Not helped by a rather stupid story that kills into the real cause of Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from the same. <br /> <br /> Still fans of NASCAR can go after this.
