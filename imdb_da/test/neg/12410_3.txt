Recap: A lone swordman who lives in the desert and acts as an agent for other swords reminds of how his life turned out to be. It began with the fact that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead of getting him to leave his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is in the midst of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to have him killed for having run away from a promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a sword to get Huang protected, and everything is set to an edge when the woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I've seen the Redux version released in 2008 by the original released in 1994. How the two versions are different, I can't say, but Redux is very highly stylized in the way of it Chinese Wuxia action. It is unfortunate as this style seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. An understandable story. But true to its style and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus for author and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore, there are lots of colorful, very beautiful scenes that are completely independent of the story. <br /> <br /> Editing and timeline of the story is also abused. Much is left out in the scenes, the timeline is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and quiet scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated battles, only to be relieved of something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these brutal but very few games, the movie is set in the action genre. The poster and the photographs also involve this, but can almost be considered false marketing. Only a few minutes out of 90 could be considered something like action, the other could not be further away from it. The film as a whole is very slow, boring and thus very boring. Not even the rare action-packed scenes help as they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I might say I'm not a fan of this Chinese style, as they often seem to be hit by the same issues, most importantly, that visuals are more important than history, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
