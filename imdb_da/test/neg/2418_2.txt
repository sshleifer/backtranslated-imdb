Where to start? This movie is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, but if you live outside the United States and follow the game, it's ridiculous. Different rugby traditions such as "Haka" preformed by New Zealand "All Blacks" and only by All Blacks. The Haka leader is usually a member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions in the modern game and has been abused and represented by the author. The movie itself is pretty well aimed, but it is the poor script and over-all-execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account that it is based on a real story, it possesses many clich√©s in history. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this movie then see what rugby really is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this movie has become distorted and distorted so far from what it really is.
