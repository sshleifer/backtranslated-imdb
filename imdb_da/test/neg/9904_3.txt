What is this!! It's so bad. The animation looks so awful, it looks like a ps1 type game. The actors are horrible, they just can't act to save their lives. I sat through this whole movie one at the end I was annoyed when I realized that I had wasted 3 hours in my life. I haven't heard about this movie, did it ever come out to the cinema or went it directly to DVD? A girl was shot?! What's up with that, it was just a stupid movie. They completely copied 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend to people not to waste their time on this. You can spend your time watching 'The Day After Tomorrow', it's much better. Well that's what I think of the movie. In fact why did I waste my time writing about it, ah dam !! It's really annoying me, it's wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now.
