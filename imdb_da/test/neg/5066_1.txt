I admire the effort of trying to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. But the movie is so bad that most people I know couldn't sit through it. The film was relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it has been written terribly and fails to catch the attention of someone who knows nothing about the matter. The music choices do not flow well with the movie, it seems as if someone has just turned a CD player in the background to put the actors "in the mood". The play ... Well, what's the deal? The only people appearing are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. What the relationship development is between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), is like seeing a train wreck. There is absolutely no chemistry, and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments." This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message out (could have been a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. This is a mistake and someone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. In fact, as originally in Estonia, I was offended by this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low budget ghost excuse for a movie. This could have been much more!
