I hated the book. A guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and constantly gets chased by a hitman and a monkey beast thing (both want the dog). Dean Koontz really can't write (I read the book on my sister's recommendation, I should have known better). When I saw this (mostly out of a morbid curiosity), I found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was uncertain in the book, even though it is a book that is impossible to make a good movie of. . At least I figured if they wanted to make a movie adaptation of the worst book I've ever read the filmmakers, just as well can be precise. They transformed the guy and his virgin love into a boy and his mother, for some reason that bothered me most (though I seriously doubt holding it to a guy and his chick would not have done better). Quite simply; bad book, bad movie, you can't see it.
