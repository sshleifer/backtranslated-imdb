A team of amateur journalists and wooden frames captures the wind of a secret government project, Project Carnivore, on a remote southern Pacific island. Scientists producing giant corn, but the genes are spread to other species that create abnormally large Komodo dragons and a cobra (one that is spherical and swims underwater). Can they, with the help of the scientist's daughter, escape the island and tell the world? Although I hadn't seen this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel (which I unfortunately did), it would scream the "Sci-Fi Channel" with its low production value, weak plays and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another creature film, "Raptor Island", but not so bad. I would suspect there should be at least a handful of people working on both movies, but I have not bothered to confirm it and probably not. It will be a sad day when I see one of them again. <br /> <br /> That's not to say it's not fun. I saw it in the morning with my sister's boyfriend, and I can't speak for him, but I thought it was a pretty good time. So bad is it all, it's a fun picture if you like to have fun with movies, and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the movie (I think the actress is called Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also looks like ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here actually does his work with "Furnace" looks respectable (though that movie is intolerably bad). <br /> <br /> I also can't be hard on this movie simply because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad effects? Low budget? No-name actors? I didn't have higher hopes. Still, it doesn't mean it's great either. Getting into couples is nothing to be proud of, and this will slowly fade into the distant memory department. For one fan who likes this movie (and call it "KvC"), stick to your copy because you get a lot of time to get a replacement.
