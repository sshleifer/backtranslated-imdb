Hi, I bought this on DVD from England. You see, I have one of the multiregional players. I thought it would be fun to have a cool movie show to my friends. Well, surprise for Amy-Jo Johnson, she's barely in the movie. Even though she is on the cover. It's really hard to imagine how a movie made this bad in the first place. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about vampires living on the beach
