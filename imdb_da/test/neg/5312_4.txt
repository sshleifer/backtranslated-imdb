I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel to the movie that needed no successor. <br /> <br /> Chili is back, but Rene Russo is gone without a look. Unfortunately, Chili's game was played in the first movie, and instead of finding an interesting personal bow for him, they just have him standing around repeated lines from the first movie. It's pretty weak. Travolta looks old here. It's as if they are moving people around him because his bones are creaking. His pink lip gloss and the blue eyes contacts are very strange. The other bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that requires her to be only the female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hi, these kids have a great new sound.") In any scene, she hits the wrong tone motivationally or emotionally or both. It is painful to see. Despite the many problems, Be Cool gets better after a very unpromising start. I definitely got my laugh off it (Vince Vaughan runs around in fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, Rock, a t-shirt saying "widow" on it), but it doesn't make any good memories after it's over . It is a helium-light love party from the first frame. There is no one as invaluable idiotic as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first was not preaching. <br /> <br /> Working in (repeatedly) gags and lines from the first movie is annoying as it is the stupid concession for Rock's wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrows twice) as it is droll inside jokes : Steven Tyler says, "I'm not the kind of singer who makes appearances in movies". It's the all-star spectacular line-up that's part of the problem. The first movie was not burdened by "stars." <br /> <br /> For a buck rental, let's call it yourself.
