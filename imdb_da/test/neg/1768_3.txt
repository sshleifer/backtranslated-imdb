A poor paced sf / horror venture that takes itself much too seriously, memorable only for (a) the beautiful Mathilda May wandering around naked through the chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. It has a few mildly gruesome effects and exciting moments, and some unintentional fun scenes, but is mostly a waste of time.
