Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before entering the theater. Even its most prominent followers seem to agree that the audience can be completely split up in the middle of their appreciation of this unique movie. Unlike most HK players, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. When they happen, they are rendered in a shaking style, where it is difficult to find out what is happening on the screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and a call of HK's top talent chewing the landscape. As with some of Wong Kar-wai's early work, the dialogue could be more precise. <br /> In short, The Ashes of Time requires a forgiving attitude. Published around the same time as Wong Kar-wai's spectacularly successful Chungking Express, it is clear that the director is not so sure to work with the elements of the martial arts movie. Anyone seeking excitement will probably be disappointed. But those who are fascinated by the director's aesthetics will probably find this a unique experience at least.
