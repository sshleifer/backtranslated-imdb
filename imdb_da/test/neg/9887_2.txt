I read the book after watching the movie and didn't care about it and found it somewhat unclear; But sweet books often make good movies, and one could certainly have. The story of a teenage girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds irresistibly stimulating as it is questionable controllable, and which has an even closer grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolf This story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which films are made: an appeal of some kind to girls and another kind of boys: and I do not understand how the filmmakers could be blind to it and beat the story of one little appeal to anyone. <br /> <br /> To begin with, take the title (which is the best of the book): It is taken from a Hesse quote that is also used as an epigraphy of a person who is in fear and tastes both blood and chocolate in the mouth, a taste as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: the reef between her human and wolf sites, each enjoying just as much fear for both. The film dispenses with the epigraph, and instead introduces the sign that works in its aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the book's title could have suggested to the film producers the erotic charged chocolates of "Like Water for Chocolate" and led them to connect the same symbol to werewolves. But they didn't; So why is it in the movie? In the book are the characters in high school - or in and out, as with the five, a teen who favors black jeans and t-shirts, and falls somewhere between being heroine nemeses and her pet peeves. In the movie they have become decadent twenty-something clubgoers. In the book is the heroine 16, just for an age to discover how her sexuality works on the boy she wants, as well as for herself; she is the one who initiates the contact, then resigns, re-initiates and so on. In the film she is no longer a girl, but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the edge of campus life, but a refugee from the law (and a comic artist to start), he is the one who comes to her, on one way as unattractive as the one her wormy cousin. She puts him in the first place, but then gives in as he is sure she wants: hi, you know you want it. I would have thought that a female instructor would have taken the chance that the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncomplicated, proactive role; but no. In the book, heroine's clan is run from their home because of Fems crimes; in the movie it is because she went for a race (!). She is a great runner, inclined to kick off building walls, and she and her clan houses in trice; much like heroes in martial arts movies and very unlike wolves or something similar to them. In the book they do not become real wolves, but things larger than wolves; in the movie they are just ordinary wolves. In the book metamorphose they in "howling" style with crushing spine; This is one of the things that make the hero aware of the pain that her body brings to her as well as the pleasure. In the film, the werewolves have become magical acrobats, take large swans dive and transform in the middle of the air, shining yellow like Tinker-Bell; It looks cool, means nothing. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan is a little white-worn family that has moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest, but everyone speaks in different accents, no Romanian. In the book, almost the entire package will lead normal life and agree that to ensure - and indeed their survival - a necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And then the characters say in the movie; but the clan is a kind of underground manager - but apparently not a crime commander when he despises criminals - and has a standing agreement with the police that delivers him "meat" to the package. This seems a great exception to the rule of keeping people from knowing; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book, the heroine learns she can't be something she's not when she tries to live a divided life, stuck between human and animal states, unable to be the only thing or the other. Her boyfriend is not confident or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the package can't risk having him around and the two are forced to separate. In the film she saves him as Lassie, and they go out to Paris (why Paris?), At one end that is smiley-faced, but not really happy, as the conflicts between their nature - between nature - remain unsolved. <br /> <br /> But the difference in the movie that inhibits enjoyment most is that while the book characters usually behave within the framework of young adult novels, for some reason they are made as annoying as possible. Every other line is a threat or another kind of oneupsmanship: you will be sad; you do not hear here you will not get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to be free of people acting that way. <br /> <br /> There have been many good vampire films, never a good werewolf movie. Had this one stuck in the book, it could have been the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
