I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. This highlighted all three of these .... but I didn't like this movie. It just went too long, although the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially in the shooting with some good low angle shots. But I thought it took six hours to get to that point and I really can't say why I feel this way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. In fact, it was refreshing to see that de Havilland actually supported Flynn instead of his normal role as an antagonist to him. Something is missing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has been critically criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear the same criticism for many other films that have done the same. In fact, it is rare when a movie is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist story insulted most critics. If the movie had made General Custer much worse than he really was, they would have liked it. Well, too bad. In their twisted way, critics prefer crooks to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I could have enjoyed this more, but I will take many other Flynn adventures over this one.
