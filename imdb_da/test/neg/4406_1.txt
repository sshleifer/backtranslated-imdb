This was one of the most dishonest, meaningless and non-peaceful of the movies I have ever seen. The representation of the other, of the Israelis, was racist, backward and unfair. First, the song that played on the E.S 'car radio when it was pulled along with a very right-wing Israeli driver was "I put a spelling on you" by Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and snake) are influenced by Arab culture, and there is no reason why an Israeli Jew would be offended or angry with a nearby car playing that song. The way E.S. Shown so calmly and collected with sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is believed to force the viewer to see the Jew as crocheted and racist and E.S. as noble and temperate. I have traveled all over Israel and I have never seen an IDF recruitment post since service is mandatory. But in the movie there is not only a recruitment poster, but it shows a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "will shoot?" This is a highly inaccurate depiction of the majority of Israelis and Israeli soldiers, and such an "advertisement" would not even exist on a random Israeli highway. By including it, the director seeks to persuade the public that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists who are hell of murder. <br /> <br /> The Ninja scene was free and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers shooting Palestinians would be just as unfortunate in an Israeli-directed movie as the nineteenth-century film should have been. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comical and violent scenario succeed in inducing applause from the audience as the director has smeared the Israeli side so much in advance that any shot of Israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. The director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges, depicting "others" as a human being or working for peace; violence is created to be the only solution. This is promoted by scenes of exploding thought, falling watch towers and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends is serving in the Israeli military, and the targets of shooting ranges are never Arab women dressed in black or any other quasi-civilian canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints are not instructed to fire in the head of a nearby Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; The method is, according to my friend, giving a war of war, fire in the air or around the area, and so if everything else fails, you shoot in the leg and then interrogate and place. Importantly targeted at a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the right procedure. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the governance was also poor. Repetition was repeated and no longer captivating. Symbols such as the balloon with Arafat drawn on it are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration into the setting; The balloon is Palestinian penetrating and regaining Jerusalem, and it is created without the reason of e.S. The ambulance is checked for permits from Israeli soldiers followed by subsequent Israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint, an excessive claim for an Israeli double standard by the director. The director's attempt to show life in Nazareth so dull and meaningless is done with overkill; shows the routines of random people over and over, even with a small change every time, and emphasizes that not a member of the casting ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams the purpose of such scenes, the boy of life, without giving much room for personal interpretation . Unlike a "section" of the film, the daily life of Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this sadness over Israel, but never gives direct evidence as to why such guilt may be properly argued . <br /> <br /> I spent hours figuring out why music ended abruptly and began suddenly and why many modern fashion show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. I still can't make an answer. I felt the music was out of this movie; The contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought-provoking. I can understand if the instructor intended to give music to some comics on specific scenes, but I found out that there was nothing comical to be found in Israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting with a ninja, or a woman must suffer another trip through a checkpoint, albeit defiantly. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by missing scores during quiet scenes. Regardless of the instructor's intent, it has only given an audiological discontent throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has no legitimate political message because it gives an incorrect and extreme representation of the other and actually neglects to solve any problems. It is a propaganda film, because the instructor intends to sympathize with various symbols, styles and scenes to the Palestinian side, while the Israeli side appears cruel and inhuman without exception. The lively atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or intense music is reflected in all Palestinian violence against Israelis, so that the almost inevitably positive and enthusiastic feelings, music and cinematography evoke from the audience are directed at one side. There is no thinking, reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict of the audience; Emotions are simply drawn to one side and held in a "good vs bad" clich√© scenario. I think this film lacked depth, quality and power in other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee."
