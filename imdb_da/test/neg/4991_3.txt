When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many of the victims I had to make. I knew I should change diapers and take them for swimming lessons and attend many a freezing Santa Claus pair, but I wasn't ready for that kind of sacrifice I made last night. This is in my humble opinion gross and unusual punishment. Underdog is bad. It's not quite Karate Dog bad, but it makes The Shaggy Dog feel like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a TV show, I'd recommend flipping on. Not even Puddy's presence and banky Edwards voice can save it. Bow. Wow. It was also just about the best 80 minutes I have ever had. James sat to the right of me and Michelle to the left, and I spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mess than watching the screen. At 5 and 3 years, they were the target audience, and this film nailed the target. There is a scene where Underdog belches high in another dog's face and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. As Underdog fled into outer space, James was literally at the edge of his seat, fascinated. The kids absolutely loved the Underdog and that is why I was there. That was what last night was about. <br /> <br /> Unless you accompany a person under the age of 10, you have no game to waste a second of your life looking at this brutal movie. But if you're looking to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old, I won't judge. I had fun.
