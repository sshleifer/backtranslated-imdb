Writer & Director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer in the underground movie movement of the 1960s, satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising company with its avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope." Downey does not limit his ridicule to advertising, but tackles the black militant culture, the dynamics of Hollywood's depiction of race, the elite white power structure and the nature of corruption in any power struggle. It is as hard and ambitious as "Putney Swope" strives to be, it qualifies as a horrible movie that is amateurishly crafted on a shoe string budget with a non-named and humor lacking hilarity. All about this movie series of improvisation. "Putney Swope" raised the controversy during his first release with his politically incorrect handling of race problems and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers movies, the plot is thin and excuses Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are awful. The chairman of a prestigious advertising agency Madison Avenue dies during a board meeting. Before the body is removed, the board has a secret ballot to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for themselves. Whole accident occurs when everyone votes for the token-black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), when no one thought anyone would cast a vote for him. Swope pink all glides, but one of the white leaders surrounds himself with black staff for gun packages, and renames the company "Truth and Soul Advertising." Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco or war toys. Swope's customers are emigrating after becoming CEO, and grandstanding attracts a new line of customers appearing in the office that smells of money bags and is willing to suffer abuse from Swope's militant employees. Swope also exploits his African American employee ruthlessly to exploit their ideas after he burns them and evokes a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are hailed as a "new wave" of marketing genius. Incredibly, Swope's conservation is successful, but the agency becomes the target of government operations claiming that Swope's advertising tactics are "a threat to national security". The highlight of this black and white 85-minute comedy is the television commercials shot in color. Unfortunately, Downey doesn't know when to cut off those ads that consistently start running smoothly, but welcome their welcome. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" involves our eponymous protagonist's talks with US President Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana toking mouth with a Kissinger-like teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf), spraying tasteless jokes while he trying to convince Swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, Borman 6.
