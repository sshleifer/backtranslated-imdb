This is a completely forgettable image. One of my friends picked it up in a dealership at a $ .50 local rental site. He should have demanded repayment. Or at least a discount. The plot is something like this: A giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human on the planet should be chosen to save the earth. Thus, a small holographic space story appears in front of a postal worker and tells him that he is "the one". The devil is in the details when it's time to judge a movie, and on the counter Zarkorr! The invader otherwise fails. Monster Zarkorr has only a few short moments on the screen, totaling maybe 5 minutes tops (with a generous estimate). The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and can be the most interesting character to look at, and only because she has a "teeny bopper" stereotype outfit, complete with a just short pleated skirt. The climax battle with the monster is over before you can say "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over." In the next moment you are back to consider whether you have just experienced a train wreck or if someone has just drained 3 pints of blood from you. Although this movie only gave a line that my friends and I repeat to this day and laugh and still was the only bright spot in this otherwise bad picture. As thrown by "protagonists" is "interrogated" by the fuzzen, one of them answers the questions with the statement "What are you, a kind of questioning?" It is so terribly delivered that if you sit with a group of friends (who will not be your friends long, if you actually spoke your friend to see this), you could actually experience a shelf or two of incredible laughter. <br /> <br /> Though this is not a manos or eegah (it's not even bad enough to be classic bad), this movie will still drill you with its horrible dialogue, imaginative characters and non-existent special effects and deserve still living bottom 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
