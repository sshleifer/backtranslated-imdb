This is a horrible resumption of a very good movie called "Up In The Air" by Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I was only able to get through approx. 20 minutes before I turned it off. Almost all lines are identical, I have no idea why they would resume the movie. I totally disagree with a previous post that does not like the songs (which is the same too). In the original, the song is first and foremost, I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually made her own song, it's hard to tell when the vocals were usually added later and the songs are very good, surprising in a "B" movie. If you get the chance, see the original, it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
