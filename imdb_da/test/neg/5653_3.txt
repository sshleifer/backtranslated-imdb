Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut in the "School of Rock" with Jack Black and his role as Megan in the show "Drake and Josh" and she has become a favorite of the Nickelodeon audience, so it's not a surprise that Dan Schneider would make a show just for her. Unfortunately, it gets just as bad that if not worse than "The Amanda Show". <br /> <br /> "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have been idolized in the junior high community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts, and Freddie shoots and sets it up on the Internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, who is traded by the hilarious Jerry Trainor, known for his work in "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you this. Do not believe in 8.3 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in almost every aspect. Dan Schneider probably spent about 5 minutes studying teenage interests because everything I see, he says "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Aha! Teenagers love something that begins with" I "!" and a majority of concerts used in "Drake and Josh", if not, then they are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on a generosity like "You want me to turn AC on 60 degrees ? "" No. We want you to screw up to 60 pickles! " Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all the sets in the shows were used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified", which were simply spit and polished with random things to try to make it look different . <br /> <br /> The scenes where the show shows a broadcast of the iCarly network are just as terrible as the whole series itself. The dialogue in them is terribly bad, which can be accepted by some, as only two friends play around in front of a camera, but what about the weird, humorous antics they do as "Random Dancing!"? And it just gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jennette are not at their best, far. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is not credible at times, but he does an okay job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous skill of Jerry Trainor, who fits well into his "protective elder brother" role, and his broad eyes with high-key plays can make some beautiful fun segments. Too bad they are not frequent, for it could have given the show an extra star in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove his own cable-fed playground to jump around and vomit involuntary jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in all directions because everyone else has extraordinary talent buried under the poorly executed script and weightless plays. Dan Schneider did a good job with "Drake and Josh", so it is a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a mistake. Jerry Trainor actor hid this show from a 1 out of 10 rating, but he alone cannot save "iCarly" from being as horrible as it is.
