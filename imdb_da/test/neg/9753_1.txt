the actors cannot act all the dialogue was plagued by bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ... EVER. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new at all. Any child from the street gets involved in a professional dancing world, and it's about his life. it combined with the whole incident involving the toddler is taken directly from You Got Served and Save The Last Dance (I'm not saying these movies were good either, but that means that this movie didn't bring anything new to the table) ). <br /> <br /> And the dance ... There were only 3 dance quotes throughout the movie, and 2 of them were taken from the trading market. Maybe I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT in any way a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique or any wow factor, all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. All the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls, but no more. The Grande Final left me thinking "... OK, now they are getting serious" all the way through the end when I realized it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit it is probably hard to make a good dance movie, but Step up is no exception to the rule. You got served, with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture, at least the dance aspect. Save the last dance was garbage and it was just a musical from the last 10 years (although I was impressed with the Moulin Rouge) ... look to the Center Stage for Ballet, watch Beat Street for Hip-Hop
