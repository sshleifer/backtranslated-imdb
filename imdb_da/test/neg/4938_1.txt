OK this will contain spoilers. Now I have never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative / compound at the elephant's cabinet in the zoo! It has more plot holes than moth eaten lace and as for the 'realistic' plot line. Good sexual slavery is a terrible and very real worldwide problem, and this pile of links exploits this plague as a plot unit to titrate and righteous, ashamed of everyone involved for that kind of dubious judgment. But back to the movie, if you had to kidnap people from an airport, some of the safest and camera happy places in the modern world by the way, why plant a chair on the inside of the habit that does everything until the plot needs for a twist. Wait until you are out of the airport, take the gun, handle the passengers, drive quietly to the warehouse and kill the boys, the job. On the passengers' side, the good guys in at least three apartments are incapacitated and are armed, waste them! Once in a movie, it may just be acceptable that you don't put a bullet in the bad guys, but come on three times! And after he killed most of you. Also, the guy is willing to put the gun to stop a scarred cheek, but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be cleared up with $ 20 worth of drugs. I could go on and on about the amount of gaps in this, but I won't waste more of my time. Suffice it to say that I have rarely been so offended by such a terrible beverage, and for the real problem of sexual slavery, the girls voluntarily go to new jobs in remote countries and are abused, raped and often killed by the gang master who meet them from the boat / plane and take their passport and freedom. This is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this! Do not waste your time!
