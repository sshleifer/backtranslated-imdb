As a fan of bad movies, I was thrilled to find a 3 pack cr @ ppy horror at Best Buy today. The set was inexpensive and included a horrible movie called "The Dark" which I actually remember watching in the theater. <br /> <br /> The remaining 2 were just as bad. "Beings from the abyss" is probably the worst of the pile. Since they were all bad, it didn't say much. But its stupidity, bad acting, terrible effects and retarded history have actually made this very fun to see. I rolled on the floor with every new basic development. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong !!! It was good!!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be sex scene. OMG !! I almost lost it !!! Between that and the "monster cam" I have to say that I have had this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of bad movies, so I enjoyed it, but in all fairness I had to give movies a 1. IT WAS TERRIBLE ... But if nonsense is your bag, at least remember this ... (Yes the bad wordplayer was intentional)
