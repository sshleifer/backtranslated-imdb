Time has not been good for this movie from the transition day of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster who falls for a socialite who wants to help down on her happiness violinist she loves. There are, of course, complications. The problem with the movie for me is that it has not been aged well. Performances are everywhere with some emotional scenes seemingly so over the top to be ridiculous. A late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me crying with her singing song delivery. There are other times when the movie becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. It's not a bad movie, it's just that the technical limitations of the movie get in the way of real enjoyment. Usually I'm forgiving, but this time out I just couldn't go with the flow (so again was the copy, I saw, absolutely horrible). Worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)
