Looking at this movie made me wonder why was universal filming here? They had a wonderful series of movies with all the classic horror movies. The opening of the atomic age brought on an attack of gigantic creatures. Spiders, Ants, Prayers ". With The Deadly Mantis we have a huge peasant mantis flying around the Arctic, frightening Eskimos and being hounded by the armed forces. The bay reaches a tunnel in New York, where the soldiers eventually destroy it. All the more about seeing it on the MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the movie by showing a huge card?
