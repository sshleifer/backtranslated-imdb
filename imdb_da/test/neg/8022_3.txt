Three young college women, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic), go on an adventure leading down the Kolpa river and share their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia in this Slovenian film from Maya Weiss in 2002. What could have been an Eastern European version of the well-known and exciting 1972 "Deliverance" proved to me to be completely uninspiring with flat character images that refused sympathetic identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and Zana are not convincing as students at all, though Alja expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what seemed to me to be excessively bad language. Alja bored with her boyfriend and seems to be just drifting together in life. Zana, even less scientific, is a self-proclaimed adventurer with an attraction for other women. I had some sympathy with relatively innocent Simona, conservative and star-eyed. The soul of these three journeys together just doesn't work for me. The contempt that Zana and Alja show towards Simona makes no sense - why should they choose her as a travel society at first, so surely they must know her attitude and attitudes? <br /> <br /> The three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes, undeterred by a novelty of a woman's disappearance along the river. Things become more gloomy with the mysterious look, sometimes right and sometimes possibly hallucinatory, by a rabid conservative fisherman (Jonas Znidarsic). I enjoy the scenes along the river and in the small villages of the trio visit. It may be due to lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not move me otherwise. I was surprised to see that the film has won some awards.
