This is really a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to firefighter, the stupid scenes of "we are just a bunch of mighty guys" in the midst of "my goodness can be really dangerous" parts. For the most part, it's just stupid. You couldn't believe in a single minute that real firefighters seem like this. It's so terrible I couldn't bear to see at times. If my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end, I would have had no option but to extinguish it. <br /> <br /> I am John Travolta's fan. Every interview of his, I have seen, just raises my opinion on him. I think it was a strict value for money. I'm sure he'll be happy when this one is forgotten.
