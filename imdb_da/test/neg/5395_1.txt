I got this in The Horror Six-Pack from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. In fact, this movie sucked so hard, I don't know how to write this review, especially since 1. I knocked it out of the DVD player because I couldn't even see another second and 2. Hurricane Friggin 'Ike comes and God know how long 'it takes for me to get this review finished. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this supposed legend, known as the Skeleton Man, kills him and later his wife. So ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's really not much else I can say about this POS, except don't bother. I currently use the disk as a coaster, and if you see this, you might want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker need cash ... BAD! <br /> <br /> PS. I would basically review the movies in the boxset and maybe make a new review on Ghoulies IV.
