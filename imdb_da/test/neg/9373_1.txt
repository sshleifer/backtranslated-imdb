The trademarks of this film, such as Suit Supply, depart from history because it was to be listed in the eighties. It's not a very exciting movie. In addition, the single from Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus repeated several times, like "I'm a cruel man, I take it all away, I'm a cruel man, I'm here to stay .." Jeeez Couldn't these asswipes come up with anything better than that? I suppose they wrote it in a few minutes. It's really annoying, like the product placement in this movie product that pays the controversy and talk about a criminal who should not be a celebrity he is now made to be, but must be forgotten as rats should be.
