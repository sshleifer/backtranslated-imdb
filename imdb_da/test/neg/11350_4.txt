A Chinese band attack and wipe out another gang at the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. Strangely and without any appreciable reason, the gang requires a volunteer to blame the massacre and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. Now how a man alone is responsible for about 50 deaths is past me, so sending one guy away just seemed silly, but it's plotted. Later, when this man comes home, betrayal and twilight have occurred - leading to almost an hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop killing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Chinese martial arts movie with much of a plot, then you probably have to skip this movie as it practically does not stop and virtually no plot or character development - even in comparison to other martial arts films. I would estimate that 80-90% of the film is combat scenes - endless and reasonably well-favored combat scenes using knives. Again and again and again, fight scenes! If you want a movie with a body count that might run into the hundreds when people are beaten, kicked and slashed, then this is the movie for you. The problem was at the end of the movie, there are literally no people left to kill, and the movie really lost my interest !! Deeply it is not, but if you only want to see excitement and action, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> That way, this movie is set in the present day and no one is thinking of shooting the hero until the very end. And when they FINALLY make it logical, it's too late, and the effort is really, really lame! Logical errors like this and the lady's suicide (why ???) make this a "swallow your brain" type of movie.
