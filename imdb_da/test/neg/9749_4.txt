This is probably the only movie I've seen, where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is a horrible, obscure movie with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a breakdown for a director like John Landis. And it does well. <br /> <br /> To appreciate "The Stupids", keep in mind a little known but very true maximum spoken by Director Abo Kyrou: "I encourage you to learn to watch bad movies, they are so often sublime. "For film to work, the film must create and follow its own logic, and if it makes it so convincing and sincere, then it is actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you see "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional widespread comedy, it is complete and complete garbage; When you see it with the understanding that it is actually a neo-surreal comedy, it is brilliant. It also works with good movies. If "jaws" had not accepted the reality it created, the floating explosion would not have worked. But many believe that "jaws" are very overvalued for this type of reason, and they are not wrong. But it has strengths, doesn't it? The point is that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others will never matter how often it is explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even after that, I still can't see it from his P.O.V. That doesn't mean he has something wrong. If you have the right state of mind when you see this movie (and I don't understand it, I'll put it in bed now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the stupid, cheap, meaningless slapstick late-80s / early 90s style farce that it is. <br /> <br /> The defenders and hates of this movie are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The film accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idioci. And because it takes it and runs it, the movie focuses solely on using it to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic correctly; Bad movies are bad because they make up as they go together, while movies like "The Stupids" know where it goes, what it does and why from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can't defend the movie from an artistic point of view, which is why I give it such a low rating. The play is mostly bad, the jokes very shallow, and live-action quality probably destroys what would have worked as a cartoon. But I cannot deny that it is entertaining in its own way, and therefore I defend it. I got it right away and I am ashamed of those who don't. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo look (hear him say "Slip the Drive!" would have been worth the rental fee even though I hated this movie) but was amazed to find out that apart from the TV study Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes were fun (especially the airbag-cigarette explosion) because of their cartoon-like context. They were stupid, but they were funny. And the film doesn't pretend to be anything else: a BIG comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for what it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.
