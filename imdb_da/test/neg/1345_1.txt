Imagine a movie, the complete opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having an all male cast, yet it has a cast. Instead of being put in the rugged deserts of Arabia, it lies in New York City's bulging city. And instead of being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most meaningless, boring and forgettable. <br /> <br /> The film deals with Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a perfect wife and mother, the envy of everyone else in her high society Manhatten social circle. She is painted as women who carry the world's weight on her shoulders, despite the fact that she needs to live in a nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child. But I don't want to be too hard on her, Mary does all this while taking a liassez-faire attitude to the fashion design that her father has given her. This idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever, though things start to go down in a really real way. Mary's husband is cheated on her, and her father is burning her not to work hard enough. She is naturally sad and breaks a little. Mary has to jump back, but for her impressive young daughter and herself. She does this through the rehab, hair straightening and design of her own line of clothing; But great for this kind of movie, not a montage. M Maria succeeds her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now. She decides to take her sneaking husband back after understanding that it was her fault that he cheated on her not pulling on him enough. <br /> <br /> The movies that save grace are that it doesn't fall into "all men's evil" route.
