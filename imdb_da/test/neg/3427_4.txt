I just caught "Goodbye to the King" on cable, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was on the craptastic side. Scripture and direction are pretentious (when I found out that John Milius was responsible, it all became clear). The support actors were actually not bad - James Fox was excellent. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, whom I usually enjoy. When he goes native, he starts talking a very stiff, stolen English, and half of the time he seems a little distracted, as if he had just smoked some of Borneo's rainforest bounty. And then the end - what ??? Learoyd happens to be on the same boat as The Botanist (by the way, the botanist had dumped the boyfriend, or what?) ??? The boat just happens to drive the plot conveniently close to an island mature takeover of a crazy Anglo ex-headhunting Army deserts ??
