Crash should be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in fact, it's just a lot of coincidence between several characters that connect each other in one day in one of the world's largest cities. Who the hell are you supposed to believe? There are unrealistic situations, one after another. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latin Americans, blacks and whites. But the big mistake is dependent on a prior racism coming from the author. Mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrayed as people with a better social economic status than the rest of the other races. The Iranians are poor, like the Asians. And Latinos is, as always, portrait as housekeepers, police officers or with a very low job as a locksmith. Jesus !!! Don't you think it's time to change these stereotypes? Same with black, portrait as gang members, except for a black TV director who was the only fresh person for me. This movie sucks so hard, it makes me so disappointed with the kind of cinema that comes out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotypical characters. No realism at all. Nothing to identify with. It is simply a huge waste because it could have been a great opportunity to show Latin Americans, Koreans, Iranians and Blacks from a different perspective.
