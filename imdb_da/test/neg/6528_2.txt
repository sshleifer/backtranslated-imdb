.... and now I'm up to episode 7. I really hoped it would be over now (not to mention annulled, when everything with the show - including the actors - had been dumped with some toxic waste in the middle of the sea somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series is really gloomy. <br /> <br /> To get this program listed under the "comedy" genre is at best misleading! It is so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something so bad, it may mean much input from the other authors in everything he has been to before. In some episodes I haven't even laughed! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can't believe that Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing 'My Hero' and started doing it instead, his decision-making skills obviously deteriorated that day - maybe he can simply did not read and did not understand how poor the scriptures of 'Blessed' were. Don't make me wrong, 'My Hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And just to annoy me even more, I know it gets a DVD release like Well, when there are so many big TV shows that won't be released!
