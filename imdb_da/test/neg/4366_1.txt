There is a great song in Killjoy 2 that continues with how clowns are usually really nice and fun, but Killjoy is a killer. I can't remember the song in the first movie, but when songs Olimpia Fernandez are singing 'Killjoy, yes Killjoy 2' sounds like the 2 may have been added to for this grim sequel. The movie is much worse than the first movie and it was really bad. This time, the cast, including the usual excellent Debbie Rochon, has quit trying and director Tammi Sutton creates no excitement and presents just a dull and stable movie. Full Moon images produced this during their 'Urban' phase, none of which were very good, but none as bad as here.
