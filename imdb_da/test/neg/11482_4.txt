I was expecting much more from this movie. The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. The bottom line is that "Sebastian Cole's adventures" only had a decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier and found his performance very comfortable. The character is well designed, but everything else just goes into operation through the film's duration. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think his character was explained too well. I think there is not too much to explain; he will be a woman. Something was still missing. <br /> <br /> The obvious low budget of the movie was nice to see. I enjoyed the movie being filmed in just one script (one bad one then) and only a few actors. It was a nice change. <br /> <br /> While the main idea of ​​the movie was actually okay, it was disappointing to see many scenes that had nothing to do with what was just thrown here and there. As I said, the script was promising, and I have to say I was interested in where director Tod Williams was heading, but basically it was a very slow movie with no good dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started looking good at the end, but again it just fell into a hole. The action was mostly good, the writing needed some work, but the film's budget helped it in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone if they wanted to watch quiet movies with a strong lead character, but except I would stay away. Personally, I wouldn't see it twice.
