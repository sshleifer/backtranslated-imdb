I must preface this comment with a kind of recording: I suppose I just have a soft spot for the original television series from the 60s to the 70s. I think the filmmakers here blew it from the get-go as far as casting: in a supposed remake, the audience would look for reflections of hip, athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III) or the cool with Michael Cole, and and so on. Instead, we get Giovanni Ribisi as a poor-white-white rich boy who comes out as just pathetic as if he is in all his roles (in the office I used to work in, I once amused myself by creating a fake movie poster, casting various actors as members of office workers; guess who I was throwing as dorky son of the company's president?). The Danes do OK as the new Julie, but none of the characters have much to do as the story is just sitting there, spoiled in convention. So it is also completely forgettable. What did I talk about?
