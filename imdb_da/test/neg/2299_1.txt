When my mother went down to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson to always keep my mother the video store! In fact, the only reason she chose it because Colin Firth was in it and she * coughs * thinks he is a good actor! <br /> <br /> It starts with some beautiful veiws of Africa and goes down and down AND down and down. After this movie, I was very surprised that Colin Firth came as far as he did, as this pointless movie could ruin any career of an actor. The story is about a divorced woman whose son tries to bring her to a man called Matthew Fields, whom he met while impressing his friends because of his great house. The Nimi divorce doesn't even like Matthew and goes out with the local president who doesn't like her son John. ... and the same with him! I'm sorry if you disagree with me and I hope I haven't offended you, but to all those people who haven't seen this movie, I leave you with a word of warning, don't watch this movie! !!!!
