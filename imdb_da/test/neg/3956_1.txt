I haven't laughed so much in a theater over the years. The only problem is that the movie was not supposed to make my neck raw. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely crowded with bad CGI, absolutely horrible duologist, absolutely horrible * play * and enough geek references to do all things come as nothing but complete cheese. As a gamer and a geek-type girl herself, I recognized all the obvious game references in this movie as well as geek STUFF, which was just thrown into the background as eye-catcher (Steamboy poster, t-shirts from thinkgeek.com and j-list.com). ), and it was not the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have been good in EVERYTHING was the ghost kids drawing characters that were badly done in CGI to make it look like they were from a game and were stolen by Japanese horror movies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was hilarious, and something I would expect from a midnight viewing of a Sci-Fi channel made for TV b movie. Don't expect more than that and you will have a good time. You just don't get a soda or you spit it everywhere when you get great lines like, "Why did you take that game into our lives? Why?"
