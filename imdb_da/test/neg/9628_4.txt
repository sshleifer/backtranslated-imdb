I didn't really wonder Mirrormask. I just wanted more from a movie than beautiful visuals. The film begins with a young girl named Helana, who works in a circus. But while other children (probably) will run away to the circus, she will only run away from the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wants her to die. Bad movement. The mother gets sick with ... something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. At night before surgery, she dreams, she travels to a wonderful world of her dreams and nightmares where she "finds herself". Personally, the movie was run for me as soon as she started to dream. The early scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the gloom of the hospital and a flatness of a block of flats. But as soon as she dreams, the whole movie goes to CGI, where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has nothing of the mystery and is wondering about it. while movies like the Wizard of Oz seemed enticing to explore Mirrormask shoves pictures in our faces and then snap them away to give us another picture. There is little rhyme or reason for the design in this movie, and although some things are very beautiful (the librarian is a masterpiece), they just disappear so quickly that they will soon be forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. Overall Mirrormask is like a beautiful action that you bite and find out is actually ash. Stick to real-world kids.
