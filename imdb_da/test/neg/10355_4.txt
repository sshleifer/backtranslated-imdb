There is something about this show that keeps me looking and hoping for the future of the future. In the writing, the jokes are few and far between, and the lines of history are a bore, so I find that it must be the physical comedy and visuals. I enjoy the camera's movement, set of dressing, and wardrobe. It is entertainingly strongly opposed to the dullness that prevails. And I'm pretty sure every time I laugh, it was because of John's or Molly's physical comedy. The two of them make a boring sweet couple that makes me laugh and will puke at the same time. <br /> <br /> So here I am ready to sit down to Kath & Kim again tonight to see which way this production will fall (or as it seems to be positive).
