This train wreck begins with Brujo and Alma crossing the Mexican border. Alma suffers from a certain horrid curse that causes her to throw sea trees and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes as well as attaching her teeth and murmuring nonsense. So obviously Alma has this uncle in Los Angeles who knows about a cure for her. They jump aboard a train to get there and fortunately pay a friend of their way. Alma and Brujo stay in the luggage cart the whole movie, as they cannot afford first-class seats. In the higher class we see a bunch of nobodies on their way to LA for whatever reasons. A balding guy on a business trip, two girls, one of whom carries $ 5 grand and a lot of cocaine, three stoners and some Mexicans. The Mexicans have to deal with Brujo and try to take their "weed", which apparently is a calming for Alma's snakes that slide into her. They realize that the snakes do not attack, they enter your body through your veins! Very twisted and B-film. Brujo saves the guy by tearing his heart out (Temple Of Doom style) and acquiring the snake. For some reason he may not have the tubing damaged or it will harm Alma. While this is taking a drug, the expert tries to bust one of the girls and get a little action (topless) in exchange for not telling about his drug delivery. A mystery guy shows up and has a fight with him. As a grand finale, Alma becomes a vampire, bites her husband and then becomes a huge pathetic excuse for a CG snake, the size of the train, eats the train and is blown into a nuclear weapon hurricane whirlwind and disappears. Everyone then leads to LA on foot. The credits actually say at the end. "Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely random and very strange. We suggest moving and / or taking a plane". Beautiful since a line in the movie from the bald guy is "Yes, I HATE FLY!" The credit continues to say "No snakes were damaged during the production of this manuscript. Only a small child, but it's cool." There were actually a lot of real snakes that were used in the movie, and all of them were very tame. There is actually no scene with CG snakes that attack anyone unless you count the big one, but then it just eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and it looks like a muppet. The snakes do not attack anything, they are just ... there. A crawls out of toilet paper actually! <br /> <br /> The movie is not fun, is not scary (as there is no real snake attack) and is just a "quickie cash-in" which is when a low-cost movie company hears about a big budget Hollywood release Then they rush to post a similar movie, or even a periodic version, just before or simultaneously with the big name flick. The effect of this being that many people either confuse each other and look faster than "biggie" or, they want to see both, for whatever reason ... like myself. Avoid at all costs.
