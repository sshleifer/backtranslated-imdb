Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's terrible. The action is not too good either. But there is something about what makes you look more (like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the killer eyes are more fun than anything. If you are looking for a scare ... this is not the girl for you. It is very unclear and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while it is called HOSTAGE. It doesn't matter what you call it, it's still a bad choice for entertainment. It can be good for a MST3000 party or something. Can you believe they would use such a title as another son of SAM? If it doesn't have exploitation written over it, I eat my hat. I remember when this was shot in Belmont, NC. A lot of local personalities were used as talent.
