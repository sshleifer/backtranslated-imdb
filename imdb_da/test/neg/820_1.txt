I like Ali G's show, I think the guy has comical instinct, but has not yet developed it into a talent. The movie is a little worse than I expected. I can't find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Witnesses to 5 year olds, some good, some awful. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that seems "offensive" but it's actually fun, see Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
