I got this movie on DVD titled Evil Never Sleeps, it gives the front page billing to Carrie Ann Moss, but she plays such a small character that I didn't really notice her in the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I'm considering this for the worst purchases I've ever made. The dialogue was stolen and the delivery tree, I found the play to be interrupted from the plot. Graham's performance for me was by someone wondering if she's left the gas at home. <br /> <br /> All in all, both my wife and I found this movie painful to watch, and it's not a valuable addition to my collection, seeing it at your risk, but spending 90 minutes getting your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time.
