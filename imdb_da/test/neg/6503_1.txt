ABC is gearing up to the repertoire of another unrealistic rural Australia representation. Yes people, that's all there Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, an actor of little talent) Fire Hero, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) city grove, preggers of Baca's brother Joe (I think). Then there is Uncle Geoff, Big Daddy of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams at speed. Only saving grace is the Russian actress Natalia Novikova as Baca's loony missus. She is fantastic. I can't understand why John Waters took the film as Lilly's psychologist man. Need the money I expect! Still, he won't be long as Lill and Baca want it from toute suit. Just watch this lemon to see how bad an Aussie show can be. Frankly, I'm ashamed.
