I'm sorry guys, everyone who thought this movie might be something amazing, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed. The standard that the film wanted to set is completely destroyed by a very simple plot. So simple, that the film doesn't evolve to the end. I asked myself if the plot was not about the action, but about the protagonist (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found out that the sign was inconsistent - whether he is a professional killer or a guilty haunted brother. But both do not go together, because the child he is trying to lead puts him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. Now Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a wonderful actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. I didn't believe his action, it seemed the director was trying to pull him out of a personality he couldn't give. And he didn't need because his less crazy behavior was scary enough. The only one whose performance was great was Diane Lane. If not she would give this movie 1 star. In conclusion, I expected to see some well-played movies and some interesting plot. And I totally blew it with my high expectations.
