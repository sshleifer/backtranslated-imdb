Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renne Zelwigger. They are all terrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It is directed by the same guy who did the English patient, and it is based on a best-selling novel about a man who risks coming back to his lover, but unlike the wonderful English pateint sucks this movie. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Worst dialogue ever. "But we only know each other for a moment." "But they were a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag" <br /> <br /> <br /> "In some cultures you just have to say I marry you 3 times and you are married "lovey-dovey-" I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you ... "I'm ashamed I was all over it. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was horrible, horrible .... Ughh no words I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (one is for the really high bullet sounds, the sound staff did a good job)
