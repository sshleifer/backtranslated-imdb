*** SMALL SPOILERS *** This part of the Full Moon franchise changes history slightly and implements some new elements. First, a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the dolls are good in this sequel. Finally, it also introduces some scifi / fantasy elements. <br /> <br /> A new tenant of the infamous bay bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and the psychic girlfriend stumbled upon Andre Toulon's puppet sleeve. They also learn about some demons from another dimension who hold Toulon responsible for stealing the secret of animating the extinction. So Sutekh (the demon) sends totems, a bunch of craven little creatures that resemble earless gremlines. Then it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the interdimensional threat trying to kill there new friends. <br /> <br /> Like most low budget movies, this movie is abundant with continuity issues. How were the dolls put in the trunk? How come nobody remembers the last race of killngs in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why would a contractor of a building with history of mass murder? All this and many more questions will not be answered ... ever. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this movie is the actor. It's actually pretty good. The actors take it with an enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of Full Moon nonames. Teresa Hill was particularly impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise too. Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist. But Cameron was too annoying for the stomach. Thanks the Norwegian god, he dies before halfway through. <br /> <br /> The dolls are the usual animated ones. With some improvements too. There feelings (especially Jester's) are much more human because of the sounds that have been given to them. The blade lifts, Pinhead's grunts and Six-Shooter's snicker have all been improved and sound much better. The stop-motion animation is only average at best, especially the totems. They just don't seem to move as fluently as the previous installment rate. Also Sutekh costume is absolutely awefull. How should we be afraid of a being so humorous in appearance. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little juvinil for the series. I think Charlie Band would focus on a younger demographic. The violence is toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above is the biggest problem, this movie can't really hold on to many people. It does not have the violence for gorewhores. The language is a bit cleaner. Yet it is too violent and hard for the evil ones. Therefore, the film gets low ratings. I have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair.
