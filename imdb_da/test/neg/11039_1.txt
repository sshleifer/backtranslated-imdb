... So some people might argue that this can't be the worst movie ever made and no it isn't. I've seen movies with weaker plot, worse action, etc. So why do I hate this movie Ã¼ber alles? Well, it's basically about a man being kidnapped for years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but <br /> *** GREAT SPOILERS STOP READING if you don't want to know *** <br /> <br / > Our protagonist is at all fooled to have sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut his own tuna so his enemy won't tell her because she didn't know it. It's as humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. And why did he deserve this? Many years ago he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. He continued and told some people, and consequently she commits suicide. And viola, it's the brother who puts our protagonist through all this just for that. I wondered: Maybe I hate this movie so much because I think his punishment is too hard. Maybe because I feel that this movie does not condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I expected something else. <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our protagonist in the end, and I am very serious; Do you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt bad after watching this movie, and I really wish I had never seen it. It stayed with me for several days, and some could ask: Well, isn't it the purpose of a good movie? The ability to influence us in such ways? Yes, it may be, but this movie did not only get me sick, it made me feel offended.
