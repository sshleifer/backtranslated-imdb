If anybody at National Lampoon reads this, stop CRAP-DINING FROM YOUR BUM, really now! Why the hell are you making movies like these? They are not funny and see it because sexual content is a complete waste of time, really. It's such a horrible movie you might want to shoot yourself while you see it. I'm serious here, boys, it makes Harol and Kumar blah blah, looks like a really good movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst movies ever made). It really sucks, it really does. How bad is that? Well, even losers who actually resemble National Lampoon must hate this movie ... they want to murder the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lampoon, already die. Die.
