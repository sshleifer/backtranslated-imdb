In an up and down career with all kinds of movies, Altman is an attempt at science fiction, and it clearly shows that it's not his forte. The film is practically incomprehensible. It seems like a disastrous combination of experimental theater performances and a great studio trying to jump on the post-Star Wars bandwagon (not that this movie is constantly modeled on one, but one can imagine that the studio signed to hope for a lot of different Paul Newman sci-fi movie). The story is non-existent, the characters remain alien to us throughout. <br /> <br /> Altman has packs of dogs that feed on dead bodies throughout the film, which are clearly striving to do some sort of POINT. But since the film is so poorly thought out, starts with the lack of plot up, it is not about anything at all. <br /> <br /> The production is confused, the photography is undone at the edges and the score is terrible. However, "Quintet" has a redemption function. The film is not only filmed in the snow and ice, but also the interior becomes cold. You see the actors' breath in each scene. You really feel the cold.
