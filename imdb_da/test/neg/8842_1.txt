I'm looking at all the good reviews about this movie and I'm starting to think about myself ... Should I go wrong ...? Can't I see the beauty of a movie like this ..? Am I just stupid enough NOT to understand the message that this movie is trying to point out? I do not know. Maybe one of these lizards came into my head and also ate all my brains. The movie idea went nowhere ... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course ... it did! Nothing extraordinary ... Not even the landscape (I jumped to be placed in a mountain village at least the scenery would be nice .. but no). Just a lame story of a crazy teacher, and of course, the crazy students ... now all adults, each of them .. with their own firm ideas. And boy some of these ideas were stupid. Lizards story. For a moment I thought I saw x files .. with the lizard in the ear and everything. No. From my point of view, this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if you pay the ticket) The only part I liked was to act by the young blue eye "German" child ... He played very well and convincingly for his age ... the rest ... nothing! I read the previous review, and I think the scriptwriter and the director were both involved in drugs when they came up with these ideas. Well considering that there are many people who enjoy this movie ... I think about myself again .. Maybe I'm the crazy one. Counseling. Don't waste your time with this!
