my friends and i are always looking for chuck norris movies to just bash and have fun. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. i went to a wal-mart christmas shopping and i came across this movie in 5.99 bin. I had to get it. I had great hopes for this movie, and although we were sometimes funny, we agreed that innocent bells are the worst movie we have ever seen, made, produced, thought up, etc ... who in the hell would it be a good idea. It's not only confusing at times, but the play is just hard to see. The man who plays the ear, I can compare with my own vomiting, and chuck took a dive on this one, he is not the greatest actor, but it was terrible. and what kind of names are the ears, conrad and jux ........ jux. Come on people. If you honestly thought this movie was even visible, great to you because it was hard for me and I had severe headaches and abdominal pain after seeing it. I tell you now if you haven't seen this movie, DO NOT !!. For God's love, please do not submit to such a terrible 90 minutes of your life.
