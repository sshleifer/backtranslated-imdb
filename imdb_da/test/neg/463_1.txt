How can anyone even begin to like this movie is really beyond me. <br /> <br /> The idea? No one has it. "A guy fell apart". That's the idea. Wow. An environment slowly killed him ... now it's original and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I've seen ... I've heard he's a genius of the mise-one scene, but I've seen student movies with more attention, inspiration, idea and craft than this ... this .... this nothing. It has nothing! <br /> <br /> Every shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... The actor is horrible. You can see the actors did not have any preparation whatsoever, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it is so ... superficial ... The lines are so explicit that you could remove 90% of them and still has the same crappy movie. Tempo? Who cares about it. Atmosphere, dynamism, it's for pussy! One shot per Scene, 80% of the time people are staring unrealistically, have no idea how to represent the emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or another ... Editing? All editing rules have been ignored without any payment of any kind ... Photography? Half of the shots have reflection in them and crappy lighting without any stylization. Shadows, shadow games ... who needs it? We need a guy who pisses, drinks and hits his wife as if he's ... as he is acting. We need a bunch of close-ups of a not so beautiful woman ... we need an amateur climax of his capture of a compelling Arab torture ... This movie has so many reasons that it is not worth the no-budget it had. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I haven't seen a movie this badly since American Pie 5. Yup. I just started to see his "Veronica Foss" film, which seems much better, based on the first 15 minutes (as it has a hint of steering and artistic idea, unlike this crap), so I won't argue for that Fasbinder is clueless .... but this .... this movie SUCKS!
