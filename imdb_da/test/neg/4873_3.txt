MST3K feed. It's so bad it's actually worth looking for just that reason. There are some hilarious things in it that the mysterious entity the bad guy looks at, works for the entire movie, which turns out to be this little helicopter fluttering around carrying and shooting a machine gun without as much as a wobble but is brought down by a bag of balloons (the kind they release at political conventions). Many other wonderful handshakes of this kind. Stars Charlie Sheen. There is a scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation, accidentally losing only the micro cassette in the Potomac River. If they would throw Emilio Estevez in the part that would never have happened.
