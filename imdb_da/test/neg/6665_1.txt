There are so many logical errors in this show, it is hardly worth saying to me. 1) Mystic Gohan is non existent 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU still plays no role in the show, somehow he is easily overwhelmed by any bad guy 3) The whole Super Saiyan 4 idea is retarded and it is terrible that he loses to super 17 (which is the worst idea for a DB villain ever) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is no match for Super 17 but untransformed Goku using a move he learned in a movie that shouldn't happen, kill him with ease 5) Vegeta is completely useless 6) No sign than Goku has any impact on the outcome of the battle 7) The series ends with a bomb ... come again 8) Goku unbeatable? absorb dragonballs? lame 9) Gotenks? ... better yet Goten ??? Trunks ??? the sugar both 10) Super Saiyan 4 involves a magic transformation to an adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with the animation of Gogeta 15 ) Gogeta totally useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest failure in anime history (not really logical, but I go on a key) 17) Shortest character ever fighting <br /> <br /> I could go further if I had not suppressed most memories associated with this show. When I make enough money, I have to fund the remake of this series.
