This movie was so bad if anyone out of them starring in the movie, reading this, including the director, I hate you! LOL, the blonde woman running away, screams through the woods. At least spice less than scratch and stick to making DODGY HEAVY BREATHING !! and oh dear god, if it was the director who sorted the cameras on this, then go back to a normal job. No one wants to see any scared woman's hook through it. The lady, don't even think about renting / buying or even having a copy of this within the 100 meter radius of your house, as it can be detrimental to people who like good movies ... When I got home I thought id rented a pron movie of the camera's play and style.
