Medical student Paula Henning wins a place at an exclusive Heidelberg medical school. When the body of a young man she met on the train appeared on the dissection table, she began to examine the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, revealing a cruel conspiracy committed by an antihippocratic secret society operating in school. Disturbing and gross, many scary parts. It even has a good script and ends. But it has a poor part. What more can you see from this movie? It's a good mystery and horror movie. But of course, if you like it, you have to buy it. If you do not, there is still no reason to waste your money on this. Rating R for extreme graphic violence, sexual relationships and profanity.
