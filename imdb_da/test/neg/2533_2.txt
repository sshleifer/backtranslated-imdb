Nice with unnecessary song and scenery. Occasionally much of the action happens on the stage, which gives the feeling of an operation. None of that explains why it is such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There is the impression that there is not enough exercise or that no experienced choreographer was available. The action is flat. Even the sparkling Ziyi Zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next move or line. You can notice the trivia on this page, indicating that she spent half a month in Japan and learned to sign and dance. Read it again as 2 weeks and things start to make sense. Even worse are the little children who seem to look at their parents at the back of the studio rather than the camera. <br /> <br /> The cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. The editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except irritation. Imagine all the stupid dance scenes of the recent Zatoichi - especially the final routine - done by your local high school drama club with a famous actress who speaks in another language (but you simply get her in because she's so good normal, though it is unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited three times its length in no artful order.
