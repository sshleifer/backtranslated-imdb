I saw this "movie" partly because of the large number of good reviews on Netflix, and from that I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson on ethnic diversity but ... the lesson I learned is "Don't trust reviews". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to watch this movie are going to be the least attracted to it and least affected by it if they sees it. The only reason to think about the number of good reviews is that it is reviewed by people who are not used to thinking or who have seen their first thought-provoking film and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept . In fact, he basically made this film, called "Racism For Dummies", which emotionally scary as possible, apparently giving people who do not spend much time thinking the impression that they have discovered a fundamental truth that is never been covered by a movie before. Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it is not ... A post-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bitter-dried cut-off ham fist pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection. <br /> <br /> It's as if they were portraying everyone as the worst possible extreme, just to make us happy that we are so good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's see that people out. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they are all carton cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably inverted stereotypes). It is well-acted (though the dialogue is horrible) and wisely executed, so much so that you do not think to ask "where is beef?" Until you can tell the movie is winding down. The flaming car scene was well done, much like the movie, but did not end in the end. <br /> <br /> The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the "behind the scene", the producers clearly saw another movie because there is little to laugh about in this movie, even under certain fun parts. I must emphasize that this is not entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson ... it calls "blood on the highway" of racism. They could even show it in high schools if it wasn't for the "side-naked" shot of Jennifer Esposito. <br /> <br /> In this movie, everyone is a teacher and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pena who gets the best role but the most predictable story). This is a bad movie with bad writing and good actors .... an ugly comic book by Paul Haggis to people who can't handle anything but the bold lines in the story .... a picture painted with crayons. Crash is a depressing little thing that provokes feelings, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.
