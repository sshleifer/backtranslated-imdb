I just saw this early in the morning on the Fox channel completely by accident (my dog ​​woke me up) - I had seen it many years ago and thought I remembered it quite well. As a child I had had it. But now? As another poster commented, several of the wheels were out of order, and while it was disorienting in the beginning and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - it was just terribly surrealistic and entertaining. Music tracks for what I think was the big fundraiser show ("you're in show business, I'm in show business, most of the kids are in show business, let's put on a show") come out of nothing before all talk of making a show, and then without applause to completely independent "straight" scenes. The leading man's boyfriend turns out, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. I was half-awake and loved every crazy minute of it.
