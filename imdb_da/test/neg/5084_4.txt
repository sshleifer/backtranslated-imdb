It might have been exciting for an audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. I had a hard time sitting through it all and it was very predictable: I mean we know from the start of the movie that Welles is a Nazi war criminal and I will give you a guess as to whether he is trapped and Immediately punished at last. <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing. It's sad that Welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
