OK, I would give this a 1, but I'll give it a two because I laughed while I was watching this movie ... First of all, I can make a much better movie than this ... for a week ... The special effects made this movie look like a joke. One should not do such movies with terrible special effects, as people do not take it seriously. The action and direction were also horrible. The play had many plot holes, and the whole movie was not credible at all. This must be the worst Indian movie ever. The songs were also bad. The action was poor and artificial. Should I say more. Don't watch the movie unless you're curious to see how bad it is. That's why I saw it. I go into movies and I would see how bad a bad movie can get. Believe me, I saw one of the worst movies in the story of not the worst movie.
