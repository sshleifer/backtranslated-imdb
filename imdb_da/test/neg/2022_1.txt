The room is a vacuum, right? Therefore, the room sucks. Vampires also suck. A really bad vampire movie in the room would have twice the suction force, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun premise. Retelling Bram Stoker's Dracula story in the future. There is a mountain crew sent out to investigate a cargo ship lost in space called Demeter. Fans of the original novel will unconsciously assume that this should be a fair tale of Dracula in the future ... unfortunately, short to share character names, take the lowbrow route and enter the B movie galaxy twenty minutes later when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you he is the best actor in the movie and that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien will peddle his goods during the daytime. Erika Eleniak should have stopped when she left Baywatch and poor Udo Kier has trouble reading from the cue cards. The guy who plays Dracula in this one is more ridiculous than Frank Langella was in the 1970s version. If you manage to pass through the entire movie, you will be rewarded with the worst end imaginable. The end makes wondering if the actors and crew realized what a piece of garbage they did and went away from the set. <br /> <br /> Beware, vampire fans. This sucks twice as hard.
