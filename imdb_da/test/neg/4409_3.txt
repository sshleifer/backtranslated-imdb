How Many Monster Wood Films Can You See During Life? Now I want to go on a limb and say one. This movie is better seen late at night, with a 12 pack of beer, the sound and you and your friends settling on the dialogue. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific Islander, a young man is sentenced to death with the "evil Americans". (Seems his loving wife has slept with a witch doctor and they put him to death so the doc can be king.) He will promise to come back and avenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, the cool natives run to the American research cabin screaming "Tobanga is coming!" <br /> <br /> It seems that the young corpse has done just that Tobanga, the wandering wooden monster. Yes his revenge is awful (and this is also the movie). It seems that these natives cannot run from a carpentry tree, so he throws them in quicksand, rolls them down the hills, etc. Hurry soon, the new king will deal with his wife or rich for an ax or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> General issues with this movie are many. Comedy Relief is an unpleasant woman with a Cockney accent (which this movie needs comedy). You want her to die on her first appearance. The leading lady is whiny.The leading man is a boor.The acting is wood (pun intended). The dialogue is stiff and lumbering. Natives have Brooklyn accents. The monster suit is pure giggle. Although this is a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. It gets a 3 on unintentional laughing alone. Your dog can only consider it a little higher, but only if the tree was not mobile.
