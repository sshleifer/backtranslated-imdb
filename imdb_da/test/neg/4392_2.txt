I have little or no interest in seeing another horrible film that is completely missing something new creatively or fun, abusing the National Lampoon tag. Where ever did something get into the movie. I see Danielle Fishel's name I am a big fan of boy meeting the world! But the movie shes in is awful. More like a fan I am not rewarded by watching her terrible movie with the treasure of bare breast. So here's my question come in. Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, will Danielle Fishel be naked in it? Would save me the 2 hours of my life, I would never come back to see this horrible movie. Thank you
