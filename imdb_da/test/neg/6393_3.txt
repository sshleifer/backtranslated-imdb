Yes, I know the girls are warm and scenic, but for anyone who knows the place, it's fun. <br /> <br /> If you want accuracy, it's not a movie to trust. It starts with the flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio aboard a 747. This will never happen on the 400 km flight. Smaller aircraft such as 737 or A-320 passengers between the two cities every half hour. The drive from the airport's home, if shown on a map, will reveal an intricate zigzag back and forth. Perhaps the producers tried to imitate one of the well-known taxi cab drivers when they were confronted with tourists. Not that it would be a local habit that I myself was ripped off in very serious places like Switzerland. The girls yes All topless. That's something an outsider will never understand. Brazilian chickens will be happy to expose 100% of their incredible bodies to Samba Schools parades and wear almost non-existent bikinis on the beach but never go topless. A handful of beaches across the country will allow it. Everything carefully secluded and out of town. Oh, indoor decoration; the amazing wallpaper ... maybe in Disneyworld ... Apart from that, it's very entertaining and yes, Demi Moore is amazing.
