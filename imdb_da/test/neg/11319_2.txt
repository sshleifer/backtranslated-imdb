This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. Still, you can see things like PCs, emails, faxes, etc., used in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. <br /> <br /> So when should this guy tell this story - by 2020. Oh, I wonder how advanced we are then. How about telling us that. <br /> <br /> There are also several legal issues that do not make sense either. In the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual narratives of surprise evidence that cannot be considered in any court of law in that country. Also, Grandma should be missing at least seven years in most states before being declared officially dead. Congratulations Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially a SALE.
