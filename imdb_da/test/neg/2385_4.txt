What we get in this stunning trendy movie is a "frat-pack" of fellow friends approaching age 30 (as we all know, of course, their generation is thinking of "the new 20"). Comprising four guys and crazy, we have highlighted the following types: apparently "unemployed" and frequent drug users along with an individual who is job success and one who is trying to be. They are all in their own way driving while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness. With one, possibly two exceptions, these people, this reviewer would certainly never like to get close to modeling even after. There is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. Except in the case of an individual (appearing on the way to finding it), no one is heading toward emotional satisfaction in his / her life. And then if the only sincere moment in this movie is when a knock on the door brings the person who answers it, an unexpected and hearty "I love you." <br /> <br /> With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are hardly deserved or worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to throw away in presenting their stories. PS - Writer / director, Johnson, certainly seems to have a problem showing homosexual scenes - without such problems presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexuals. Why can it be? <br /> <br /> ****
