I can only assume that the previous posts came from execs at the production company ... <br /> <br /> attended British premiere last night. Zane and Brook attended (they certainly knew I should be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a movie. I felt sad at times when the audience laughed at the serious "thriller scenes". But perhaps I lacked the point. Perhaps an element of the tongue-in-cheek was calculated. If yes, pure genius. If not, career genocide. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Zane always shines and Brook can actually act a little. As the other half said (as we ran out into the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this movie, as they both act as nice people! However, the writer must be marooned.
