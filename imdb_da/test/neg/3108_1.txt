Crazy director .... Yes, you have to love to make a close film. Rob Lowe was bad in character, it's always bad, and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do with the movie. Crazy six is ​​an unknown movie, with some well-known actors ... it's pretty strange. A bad movie with some good actors in it. It looks like the bad movie had an impact on their performance ... It did! Crazy people ..... I give it * and a half out of *****
