The parallels between this movie and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so dazzlingly obvious that any praise for "Sally Marshall is not an Alien" must be seen with the knowledge that it runs on success of another work. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, respectively Dean Turner and Brett Allen) investigate the bizarre behavior of their new neighbor Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys look through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform as they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the main focus of Captain Walrus is on the exact and somewhat powerful actions of neighbor Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. A critical success at the film festival, plotted by Captain Walrus, has, of course, been granted and rehashed to give the Australian Film Community a different notch on the children's product. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien, a fine movie, and a credit to its producers, its inconsistency leaves something to be deserved.
