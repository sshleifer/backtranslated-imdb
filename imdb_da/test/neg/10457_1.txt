If you are like me and you occasionally enjoy watching horrible movies (I think it's a bit like slowing down by a car accident), you can't do better than this! The reason is inan, the special effects are fun and the play is one of the worst things you will ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and "actors" can sleep at night! It is painful and yet hysterically fun to watch and I highly recommend it to those who want to punish themselves. If you can see this crap without wincing, you are a better man than I will ever be! I wonder if the producer of this waste had any idea what he got himself (and his money) into!
