George Burns returns as the giant Almighty after having a great success with 1977's "Oh God!" A successful fantasy succeeded in a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comic redemption (though it made money, the original was more in line with the "Tops" comedies of the 30s than a return to good good religious movie theater). Here God looks to a young girl (Louanne, who previously had starring in a stage production of "Annie") and asks her to spread her divine word and cause her nothing more than adult problems in the process. Particularly family-oriented movies seem to be warm-hearted enough, and Burns gets along with a nice burst of anger jibes, but the writing is half slapstick and half serious, with the adults of the play contemplating putting little Louanne away, which makes God seem more like a troublemaker than an older friend. Louanne is another problem: a perky kid with wizened little eyes, she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. Media budget production has a gloppy, TV movie look, with few graceful hands. The final scene mimics the climax of the first "Oh God!" knowing that it brings a tremendous mood to the mix, which is welcome. It's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from ****
