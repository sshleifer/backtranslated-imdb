This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his biography 'Wired', written by Bob Woodward. All movies are told about flashback without a chronological order, where after John Belushi's death we see an angel accompany Belushi under few points of his life. Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is probably credible, but completely devoid of the devastating power of Belushi, and his game remains only a pale animation. The director no longer survives on the past of history, for who does not know the book, it is very confused. But the worse is that they have presented Bob Woodward, who spoke to Belushi before he died. For these negative points, the movie is only a desirable attempt to tell the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.
