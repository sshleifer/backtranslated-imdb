I would like to start by saying that I would not see this movie again if they gave popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was horrible. I cannot give this a truly honest assessment because there are no negative stars. The action is absolutely horrible. This movie is a travesty based on the classic "The Dangerous Game". If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like Gigli. At least J-Lo gives some better scenery, Ben should pacify the ladies who see it. I'm not worried about the $ 7 I paid to see the transition, I just want the 90 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me my time back?!" Samuel L. Jackson, changing lanes
