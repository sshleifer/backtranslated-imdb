With Knightly and O'Tool as leaders, this movie had good opportunities and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tensions. But they threw it all away on the silly evening and then later with maudlin war remains. It was, of course, superficial, beautiful English country and coast or not. The first mistake celebrated dumping just as early in the movie as she could easily have played someone a few years older rather than choosing someone ten years older to play that part. They missed all the chances of having a great conflict between the cast, and instead stupidly drawn to the simple and cheap heartbeat.
