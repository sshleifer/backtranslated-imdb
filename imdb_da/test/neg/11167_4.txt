This is a rip-off of already crappy Hollywood movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school students try a prank on the class' asthmatic misfit, but something goes wrong. Terribly Wrong When you watch the movie, you know what will happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they are Asian), so I give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.
