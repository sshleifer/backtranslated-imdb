Oh God! Oh God! Oh dear! <br /> <br /> Thinking that movies like this were made, and probably enjoyed by thousands at driveways, really scares the mind. How innocent we were these days. <br /> <br /> To put it all, this movie is crap. The hero is so wet that you can hear his clear damp footsteps in each scene. My lord, but he is just one of a whole bunch of horrible, horrible actors appearing in this turkey. No wonder MST3K picked it. The story, as it is, centers around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really think it's the actor driving the car) that he gives up and "goes into the wrong crowd" Oooooh! Scary things. But the wrong crowd turns out to be the biker equivalent of The Three Stooges and their "hand-me round" veil of a biker chick. As an example of how lame the whole thing is, the authors clearly proclaimed their brains to come up with a scary name for the biker band - if four people can be called a gang, then it is. The result? The band is called Satan's angels! I'm not killing you. <br /> <br /> Such a sharp play and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, creates a wonderful beer and chips movie. But otherwise it's just the worst kind of nonsense. <br /> <br /> As I said. Once this may have been considered good. But today it just makes you laugh (and crawl) with every minute that passes. Avoid it except for a good laugh. And make sure you are more than half-drunk too!
