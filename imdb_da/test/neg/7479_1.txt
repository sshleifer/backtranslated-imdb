He seems to be a control freak. I heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and telling another guest who brought live animals that he had a rule - "no snakes". He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are paralyzed. The only reason I see him is because he has some good guests and bands. <br /> <br /> I watched the Craig Ferguson show for a while, but his show is even worse. He likes to shake sh ** to burn time. I don't think either one has much of a future in late night talk shows. Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. He must do this at least 10 times a show. I like the Joe Firstman band. Carson Daily should light up before it's too late.
