movies I've ever seen. In fact, I find it one of the more entertaining episodes of the MST 3000 I've seen. Not that it was good, but for anyone who has seen Manos: The Fed's hands know that this was not two bad ones. The monster in the movie looked terrible, everyone had terrible swimsuits, and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they did the monster, they never gave really good reason. The leading woman had to be the frightening gal I've ever seen. They would have done better if they threw bugs that were killed in the beginning as the lead. On the plus side, the dolphins appearing was great !!!
