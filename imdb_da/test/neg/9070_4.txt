Attractive man and wife writing team Robert Wagner (like Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (like Donna Gregory) arrive at the spooky manor of actress "Lorna Love" (actually posed movie star Harold Lloyd's house). Mr. Wagner and Ms. Jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star's biography. Wagner has a personal interest in the project when his father was once the famous star lover. Mysterious events unfold, and Jackson must fight to save his husband from the beautiful blonde's spirit, "perfectly preserved" in a crypt on the property; Moreover, the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband and killing Jackson! <br /> <br /> This is a very "Night of Dark Shadows" variation, contributing to true "Dark Shadows" alumni Kate Jackson who knows and plays their part well. Robert Wagner lacks David Selby's intensity. Sylvia Sidney (like Mrs. Josephs) sidestep Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good at a part that would have been played by John Karlen (in a Dan Curtis production). There are smooth comos by Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour. Mrs. Lamour's delivery is similar to Joan Bennett, who asks the question: Why did the producer Aaron Spelling produce no more of the original "Dark Shadows" regulars? <br /> <br /> Director E.W. Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband; He worked with Mrs. Blondell on "Here Come the Brides" and with Jackson on "The Rookies". "Death at Love House" has a tighter story than the "Night of Dark Shadows" movie; it differs in the angle of the film star; and in its "Father's Eternal Fire" it ends more like the TV series "Laura the Phoenix" story. <br /> <br /> **** Death on love house (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
