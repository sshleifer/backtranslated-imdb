The GOVERNMENT is a moody period, a chronic story of a Jewish woman who, after her father's death, sits down to the 1830's Scotland and is a pagan to work to support his family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, as she calls herself a not too subtle piece of symbolic writing - is a ruthless child, a socialite-dreaming socialite. She creates an alliance with her employer and accidentally solves a crucial problem in her photography research. Giddy successfully, they begin a stopping and unpleasant affair while the eldest son of her farewell falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with her. <br /> <br /> And as a child, she doesn't understand the consequences of her actions - eventually betraying them, she was deceived to make a living for herself. <br /> <br /> Many claim that this is something of a feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Whether it's intended or not, this movie only resonates with me if I think of it as a warning. Eventually, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth - that she lied, happened in a way to help a man, she wanted to be both her father and her boyfriend and finally contributed only to destruction. As such, the end of the movie gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one she used, made her happy - and that's exactly what it should be. <br /> <br /> Do I need a movie so long and langorous to teach me this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, if it hadn't been for excellent filmography, outstanding scores and my hope that she would get her to come, I wouldn't be stuck with it until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of Minnie Driver will probably be disappointed with her uneven performance, but may want to see it anyway; I doubt that young female fans of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers will be able to stay awake for the payout they expect, and I cannot help thinking that this has too little cultural detail to be of interest, even to photography buffs. The 3 points I assign to the movie are solely for their visual style and score. Because of their other work, I assume that the actors' notions are so disappointing because of a bad script and poorer governance, but ultimately they are unnoticed.
