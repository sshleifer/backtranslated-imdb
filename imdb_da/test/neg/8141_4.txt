Certainly not a bad little low-budget movie, this "Gorilla Gorilla", but nothing special, neither memorable nor enough to be ranked among its meaningful Sci-Fi efforts from its time. Director Curt Siodmak was a prominent writer in the 1930s and 1940s and delivered stories to some genuine genealogists ("I went with a zombie", "The Wolf Man"), but of course he lacked the necessary skills as a director. "Gorilla's Bride" looks like the aforementioned "The Wolf Man" in history and atmosphere, but the movie looks much more amateurish and pitiful. Both handle cursed men who turn into big animals at night, but the titular gorilla doesn't look half-threatening as a werewolf, even though the film was released a decade later. During a cheesy opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a vicious place and stores many mysteries, but in fact there is no real mystery in the plot. It's just a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him. A native woman bears witness to his crime and spells Barney, who turns him into an ugly gorilla at night ... Or maybe she just wants him to believe that he is going to be an ugly gorilla ? Lon Chaney himself plays the police commissioner accused of the murder investigation, while Raymond Burr (who played in about a thousand Perry Mason TV films) portrays the greedy plantation manager / nocturnal gorilla. Siodmak trying to make the movie look like a supernatural thriller ?? is it or does it not just happen in Barney's head? ?? Fails and it causes too much to talk and too few jungle actions. Several of the jungle settings are nicely depicted, but the rest of the "special" effects are sticky and poorly finished. Still the play is pretty good, Barbara Payton looks beautiful and ?? although very predictable ?? The story is strangely convincing until the end. Strange movie, it's probably voodoo-cursed me ??
