go with your camcorder, your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door throwing boiling water on the raccoons; and you got yourself a movie! Well, that's what these guys thought anyway. It was so bad, I can't even remember the majority of it except flashbacks that are comparable to anyone who toured in 'Nam. In spite of the correct corny title, the terrible quality, the terrible actors and the clich√©, I think this movie is not the worst I have ever seen. I save the space for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam. Anyway, if you're out of options when it comes to finding new horror movies that you haven't seen 1000 times already (as I was) and you're debating this, I'd still skip this one. It had absolutely no redeeming qualities. This mock serial killers thriller was a weak, neat attempt at a straight B movie. If they are really lucky, it can make Wal-Mart $ 4.50 bin. but I doubt it a lot.
