This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time. In the first 10 minutes I was already annoyed, as I am familiar with the real version of the story according to the Torah (5 books of bogs) ... but I decided to see it to get my money's worth and also see how bad it sucked . Well it sucked ... more than I thought it would. First and for most, let's start with the script and the characters skeleton that makes up a movie's body. If you study the Torah at all, you will see that the story is wrong. Here are some of the horrible mistakes: Moses does not slave labor because he was in the tribe of Levi, Moses does not kill anyone in Mount sinai. . But still the film shows that he is being whipped and aaron and even killing people ... reeeealllly not! When moss speaks to the burning bush, he knows who he is talking about, but the film makes moss look like an idiot, he says he doesn't know who the gd in the bush is ... whatever | Aaron breaks his brother well whatever their distance grew up, Aaron was known for his quiet, compound peaceful nature, yet he is depicted as sour and arrogant in this movie. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie .. how ridiculous .... pharoah the real was actually and ugly dwarf sitting on a pyramid of stairs so he could get bigger when he was and bog was more than 10 feet and in the movie pharoah is taller than him and hes hot with bright eyes! Israel's Woman (Israel's Land) covered their significance for their hair and organs, and they did not dance or sing to men, they did not participate in the Golden Calf, so they would definitely not dance with a man in public as the film depicts Moses' wife Tzipora was married to moss, and she covered herself and was as humble as they did not hug or hold hands in public. Batia Pharoah's daughter (the one who adopts him and rescues him from the water) who has actually been converted to Judaism, and therefore would have been proud of Moses when he said he would escape his people. Quickly to mount sinai moses comes down the 2nd time with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish writing on it .. put least font in the sacred tongue, Hebrew or English and place it on a tablet not two sets .. Bottom line is the movie is terribly written, corrected and the characters are all wrong. Basically everything is wrong about the movie ... The old one is also inaccurate, but it is more realistic and the actors are credible. Is Israel Chai!
