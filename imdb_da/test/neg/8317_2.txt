I don't know which neighborhoods the people who wrote rave reviews for this movie live in, but I'm glad I'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonishness of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in movies like the "Die Hard" series, but look a little Jodie knocking a whole street gang, with a Glock, like a NOVICE yet ... c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a torn T-shirt and she would be Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jodie was the executive producer, blinded her to what a joke and a waste of money would be. Or she lived a kind of fantasy, where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black or Spanish-speaking. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good one and (except a black police officer) everyone else in the city is some unpleasant minority to get her. Has your fear of your acting talent fallen so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) on the camera in a dark morose and gloomy neighborhood / movie / cast? Apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous plot holes, furniture chewing acting, free violence ("See girls! Now you can do it too!"). .. Tighten the time with your family instead of seeing this dragon.
