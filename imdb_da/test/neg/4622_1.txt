This is the only movie that represents everything that is bad in the film industry. The actors are pathetic and the manuscript is terrible. The special effects, if any, are so badly done that it would have been better to do it with cartoons instead. Besides that, it's great! I think the filmmakers had it with humor, but the only time I laughed was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and the colorful costumes that everyone had. The scenes at the end were good, but they were not part of the movie. In the end, you ask yourself "why did I waste my time and money with the lap when I could have seen the plants grow or the clouds are moving". I don't think I'm a critic or something, but it's a real lame movie! WILL NOT SEE! STUPIDITY OVERLOAD DANGER!
