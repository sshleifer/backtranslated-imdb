If you've never read the classic science fiction novel this mini-series is based on, it might actually be good. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you will probably not be able to see more than the first hour or two. All the political intrigues are taken out of the movie, the main scenes from the book are taken out, the character motifs have been completely changed and words from the wrong characters mouth. Where in the short story Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with incredible political skill and a good understanding of the way the world worked. In this movie, he is warm and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
