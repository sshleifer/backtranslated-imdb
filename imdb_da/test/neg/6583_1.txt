Like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still image - it doesn't look that bad. But when people start to move, it's terrible. Uneven jerky movements, scary lack of emotion and lack of sense of life in the face give me creeps. The signs do not even appear ALIVE / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview screening with my daughter who actually fell asleep! She was not engaged at all. For the record, I thought she could easily engage with both Pixar-esque movies and a number of the 'bad' 2D movies like Sinbad. The lighting is painful and gives the kids the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin on a bonfire. Lip synchronization is poor - worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously consider having Hanks play five characters .... it was a big distraction throughout the movie. The conductor's role is scary - even though I somehow can't figure it out. It reminds me of my father's false phone call when I greet clients. I think that's why more roles are distracting - you're acutely aware that the voice is the same, but differently different. It gives each character the feeling of being ACTED, as opposed to being real human characters. Reality's illusion is broken by Hank's multiple role-playing games. I've seen the technique work - let Eddie Murphy, but Hanks just can't get it off with a voice alone, given the horrible animation. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't waste my money on this - wait for the rent.
