I can't believe the high marks people have given this movie on this page. Scripture is incredibly bad when people come in at the right time and reveal exactly what the heroine is trying to escape. (Don't you just hate it when it happens?). And the play is so much, very bad, that you can get a splinter in the eye from all the scenery chewed. <br /> <br /> A nut holds hostage, children are out of the open screen, so she falls for help instead of screaming, just a moment ago being brave enough to smash windows to shout for the same children. <br /> <br /> She is finally free and alone in the house. Her chance to go for help, then what does she do? Wanders around the house and lying down. She's in the basement, locked away. So what does she do? Takes a little nap. Come on! Most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the author is too sad to actually write a real plot, why should we pay attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a game for the radio, so they followed with the heroine just sitting instead of pretending to be screenwriters and actually writing something. <br /> <br /> And the end is horrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is absolutely incredible, terribly written and almost comic. Beware of this movie at all costs!
