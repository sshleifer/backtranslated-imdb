Yes, it is true that it was Jessica Alba who leads me to this movie because without her I should never have chosen it. <br /> <br /> But I find it far boring and above all unoriginal. All the time I thought the story was full of clich√©s and led very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and author are the same person. I notice to remember to avoid all his next movie. It's a shame because all good things were present: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire, and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and once she has found a suitable movie for this. Bob Hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won a prize for this role. The only positive thing is that it makes me open a world map to find this island because if you guess it's happening in South Asia, you don't know how accurate it is! Oh, the little flight of red lines in the Indiana Jones movie !!!
