There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to pick a few. Let's start with the stupid and annoying songs. Just like the "Ride Little Cowboy", who just used to emphasize the appearance of Klinton Spilsbury's city lick. The stupid kiddie cowboy songs that take place in the background under the film hurt any credibility or speed that the story was on. <br /> <br /> I had seen media hype before this movie was released and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewing on various TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered as fans of the Clayton Moore and Lone Ranger TV series. Spilsbury did not help by acting as a diva and talking about Clayton Moore after the producers got a ban banning Moore from appearing on conventions and other events like the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as "Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger." He could only sign as "The Masked Man." The incredible amount of negative advertising that this feature gave the movie was only added by Spilsbury's grim attitude, which was very quick to tell journalists that Clayton Moore would soon be forgotten when the movie came out! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even after the movie was a total flop, the company that owned The Lone Ranger refused to lift their dedication to Clayton Moore, and he was never again allowed to sign anything except "The Masked Man "and he could not make his black mask any public appearance. Between Spilsbury's diva personality and the negative advertising film, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. Worse yet, a few weeks before the film was finally released, the news was leaked that Spilbury's voice in the movie had been exaggerated by James Keech because the producers believed Spilsbury didn't sound very convincing as a cowboy. The ridicule and fate that this news brought to the talk shows and comedy show of that era put the last stitch in the coffin. But then there was Merle Haggard, who tells herself through the film. Apparently, the producers hoped that Haggard's macho image (one of Outlaws of Country Music) would increase the credibility of Spilsbury as The Lone Ranger. The story from Merle Haggard was just another annoyance the audience had to deal with. At times, Haggard inhibits his story, and it sounds like a strange kiddie movie. Combine holding the story with "Ride Little Cowboy" songs and any credibility that Spilsbury could have patterned was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horse, and as others have pointed out, Horse had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because of Spilsbury's allegedly struggling attitude during the recording, Horse seems to have much more dialogue and screenplay than anyone had expected from Tonto. Tonto takes responsibility and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I waited (or hoped) that Billy Jack would make a cameo like Tonto's brother (it would have made the movie much better). Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but he says more and has better scenes. Maybe it was a case of horse stealing the show from Spilsbury. But when the film was so miserable, horses didn't get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, Horse has a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last negative about this movie is the powder blue outfit of The Lone Ranger. The material chosen for Spilsbury was more powdery blue than Clayton Moore's usual appearance. The choice of color for outfit that has just made Spilsbury look more in its role. The cartoon version had also shown The Lone Ranger wearing a red shirt and black pants, and the alternative outfit would have helped Spilsbury look more convincing like The Lone Ranger. Support model mostly sent in their performances. They all look as though they were working on a television episode, and no one seemed very convincing. Even the villain lost Cavendish's edge because of the people around him. Overall, I'm sorry about Spilsbury. Not only did he make a terrible play, but it was clear that production and advertising were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had. Even if he had been an excellent replacement for Clayton Moore, I doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors. As it stands, this movie is fun in a sad way.
