If at all possible, try to see all five of the universal "Mummy" movies in sequence, not so much for the continuity between films, but for the very obvious lack thereof. It goes without saying that the original Boris Karloff classic "The Mummy" really should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the so-called "sequels", which all come out as campy or cultish. <br /> <br /> This time, it is revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka have made their way to the United States. And once again, as your eyes deceive, Kharis the Mummy didn't really die for the second time in "The Mummy's Tomb," but lives and searches for his lost love Princess Ananka using the rhetorical nine-tailed leaves brewed during the full-moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a caretaker filled with a giant John Carradine as Yousef Bey, entrusted with the task of George Zucco's Andoheb, high priest in Arkan. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka must be returned to their final resting place in the Ark of the Hills of Egypt. But as we have seen before, a sure priest for a high priest is bound to end in failure, with Carradine's character falling to the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It is shocking to see Yousef Bey and the PO'ed bandaged man coming to blow over the beautiful Amina. <br /> <br /> Undo this - in both "Tomb" and "Curse", Lon Chaney shows the mummy with a shacky right arm folded helplessly over his chest. When he meets the weak Amina, he lifts her up in both arms without difficulty. As soon as he puts her down, his right arm goes back to the stunted position again. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is most remarkable - the monster gets the girl! But it is a short-lived victory when the mummy and his kidnapped bride succumb to a swampy tomb, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled - "The fate of those who speak the will of the ancient gods must be a cruel and violent death".
