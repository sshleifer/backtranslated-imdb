I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was totally surprised at how wrong this movie was. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what made him part of this travesty. The biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and I honestly could not see the movie with my children. My children were astonished because even they knew Lot didn't even believe when Noah built the ark. I believe that NBC should be ashamed of themselves to allow manufacturers to blaspheme the Word and even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! !! I have considered burning my copy, but I have every intention of writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they should have read before they made this movie !!!
