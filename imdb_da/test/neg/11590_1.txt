Where do I start? First, the story sucks. The sugar action, the effects really suck, I think I start with the story. The story of Komodo vs Cobra: number one, it doesn't explain how or when Komodo and Cobra themselves came there. Or for that matter how it was created. Actor: AWFUL! It seems that the director just pulled a few people off the street (which is probably what he did). And last and definitely the effects: they are so terrible that komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when cobra appears. All in all: terrible piece of shit, don't even think about renting it.
