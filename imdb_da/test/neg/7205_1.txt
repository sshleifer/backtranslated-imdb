I couldn't spoil this piece of shit if I wanted to. After seeing Dark Harvest 1 I thought "it must be the worse movie ever made", so I saw Dark Harvest 2 and it made 1 seem a little better. Then I saw Dark Harvest 3 or tried too. All I have to say is, "When should this end?" Very bad acting and really bad special effects the only good thing about this movie was the boob shot. Don't waste your time on money on this piece of shit ... And now I have to write 3 more lines to get this to submit. I had to sing a song, but I can't think of anyone right now. But the movie finally ended (although it had an end that could mean they would make another one of these)
