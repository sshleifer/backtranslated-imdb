I am a chess player and I would like this movie. The problem is that the content could have been mounted in a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were lots of corridors shot down and Kasparov looked out into the hall where he won the World Cup. There were other shots of Kasparov who went around since the 1997 fight and were told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was located. It just looked like filler. <br /> <br /> Also, I didn't find it interesting to see details where Deep Blue was now seeing an IBM techie trying, without "successfully" opening it. What would we have seen of interest inside anyway - a little grandmaster? <br /> <br /> Also the latest fight against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was. It would have been nice to have been told: was this a one-time "just for the money" measure? Was it part of the World Cup? What was the end result? The nub of the movie was played in the game two. Could IBM want Kasparov to look inside the machine? This was where the focus should have been.
