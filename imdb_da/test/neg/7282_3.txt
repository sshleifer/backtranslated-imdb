So it's come to this. In the best commented comment on this flick, someone says "Nishi is a reputable man". Really? This is a guy who mainly kills and helps people in the movie. He takes a short break to rob a bank. Honorable? How would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls it honorable? Wait, there's more! The person also says "we can tell that he is constantly thinking." How can we do that? Well, you know, "How can you tell when a CEO / politician / lawyer is lying?" ... "his / her lips move." Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I think it means he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. Existentalism apparently emphasizes that an individual takes responsibility for the consequences of one's actions. Not Nishi. Loan money from yakuza. What do they want back? Kill them. The police find out. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really reputable.
