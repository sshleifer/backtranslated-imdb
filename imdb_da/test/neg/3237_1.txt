It's hard to believe that everyone could take such a big book and make such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine King Kong being reworked as an organ clipper's monkey and Fay Wray's part being played by a young boy. What about Elton John as Rambo !!!! This movie is even worse than the television remake of Hunters Night. <br /> <br /> Using the title Watchers and Dean Koontz's name, the film's decision makers have to be sued for book readers' fraud, expecting a fairly accurate book adaptation. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I've never talked to anyone who didn't like it. Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi.
