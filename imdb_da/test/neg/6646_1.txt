I've seen this movie, but not in a single meeting. What happens that it plays on the TV, I look for a few minutes, find that I have everything I can take, and then leave the room. During these few minutes I do not even laugh, experience no pleasure in what I see and find myself more depressed so sour. Interestingly, I have been told that the psychological conditions are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This film tests this theory. I think part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago, so I see the scenes, I think of my own experiences in the rotten city and thus I am bringing a lot of luggage to pieces. It is quite possible I am willing to admit that if you are not a Chicago denizen, you will find the play entertaining. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> And yet. John Hughes made his film in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first-rate writer. I find it obvious that he knew how to comically balance his situations, and make his characters both sympathetic and credible. In a comedy (as separate from a farce), this balance is crucial. And it is not easy to achieve. If that were all would make good movies, and we wouldn't have to worry as we do in the real world, wondering when genius will ever be shown. In "adventure in childcare" it does not. I hated these signs. <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and genuine, between sympathetic and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor, no humanity, no people can be recognized. Only actors read their lines as if all they can do to limit themselves from screaming them out, sure that finally hilarity will follow, this time for sure! It's like seeing antics of very bad comedians. It is embarrassing and after a while, usually at the time I get up and leave, I begin to feel compassion for all concerned, which is a kind of emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is horrible. She is not acting, certainly not acting comically, and it is quite possible that she cannot. But gentleman, how she tries. She looks older than 17, and seems so younger younger than a seven-year-old burden on a school, probably playing that is how you get a prize. And she's not alone. It's like everyone can't relax and let the story flow. As if everyone just has no idea what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Now this was an early effort for Chris Columbus and he would definitely help improve and have better writers (eg John Hughes himself) so maybe some forgiveness is in order. But the movie is just a series of desperation. But like I said it may work for some. If any of the above appeals to you and it obviously did some of the reviewers, then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise avoid this mess like you would a dark Chicago alley where as you hurry, you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.
