The story of the bridesmaid is an entertaining and engaging one, and it is for the filmmakers' credit that he sets out to portray rural Minnesota with the same respect as usually reserved for Coast dwellers. However, it is strange to find an independent film, a unit's brainchild, which is as unambitious and clich√©-ridden as a canned-brewed Hollywood pot boiler. <br /> <br /> Rural portrait is meant to be loving, I think, but these characters don't really speak to me - I've had a lot of small town meals, but never overheard a debate on the benefits of different English writers from it 19th Century. One can suggest that author / instructor Semans has no more rural experience than the Coen brothers, and significantly less satirical enlistments.
