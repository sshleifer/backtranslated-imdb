Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why become a horrible script like this initially approved. It's not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it's not properly explained to the audience! <br /> <br /> To get the wife to explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad. Having such a tight editing for battle scenes is also bad! Such imaginative editing is only shown in trailers. It trills the whole look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russian guys at the top of the movie? Who is the guy being tortured? Is he with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This movie did not deserve to be released in theater. But it does not deserve to be produced in the first place. It's a Hollywood joke.
