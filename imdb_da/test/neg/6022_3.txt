This movie was an absolute waste of time. It's nothing but a will-be gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are unsympathetic to the characters, and the dialogue is at best mediocre. Half of the time you are looking for something else to do because the movie is so boring, as you already know what will happen. The other half of the time you desperately hope for the protagonist grows a few balls or just finishes his life by jumping out of a bridge or something. The secondary characters are also mostly one-dimensional. There is no depth for any of the characters in this movie! No depth!
