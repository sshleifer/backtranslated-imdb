I hadn't seen this for many years. The action was as good as I started this time, I thought, "Fantastic! Another movie I misjudged as a foolish young man." But then the theme began to be clear and I felt the same. <br /> <br /> This was Hollywood, the glamor chair; so the concept should not be a surprise. But it's so disappointing a concept I feel as though I have to take a bath after seeing it. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is sympathetic to the domestic heroine. She seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make-up. Robert Young is wounded in the war and feels scarred. His parents can't bear to look at him either. He seems to have all his faculties, and in part the concepts of disability are outdated. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is present as a blind pianist. His character speaks are sharp tones and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as the owner of the title residence. She is bitter and dour but not made of ice. Her story is much more interesting and credible than McGuire and Young's.
