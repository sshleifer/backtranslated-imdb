MacBeth, I have always believed, is the most accessible of Shakespeare's 'Great Period' games. Compact, focused, with lots of violence, it should have been the game that was most open to screen customizations. However, I am not aware of a really good reproduction of the story - the best effort is Orson Welle's powerful shoestring version. In the list of MacBotches, we must add the Connery / Baxendale bet. <br /> <br /> (It seems that it was not a "movie fit" at all, but a television release that was given a theater release, after Luhrman's Romeo + Juliet and Branagh's Hamlet. Its wrong, but do not apologize for it.) It starts well, with a feisty fighting sequence of pleasing pigs witches watching. Poor old Gray Malkin and Paddock are cut from the opening scene, but they are not alone for long. In quick succession, they are confused by the bloody Sargent and his account of the battle, Tane of Cawdor's betrayal, the unfortunate master of Tiger, even MacBeth's meeting with Duncan when he is invested as one of Cawdor. All of these had virtues that used the angels to trumpet the tongue against the dark condemnation of their sending, but they were dismissed. Nor are they the only cuts. This is MacBeth in a hurry. From the opening match we are directly into MacBeth's meeting with the witches, which is well done. Brian Blessed curiously asked the witchy sequences and he has fun with the special effects that MacBeth and Banquo are told about their fate. Jason Connery as MacBeth is awkward, of course unsure of what to do about the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is able to make his lines natural and easy. Within a few minutes of Connery's mumbling, the viewer is craving to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the title role. No wonder MacBeth thought he needed to kill him. <br /> <br /> These first few minutes mark the film's highlight. From here we move to Helen Baxendale, who receives a word from her husband. She is as lost as Connery, and denied the beard which he gets to hide behind. Her "Unsex me here" call of evil is embarrassing, not disturbing. There are some reasonably wise features - MacBeth's "We Will Speak on" is not a sign of his hesitation in relation to his wife's evil ambition, but his attempt to chalk her prattling when he throws her on the bed. <br /> The action of the leaders is the biggest disappointment. Connery's method is to stare glazed on the screen while mumbling his monologues via voice-over. Baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. An attempt to make something interesting with "Is this a dagger" - the amazing dagger is a shadow cast by an intersection on an altar - falls flat due to Connery's poor delivery and slumbering direction, which marches the production throughout. We accompany Lady MacBeth back in the murder chamber, where she will stab the reviving Duncan, but the effect is cartoon, not dramatic. Big scenes are bleached - Banquo's look at the party is made incomprehensible through attempts to blend the subjective representation of MacBeth's delusion with what they see or do not see around him. The second meeting with the witches is even less coherent, and the prophetic visions are confusing. Timing seems to be a problem here - Banquos Banquet is the key point of the game, but the movie is moving rapidly towards conclusion after that, giving it an unbalanced feeling and no scope for the complicated streets MacBeth is trapped in being appreciated, or for his descent into madness to be convincing. Another crucial cut is the scene where Malcolm tests MacDuff, and MacDuff learns about the murder of his family. This deprives its revenge of most of its emotional power - and the nature of a lot of screen time. He is a virtual stranger when he turns out to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> A point to try. MacTavish's Banquo serves another. The first few minutes garnish another. But that's all. From then on, it is sound and rage blah blah blah.
