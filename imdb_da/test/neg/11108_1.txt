This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie that stares Rhys Davies, where it's hard to determine what's worse, the actor or writing / controlling / producing (John Sheppherd helms all three.) Basic story: obsessed extobiologist captures chubacabra monster, it smuggles a cargo container aboard a cruise ship escapes and the carnage begins. Clich√©d sci fi cast by the robust captain with the beautiful daughter, beautiful heroes and angry scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist statement to the ship (as it obviously wouldn't believe in a monster story.) No dramatic helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here. Budget only allowed for the entire power of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ship wench aboard. Puleeze. Also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. I also loved since Seal Commander looking through standard binoculars from ten miles away could see three people jumping off the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel continues with original movies, I hope they realize that the audience is not kindergarten and buying better scripts and directors. If this was direct to video, you would find it in 99 cents bin.
