Erroneously and cynically, the 'Hospital' represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky's special mark of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to hammered director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous script becomes visually ugly, poorly paced presentation it deserves. <br /> <br /> Only a great achievement by George C. Scott, in the kind of spiritual role he was born to play, keeps "The Hospital" from being a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Scott's performance makes viewers a mockery. His magnetism keeps them looking at when they can turn off the video recorder more profitable and clean the cabinets, stare in the clouds or look at Baywatch again. <br /> <br /> It is certainly anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up modern medicine apparently gone crazy will feel cheated by the gloomy payout that Chayefsky reveals that the system works just fine, so end your carping. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this movie gives some entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. However, before it becomes clear, Chayefsky gives some good lines to Scott as his medieval, middle-class, white male stand-in. <br /> <br /> Bitter, Alcoholic, Impotent, Scotts Dr. Herbert Bock has alienated those who know him best and he has the gall to keep alien ones. Of course, in Chayefsky's world view, all of that makes a magnet for a hippie chick half of his age. <br /> <br /> Playing a collection of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost bust-less Diana Rigg fights in that part of the 'girl'. The British Rig is mistaken for a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress will also fight. As the rest of a good throw has gone into play, Rigg cannot overcome a script that is not interested in any character except Bock, or any philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott, this is another star swing and worth seeing. For fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For anyone else, don't bother.
