This is another notorious Mexican horror movie: While the original Spanish version is pretty pretty, all kinds of gore and nudity were put in for the English-duplicated variant (compiled by Jerald Intrator - who had similar duties at THE CURIOUS DR. HUMPP [1967/71 ] - and as the American version of that movie, had previously been available on DVD through something weird / picture! <br /> <br /> I saw the original first, and although it wasn't so good to shake it, it was pretty engaging - especially with a plot as we know it: a doctor goes beyond the call to try to save his life of his terminally ill son; he even has a caving, game-legged assistant (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who had set a strikingly similar role - albeit in a more vicious vein - in the COURSE OF THE CROSSING WOMAN [1961]). I know that several Mexican films mixed horror with the "Lucha Libre" (Wrestling) genre, but I had never looked at myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles may have happily been separated (that is, the wrestling sequences are cleverly done, with some of the movements being very entertaining). The doctor's son has been transformed into a monster (resembling The Incredible Hulk with mud sprinkled over his face!) after having an aps heart transplanted in him - but as it is replaced with a comatose female wrestler, he remains on this way and growing a few fangs to start (he must not have realistically turned into a transsexual ... even though I think it would not have been very interesting) !! The climaxic order in which the monster kidnaps a child and fulfills his death in the hands of the police reminds of FRANKENSTEIN's GHOST (1942). My favorite accidental funny moments in the movie, however, happens when the doctor tries to comfort his son, telling him that he will soon be healed - only to turn his back on tears - and also the impatient appearance he gives his curly assistant (like the latter slowly stays in the car when they are chasing the monster escaped from the laboratory. <br /> <br /> The alternative nude scenes work for the movie (these were actually performed by Cardona himself for a racier Mexican version entitled HORROR Y SEXO), but its reputation is largely based on the added material showing over-the-top violence, such as an eyeball being hollowed out of the socket, a scalping and even a person's head being torn off. There are also several graphical insert devices that, however, give rise to a goof: while it is clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask to the patient's face! <br /> <br /> The film is also claimed to be a loose remake of Cardona's own black and white horror movie DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but since I haven't seen it, I can't say how much of it was actually pilfered for NAT BLOODY APES ...
