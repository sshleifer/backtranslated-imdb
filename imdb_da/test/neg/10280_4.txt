I've always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I have always been fascinated by the title, the star and the desert, but for some (now quite clear) reason, this movie is never shown on television, or I have to miss it if ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie rarely appears: That's because it's not that good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much a mess. <br /> <br /> ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first-time instructor and it shows. The movie is essentially a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing that holds it together. More like a collection of short films accompanied randomly. The movie can be boiled down to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; police going to work crazy guy telling the story; policeman finds dead body policeman and boss and boyfriend in the bar; hunting scene; etc. The scenes just don't flow together. They are very clearly independent of each other and because of this the characterization is weak, the border is amateurish. The scene in the bar with the girlfriend, the stage on the courtyard with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the boss shouting at each other was poorly worthy. I almost stopped the movie during these (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film. The style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. The intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. Then it tries to be a buddy movie (Big John and Zipper) saw a murder mystery; saw a melodramatic love story; etc. A movie doesn't have to have a particular style to be successful, but I'm afraid the style of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he went with it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateurish, the look is extremely (and deceptively) professional. The kinematics are amazing. Each frame is worth an exhibition at an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music industry, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful look of the film gives more conviction to the end product than it really deserves. And thanks to Robert Blake's play (of a very poorly written character), the film maintains some degree of realism, though nothing else makes sense. What is remarkable about the film's appearance and composition is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times over. Intro credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was made 13 years later. Scenes of Johnny's dress, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of American Gigolo. Strangely enough, the ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very modern feel to it because of its amazing images, even though history and philosophy behind it are hopelessly obsolete. So ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, a remarkably underestimated and overlooked movie because it has apparently influenced many future filmmakers out there when it comes to appearance and composition. Very few movies can claim to have achieved this and legendary filmmaker Conrad Hall should take full credit. But on the other hand, the EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, confusing history and confused direction, of which no one is worth remembering.
