This (very) low-cost movie is fun if you are a John Krasinski fan, but is otherwise disappointing. At least it was short, so I didn't feel I had wasted too much of my time. John's scenes are funny enough, but the attempt at "deep" scenes with Lacey Chabert is quite nauseating. It starts to look like it was a funny movie, but some of the characters are just as indistinct, while the others are too serious to just fall flat. Don't let me get started at the end. It was totally unlikely and didn't even fit the rest of the movie. I'd say I'm not bored, though, why I rated it over a three. Fans of John Krasinski will enjoy watching him with a bandana and stockings around his head and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and be sure to check out John's deleted scenes, they are better than some that were actually included in the movie.
