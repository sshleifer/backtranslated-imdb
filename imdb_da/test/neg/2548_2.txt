I rented The Matrix Revisited with one of my friends. We both loved The Matrix and we both love film making so we wanted to see what was happening behind the scenes in The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you almost nothing about the art of cinema or even how The Matrix was made. It is largely a great advertisement for The Matrix, a movie that the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the problems and the hassle and detail of making The Matrix, look no further than the bonus features of the original DVD in The Matrix. There are things they show in the documentaries that I hadn't even realized had to be done or made. The matrix was such a difficult and challenging movie that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that is about as informative and interesting as an MTV special.
