I felt as though the two hours I spent watching this movie might have been better served by maybe going to the local used bookstore and looking at old fashion magazines and Halston ads. Or maybe by looking at paint dry. These two recruits would at least have mistaken me a little more than "India Song". The most frustrating part of sitting through this was that I could see which moods / atmospheres were trying to be created, and the idea of ​​these could have been interesting if they had become more generous. Instead, there was a presentation of a disjointed, silly chain of nonevents - with the same scenes rehashed over and over again to strike some point in our senses. I loved spending more time on this movie by writing any kind of review, except to warn other people of this waste of time.
