In all episodes, I never saw any real action or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The reason is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Someone gets something old and then someone else tells them a little about it and how much it is worth and who has done it and where it comes from and how much it does could sell to and if there was any work for it. <br /> <br /> I saw 30 of these, I realized ... there's no drama .... no one loses a limb or a life or gets divorced or hit by a car or plane. <br /> <br /> There are no cargo or explosions - not even a horse carriage with old cars. <br /> <br /> All these weapons and swords, and no one goes on a violent killing ... what gives? No pshycos, no ax murderers, no guns, there are old Englishmen in bad suits ... just yap yap yap ... you have an old tea set and it came from Germany's country back in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. I am still waiting for someone with a time machine to go on the screen and ask about it, but no ... it will never be, and all that is happening is that some heavy Englishmen or woman earn a little laugh at something sold in Boston or China under the Ming Dynasty - great EFFIN agreement. Can't anyone ever kidnap one of the leaders and hold them for ransom? Are there no alien spacecraft that will wipe out the entire floor? Who in hell writes these things as a series and expects us to be awake? There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no excitement, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spear lasers from a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - More like take a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show ...
