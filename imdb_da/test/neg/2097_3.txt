Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. But for $ 5 in PathMark it was not total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario is related to a guy who is with this lady who is infected by a magic curse. The actors / actors are not names that are big (although some are similar to TV shows), so I don't want to do my usual Troy McClure stuff. <br /> <br /> For a while, the movie has your interest as the couple jumps a train and travels to LA to see a shaman to undo the curse. There are also some other plots going on; Like two ladies who smuggle drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total downturn. As fierce and shudder as the whole movie, the big finale is just completely computer animated. <br /> <br /> I saw the non-classified version that had tons of languages, gore, blood, violence, everything! The bonus features were OK. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: D-
