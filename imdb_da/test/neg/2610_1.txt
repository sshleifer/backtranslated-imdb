This son of a successor's son was horrible to say the least. You would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released, but Retro Puppet Master was not directed by or written by the original authors and contained poor history, lack of any emmontional connection to any sign and dragged slowly to scene scene. No building of strong plot, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie if you can sit through the whole wheel. I could never understand why a horror movie continues to make followers after the release of their "last chapter". I almost don't suggest seeing this flick, but if you have to, I wouldn't recommend doing anyone else sit through it with you.
