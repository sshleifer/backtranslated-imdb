This movie is just terribly horrible, the movie was just an hour long and in about 25 minutes of the movie was just useless random snowboard clips that didn't even link to the movie. The story is completely "resumed", my 5-year-old cousin could probably write a better script. I don't understand how anyone could fund the production of a movie like this ... horrible. This is definitely the craziest most horrible movie I've ever seen in my entire existence. I think the casting director just took some random children from the street to shop in this movie. Managing, acting, producing and writing for this movie are all really bad. I feel bad for the people who wasted money, financed this waste. You couldn't pay me to see this crap again.
