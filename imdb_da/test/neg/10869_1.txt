When a movie called Hell Ride comes out, you expect a certain amount of biker clich√©. With character names like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent" I braced me to the worst and was shocking in the face right by it. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooter are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes come down the road while "CC Rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leaders were just ridiculous and incredible. Seeing old men like the bishop and the madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men desperately trying to revive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best, but with such poor material it was lost. Even a look of Dennis Hopper in the full Easy Rider swing couldn't save it. And let's talk about the store that is being bought, should we? Many have compared this with Tarantino's work. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino work so brilliant, he knows it's over the top so he just goes out and takes it as far over the top as possible. The bishop took this film so seriously that it was no more than a bad copy of the exploitation genre.
