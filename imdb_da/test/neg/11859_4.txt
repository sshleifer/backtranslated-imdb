I'm going in this game and that's okay I guess. I was just expecting a little more. The main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions, you can't get it. The graphics are also not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards fall into the water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water, the guard will rise, but nothing happens. In my opinion, this is the worst of the three. I haven't played the first, but have played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double agent. This game deserves a 4/10 though. Could do with some improvements.
