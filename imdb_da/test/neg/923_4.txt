As a recent converter to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which led to my display of all season episodes, I expected more from Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie offering a slice of an average 'Joe's' life I need reasons to be interested in caring, feeling and believing. And along with Jeff Garlin at the helm, I also expected a host of shining comic moments. This movie failed me over and over again. Jeff plays with mother, plump sad bag, which is a social disaster. He hasn't had a relationship, really or even randomly, for many years. He seems to be mostly unemployed and, as mentioned, shacks with his mother dear. Can things get worse? Of course. In short order, he is fired by everyone around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All amplify his 'loser' status. Silverman's 'fat' experiment was so cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty" as a means of the salvation of his career also hits a great death. <br /> <br /> While the movie's last moments give a glimpse of better things to come to the cinematic journey, 'but with occasional golden glitters unfortunately lacked.
