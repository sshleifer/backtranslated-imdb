The prey has an interesting story, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June 1984, you may have caught it on the movie channel back in summer 85, but a little bit else is remembered. The reason is your basic killer in the forest again. But ironically, this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The city was actually shot once in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week on some drives ins, (yes Jim's name drive in showed this in June 84). But it has a dated look to it. Maybe they later liberated it to redeem them on all the other terrorist films the market was flooded with in 1984. Now in history, it has some sort of history, a forest fire back in the 1940s leaving many gypsies to death. But one of their children survives (our monster) then flash forward to today's day, which would be 1978, we have an older medieval couple camping only to be shipped by Monster. The roof line for this image claims that it is not human and its got an axis, but an axis was only used in those first two killings. Now we have a lot of teenagers that look like them in their mid 20s camping. We all know they are Prey, and the monster knocks them off one by one. For an 80 minute movie, it seems longer. We also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill cavities in 80 min. Overall, to be out in an 80's horror movie it seems to be more 70's than ever. Hey Prey had the potential to be a good scary killer in the forest movie, but falls a little short. However, it has a beautifully scary, cold look at the end and we have to wait for the last 2 minutes to see him. Side note, the monster has passed on to the star of the Addams family movie in the 1990s.
