The film's premise was very promising - kind of a gay Napoleon Dynamite-type movie. And to be fair, there were some fun moments and fun lines, but it wasn't really good overall. The script and dialogue felt like a local sketch production, full of predictable clich√©s and scenes. <br /> <br /> There was, however, fun that I got stuck to see how it was finished, as there were hints that something special is happening at the end. But it seems that either the film runs out of money or the author runs out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt and almost jumps directly from what seemed to be the main conflict in the movie for the final credits. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing but not completely unpacked ...
