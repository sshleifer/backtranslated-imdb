Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies all the time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this is just a big waste of time. Horrible, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night, and that was all I could do to finish watching. I understood that this weird crazy man wanted to catch Bigfoot, but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. It had some entertaining parts. It was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for too long in movies. I think the director is trying to fill the time. The worst thing was the way Bigfoot looked. The obvious man in a dress looked like a pink faux fur Bigfoot. It was ridiculous. If you want to see a very bad Bigfoot movie then I suggest you buy this movie. Personally, I wasted my time and money on this!
