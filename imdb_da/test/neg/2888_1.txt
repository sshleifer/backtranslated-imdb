This flick is worse than awful! It took a good story plot and turned into a schizophrenic cinema. The photography is extremely amateurish. . . resembles a 5th degree home profile project filmed with functional 8mm kiddie cameras. . . Editing seems to have been done by someone who has psychotic flashbacks (while on medicine and alcohol), with scenes cut short, followed by other independent scenes, then chopped segments of scenes inserted in. . completely unnecessary and free naked. . . missing scenes. . . daytime shifts inexplicably to night scenes, then suddenly back to daytime. . . obviously no continuity. The good acting skills of Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason are wasted, as the talents of the "key" support - (forget the villain and the Anderson women - very amateur actors). This film is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. . . Just get it professionally done this time.
