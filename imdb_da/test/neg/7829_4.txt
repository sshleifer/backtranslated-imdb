Olivier Assayas' movie stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who has financial problems. In desperation, he will sell his share of a company to a company called Golden Eagle, a company from the Far East. As Madsen begins his movements away from his company, Asia Argento comes back to his life. The couple had a hard love affair that included her doing business favor for Madsen (with the golden eagle). Once Argento has entered the film, the film follows her as we see the interwoven web, she is woven and how the complications jump dangerously and violently out of control. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. In fact, I was quite boring when the movie seems to go from pillar to post too much of the first hour, wondering what was other than giving a flabby role to Argento. Argento, daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in itself, is a unique actress. Sometimes amazingly good, she is more often than not giving you a quirky off beat depiction of a damaged person. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work. I don't think it works right here, mostly because the script is too "complicated" to support it. I didn't care what was going on, so her wounded girl rubbed me only the wrong way (she seemed more distressed than anything else). I don't blame the actors, but writer / director Assayas who once again made a complicated story with the kind of actors who love to tackle, but who leaves the audience to scratch their heads because they don't really work. <br /> <br /> If you are going to try it on cable
