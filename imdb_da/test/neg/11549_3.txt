Admittedly, I have thought of this in the hope of seeing some beefcake shots by James Brolin. Unfortunately, there was only one early, and the rest of the film was very tame and ultimately low sense. The story, which is centered on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage for many years begins to become obsolete. Nick, a successful businessman, is focused on the work of neglecting Julie, who tries to fill the gap by going back to school. Julia's longing for the passion she and Nick had early in their marriage begins to take the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for minutes at a time, causing her to do things like burning breakfast and leaving her husband's papers . At first she fantasizes about her husband, but when the film progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men and about meetings with random strangers she meets. This culminates in her actions with her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> This could have been an interesting prerequisite, but the performance is so bland that you wonder why they were bothering themselves. Characters are not developed. Subjects are not explained. Background information is not provided. It is not explored how Julie came to the point where she could not control herself and no explanation is given as to how she will do so in the future. The end product is a confused mess that is as confusing as Julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The action is a mixed bag. Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material she gets, even though her ongoing self-pity gets tough after a while. James Brolin seems to be reading his lines from cue cards, and even his anger over his wife's adultery is hard to buy in, he shows so little passion for the whole thing. The supporting roles are mostly forgettable. <br /> <br /> Disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story. More is a shame as it doesn't even offer the eye candy it promised.
