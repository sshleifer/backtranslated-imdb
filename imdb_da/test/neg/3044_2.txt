It's pretty much anything I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the Carol Kane vehicle in 1979. Camilla Belle is not much of an actress and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous telephone caller. <br /> <br /> But if you are looking for some good home architecture and decor ideas, this movie gives more inspiration than anything you want to see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes walking through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she provides sitting and searching for the origin of strange sounds and things that continue to "bump" at night. As she lurks around corners and comrades at a time, we come to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and her drains resembling Roman baths, a large kitchen with incredible backlit glass columns and the piece of resistance, an independent afiary and coy lady who has a self-watering system. Because the movie is not convincing enough to draw us into Jill's fear, we are distracted by the greatness of the house, which is not something you should do when you see a thriller. Even when Jill is pursued by the faceless madman, we curl because she breaks valuables and crushes up the coy pond, not because she is being murdered. <br /> <br /> The movie plods together as predictable as most teen slasher movies, and the end is anything but original. When it was over, I just wanted to find out where the house was and if it was right. Forget about Jill and the kids she was a kid. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
