May contain coils. For the past four years, I have been an avid fan of Ali G. Sacha. Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy, and in my opinion his best creation is Borat, who is as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. I did not disturb paying money to see this in the cinema; I suppose I didn't expect much, but when I rented the DVD recently, I found it pretty sad. The best part of Ali took mickey out of others was largely missed, and the manuscript was a plot that was pretty damn horrible; connects all car batteries together to blow a safe - really !! ?? <br /> <br /> This movie shows that I think some things can run too long and definitely not translate into the big screen. The movie also had the syrupy sweet end that I expected from British movies. Where have all the good British movies made ideals gone? That said, there were the odd very fun moments like the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM Q with "Shaven Haven - RESPECT" note. So in short I am an Ali G and Borat fan and I have had many of his interviews (especially the one with Anita Roddick from Body Shop), but this film fell really flat with me. If there is to be another movie, I hope this is a lot better than this lot of old tripe. <br /> <br /> Weasel100 Canberra, Australia
