A feminist channel where, if you look at: i) wild animal will rarely be emptied by singing, but instead attacking, killing and eating (the line that the grizzles never attack unless provoked was a hoot - unless "provoked" "means it looks meat); ii) homosexuality is both immoral in itself - and its acceptance is almost always connected through history with signs of society's dissolution and decay iii) few women are bisexual (in this is almost every woman presented as no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is far worse than adultery v) land there are for people to use, develop and enjoy we) it is like a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is on the son vii) a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii) parents' idolization of valuable ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior, regardless of their age and duty to engage in this most intimate and rewarding action only within it Most Intimate and Open Victim of Relationships: Marriage - Believe Me, You Won't Like This Movie! In essence, it's a Howard Stern kind of guy brought down by a Jane Fonda kind of woman (think The Electric Rider). These are ugly things because the values, ideals of the manuscript are so harmful. I share the other objections about the odd things in the writing: a) why would this man lose every boyfriend he has - because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral made him fail to keep dates with them? It's a mystery why he just says "it was personal" when exposed to anger and disappointed women. HUH? <br /> <br /> b) There is a huge disagreement (ie the scriptwriter wants it both ways) by telling us that the protagonist's mother loved the father with everything she had - and later we are told that was only a great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend. c) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. We are never told that the executor has the right to live on the property - only to determine the time of the sole heir's title and right to occupy the property. Still, the film shows that the executor is the rightful resident - which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor of a will that uses decedent's property before the conquest of will is fulfilled - it doesn't happen). <br /> <br /> d) The assumption throughout this movie is that women are just drawn to men and women - it's just absurd. Thus, we are told: i) that the character of Penelope Ann Miller is dating other men near the end of the film - after having been decedent for five years - and before it in a satisfactory relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after being married all his adult life to his kind man - is now dating another woman iii) the one girlfriend who is concerned about the protagonist now now "likes to try a woman". <br /> <br /> iv) A male transsexual is eager to be the protagonist v) that Mary Kay Place character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back" she says with an idiotic triumphal flip). <br /> <br /> It's all just ridiculous. I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a movie of a person who truly despises the traditional heroism of any man, hates the notion that a man needs to raise a child, detest the idea that there is a necessary relationship between marriage and sex. The film is preaching - and the kind of propaganda of false messages is not good.
