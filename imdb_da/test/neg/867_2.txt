Mother begins at night in the middle of nothing, on what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pickup truck pulls up and an angry father knocks out her alarm daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves her there, but she is not alone as the shady figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) sees her in a short distance. Virginia tries to make a conversation, but as she slips a cigarette under her Leopard print, high-heeled boots Nestor puts her at her neck and pulls her out into the dark. Nestor then rips her upper open, turns into a monster and begins to eat her interior. Virginia is the last victim of a serial killer who has Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) & LAPD confused, or at least it is the message that a local television news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) tells his viewers. Clay lives with her pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and therefore his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has an extra room which she decides to rent to the 'blind' dark sunglasses wearing Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily, she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses, revealing that he has strange colored eyes, and Nestor then becomes a monster again and bites Emily to transform her into a carnivorous monster like him. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, finds a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint), kills him and eats his gut, but Emily's son Clay has experienced it all and he has to choose between doing what is right and his love to his mother there is now just a grotesque blood-sucking and carnivorous monster! Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty horrible movie. Look at some of the other comments on the IMDb & genre listing it has got it seems that many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror. Now I can tell you now that I didn't see any comic elements in mother at all because there is no one unless they are very subtle. The only thing I can assume is that people see comedy in the current situation that mother presents, being an old lady who becomes a carnivorous monster and the predictable problems and emotional anxiety it causes for her son who find out. There are no jokes (except to mention a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humor or something even extremely fun in the movie itself & as far as I could see it is playing right through it's 90 minute run time. So, since there is no comedy in the mother, it must mean that there is a lot of horror right? Wrong, mother sucks & is painfully slow to look especially after the first thirty odd minutes consisting of Nestor, who turns into a monster a few times, bites Emily and shows her how to look for food and Clay find out. Until that time, mother moved at a pretty decent pace, some had some special makeup effects and had me interested, mum unfortunately runs another hour, basically the emotional villain Emily's son suffers, the final breakdown of his marriage and him being torn between love for her mother and the fact that she is a carnivorous monster. This part of the movie is incredibly slow, dull and just as dull as the dish, although it is nervous to resort to a clich√©d roll reversal scenario where Clay tells her mother to go to her room and stay there and lock the door behind her and tell her & put pillars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mother's script completely ignores the origin of the monster and asks us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how stupid an explanation might have been, I think some background to the monster would have helped. Technically, mother is gentle and inexpensive appearance, although I can't say it is badly done it's very average thing all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or something that I could make fun of passing the time on. The special make-up effect on the monster is OK, but they are used in very fast flashes, flashes and you will miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video-box artwork that I was, the monster is only in it three times maximum and all of them are within the pace of the first thirty minutes. There is not much to do either, a cut off arm, any short intestinal training, a burned body and an exercise in a person's arm is all we get. The play is OK, but please Mr Brion James, what is the risky accent! At least James had the good sense of knowing that he was in shame and sensibly chosen to be killed early in the case, everyone else is nobodies expecting the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985), but you must recognize him from Die Hard 2 (1990), did he Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! All in all, there is nothing that I can really recommend to Mother as a horror movie, and it certainly isn't a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor, very disappointing and once again I have made myself see a beautiful video-box artwork with lots of still pictures of cool great monsters. Absolutely one to avoid.
