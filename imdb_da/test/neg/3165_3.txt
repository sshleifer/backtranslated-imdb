This love story between an American journalist and a Eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict, as she is largely westernized (having studied in London) or some fireworks since she behaves quite limited. What little interest the story manages to raise is further down by their tree dialogues. They should be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but speak as if the words are put in their mouths by a Hollywood hack that is not much of itself. The movie also suffers from a fantastic lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in crowded little Hong Kong, overrun by a million Chinese refugees? And a presumably American journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally, the "song". Having heard it estimated 20 times throughout the movie, starting with the credits, it tends to lose some of its emotional effects, sorry to say.
