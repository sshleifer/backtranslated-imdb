I knew it would be horrible, but not so terrible !! since it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, there's nothing wrong with it! All the characters are boring, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring!, Plus the end is especially lamb! The only reason I rented this lap because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, but he's wasted here and looks very bored and shows no feelings what ever! Plus I cheered loudly when the movie was over! It's as if the movie had no plot, and it wasn't about anything, and Ice-T is godly (even though he's okay in some things), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar had no chemistry at all. There is a scene that the director tried to do emotionally, but he doesn't fail because Yvette Nipar doesn't really show all that many emotions, but there is a decent cargo scene, but it's not enough for me to recommend this god horrible movie! , plus the dialogue is horrible. Avoid this movie like the plague not a terrible thing, please avoid and trust me on this, you can thank me for the words. The direction is horrible! Fred Olen Ray does a horrible job here with sharp camera work, ridiculously cheap to watch pieces, horrible angles, ridiculous use of stock footage and keep the movie at an incredibly boring pace. That act is horrible! Michael Dudikoff is not far from his usual fantastic self, he looks very bored and shows no feelings, what ever is, his character is also extremely boring, as I cannot believe he logs on for this waste he had nor any chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still rules !!!). Ice-T hardly has anything to do and also bored, and he didn't convince me a bit. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he had something of a wimpy character, I didn't like him. Yvette Nipar is beautiful, but was really horrible here, she didn't show much emotion, and had no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result, I didn't care for her character! Art Hindle, (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh), and the rest of the cast are also bad. Overall avoid like the plague! Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw were ashamed of themselves! BOMB out of 5
