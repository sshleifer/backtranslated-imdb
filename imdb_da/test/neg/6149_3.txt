But then again, what ever is? I picked this up at my local 99cent store, for you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). I remember watching this video as a teenager and thought it was a cool flick. Too bad the movie and my memories do not match. Regardless, it's not a terrible way to blow a couple of hours and it's nice to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... Man, oh man, I can't think of anything else to say about this flick ... (Just fill the room to meet the ten line rule ... ) Good golly, this is pathetic, just how bad is this movie that the best thing I could do with it was five frickinlines of text? So anyway, ten lines of text, eh? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember throwing a movie you've just seen.
