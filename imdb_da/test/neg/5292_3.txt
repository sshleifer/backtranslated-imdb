I enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time I saw it when I was 9. Dunderclumpen is a little sweet for kiddies in a corny way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturday morning, Swedish cases make it easy on the eyes. Do not expect older children to be interested, as live action / animation is far behind time and most older children will be bored. This is definitely a under 10-year film and a lovely part of memories for those who were young children in 1974.
