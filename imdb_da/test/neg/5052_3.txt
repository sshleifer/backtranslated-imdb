You know I get really tired of all the generic music used in this type of movie (see Jawbreaker, Disruptive behavior, etc.). Every scene with real excitement here (and there are some) is immediately subjected to a cheesy pop melody that dilutes the tension completely. Why do they do this? To sell some soundtracks, of course, but in this case mission is unfulfilled - did anyone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Mrs. Mirren attacks her role with joy and joy (with some cheez-wiz to add kicks). But what does Molly, Leslie and Vivica do here? Their roles (they are so under-utilized that I can't use "characters" here) have no purpose in history, so I can't figure out why three well-known actresses had been thrown. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the end is so incredibly hackneyed and irresponsible. The children come out of scot-free and seem like nothing happened - everyone smiles at the exam. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, attack, class manipulation) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Little things too - was Tingle's story about her husband true? What is armbue? Would the virgin Katie character loosen her cherry on a whim so? (Great message, guys.) Why did McKean go to her home? How did Kate's academic nemesis go through the door at the exact moment? How do students even get the teachers' home addresses? WHAT IS WITH JEFFREY TAMBOR ?? On what basis did McKean come across Tingle? She is the blood, mistreated and held hostage by the students, and that's enough! <br /> <br /> Oh, I spend a lot more thought on the script than Mr. Williamson apparently did, so I stop here. br /> <br /> 3/10
