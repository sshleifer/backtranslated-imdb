The reason is simple: an American couple is on holiday in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the almighty Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the vampire's great boss. This is OK until now. The girl's partner is back to look for her. And now horror begins. He comes on a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they only drank animal blood). These vampires are in conflict with the bad guy for about 800 years. But using the 'good vampires', the guy begins to seek his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now, the battle scenes begin, which karate movie without a fight? Another thing I noticed is that the vampires are very ugly guys. I mean .... a vampire is an old-fashioned guy (he's alive since ... forever) he has style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie the vampires are .... strange. As if they were cycling, they were all dressed in leather and they were destroying everything in their path. The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie is low budget. The script is boring and the actors are not too skilled. The music is pretty good, but the effects are not that great. To summarize the movie it is not so good, but if you have a free afternoon, see it and tell me if I am right or not.
