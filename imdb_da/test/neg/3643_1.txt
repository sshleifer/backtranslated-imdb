This is the worst show in Nickelodeon's history. First of all, no boarding school has a Sushi Bar, flat screen TV and gives each student a laptop. This makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The grounds are pointless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad, it makes me take my own life. I really hate that Zoey in the show is the most popular girl in school and the most beautiful and smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never has any real problems, and every guy wants her. She is so perfect. There is no such thing. I also hate that everyone would do something for her and everyone chooses her for each team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so uncomfortable. Her experiments are pathetic, meaningless and false. Chase is such a glimpse. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her it would ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael is trying to be fun, but he never achieves anything. Nichole is so perky and screams a lot. She is never seen any work or study, but she is a straight One student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she sucks (excuse my language). Should I say more? I think no. For your own sake, stay away from this show at all costs.
