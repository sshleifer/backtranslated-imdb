Last week on Friday I went to see "Snakes on a Plane" with my friends. It was fantastic compared to this horrible movie (though many of the scenes were ridiculously fun). Basically, a woman has a Mayan curse where she snaps up harmless innocuous snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl into their victims. The girl with the bag of cola is pretty hot. The title screen says "100 passengers ... 3,000 Venemous Vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Only a few stoners and some others washed out losers. It's worth the five bucks to see the woman become a big CG snake and devour the whole train and then suck into a big whirlpool though. It's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap movie just to make a few bucks because of "Snakes on a Plane" craze.
