Not sure if this is just a miserable movie or if it was supposed to be a "B" Western. History line was so-so, but the movie, editing and acting were just bad. Plus the music in the background was annoying to no end, too loud and just non-stop. Many times you could not make the background music dialog box. I am in the SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and do some Old West shooting with them and many of the actors are members of this group so I bought it. If you have no interest in this group of people or the sport, you will certainly not even have that little bit of interest in helping the movie. The act of even the veteran actors (especially Stella Stevens) also left much to be desired.
