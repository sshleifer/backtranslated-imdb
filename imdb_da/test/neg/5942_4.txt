This movie captures the short moments between a mother and a son in rural Russia as she is dying. <br /> <br /> I'm so torn between being nice to the movie or declaring it a test of patience. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialogue capturing the essence of their emotions. There is really nothing to say because everything that has to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love for one's family. It also reminds me that I could be in such a situation, though in a comfortable place, to look after a very ill person. "Food In Vision" is cruel reality. On the other hand, "Food In Sight" really moves too slowly. Should I really see a train past the horizon for over a minute? With my previous experience with "Telets" and "Aleksandra" I am so tempted to put "Food In Synth" among them as a total bore. I think one should be in the right state of mind to appreciate this movie. I probably see the beauty of it, but maybe I'm not in the right state of mind.
