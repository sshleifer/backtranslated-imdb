Decent but overstated dramatic thriller, movies are trying to portray the budding out-of-control inner demons of a troubled artist. The problem is that a single relationship illustrated on the screen is trustworthy, and plausibility seems to have been thrown out of the window. The title character is so difficult to relate to that it is quite impossible to imagine any of the screen characters that are emotionally invested in him either. The conclusion is also quite predictable; There are certainly enough traces that follow to go to indicate exactly where the story is going. If one chooses to completely suspend his belief in situations or relationships, the film itself is well acted (especially by the leaders) and manages to create some fine tensions that history unfolds. As a metaphorical feature, there is something to think about, and if the manuscript was stronger, there is certainly potential here that could have been better utilized.
