I never really started to watch the show before it was canceled and started showing re-runs. I actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. When I saw the fourth and fifth one, I began to become irate. The first problem was that they made the irrelevant scenario of history that repeated itself (Jr. had a child like his parents did). The other had to be the one where they all had mated with someone (eg: Katie and Franklin). The third was when they made Jr more idiotic than before, which started to be boring and exciting to the point where I wanted to go into T.V. and put the stupidity out of him until he is unconscious. The fourth had to be the zealous dork that Clarie claimed as a girlfriend. The fifth had to be Katie, she began to be good to herself and was treated to her "boyfriend" Franklin as the pushover he was. Last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like seeing a horrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson only more annoying !!! They jumped seriously at the shark when he came to the show. There was little to no realism for his character, and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force that showed Noah could not act. Eveytime I saw that the baby just made me relax he stupid. But B.F. (before frank) this was fun fun and very entertaining.
