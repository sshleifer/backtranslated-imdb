"I remember waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "Vision Quest that was the American West." <br /> <br /> "We went to a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo" <br /> <br / > "... the place is haunted ..." <br /> <br /> "I think there's another dimension right here." <br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband Many decades ago, the hustle and bustle and culture of New York left and moved to a God-forsaken city with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There they renovated a theater - painting it is a very home-spun / folk art way. And when she is finished, she starts to make dancing performances for virtually none. In many ways, it reminds us of the Werner Herzog movie FITZCARRALDO or DREAM AREA - although AMARGOSA is a documentary for a real person - not a mythical crazy man like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband eventually leaves - much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose. So today she lives with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros in the end with her new male company, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think of this documentary depends on your prospects. If you are into New Age ideas and open to those senses then you will probably appreciate the movie. Her talk of how she remembers her birth, ghosts, vision quests and psychics sincerely made psychology teacher in me cringe and this would certainly be the case for many people. In addition, her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers, but with my background in environmental problems and biology, I see burros and horses as a blush that would destroy native plants and animals . So in two different accounts I tend to think the opposite of Marta - which is more of a "feel" and "sensing" individual. Depending on how you feel about all of this will definitely color your opinions - and I'm pretty sure most people either think she's a genius or a nut! You just have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Now, after all, the movie is interesting, and Martha's life is definitely not boring - especially since recent years, people have actually begun to take trips to the desert to see her perform. There is a clear consequence for her and her unusual little world. While I wouldn't be nearly as positive as most reviews, I can't be as negative as one review as there's a clear profit for this odd documentary. I like movies about unusual people, and Marta is certainly unusual! I also appreciate her love for her art and happy life - it is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology at an art school and it would certainly be interesting to show this to the staff - where I am absolutely sure we would have a strong positive and negative reaction to the movie - probably depending on of whether the teachers learned the art class or the core plan! That would certainly be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but since Marta's husband had affairs with whom has this happened? After all, they lived in the middle of no one and I was left wondering where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see her perform and / or stay with her hotel, it can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The site is in English, French and German, and hotel prices are quite reasonable, as are the ticket prices.
