Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricate the plot, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ends. This adaptation had none of it. <br /> <br /> So much of what was amazing in the book (Monken's story and the betrayed agents, the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) was completely lacking in this adaptation. Instead, there is this brand new plot of bio-weapons that was a gobler. Forsyth's main characters always operated in the shadows, always just above the reach of the antagonists. The joy of his books has always been the desire to carry out their mission. Swayze's Monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck and said, "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he called himself during the day. the movie. And with all the attention, the amount of time it took the evil ones to grab him was surprising. <br /> <br /> There was some energy on this movie, so I give it a "3" instead of a "1". It was also great to see some underused benefits like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope someday will once again be entitled to a Forsyth movie adaptation as "Day of Jackal" did.
