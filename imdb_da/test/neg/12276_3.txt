Mild spoilers underneath. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was evident on the horizon when the TFW was filmed. From the European refugee opening scene to the final prediction that Nazism will be millions of Germans' death, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertainment value here, although the dust bowl recordings are interesting to us who are not old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with Mr. Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and the daughter assimilates to America with Wayne's help. Aside from the dust bowl scene, the only memorable aspect of the film is a best viewed with inspection. Coburn's speech compares Nazism with a malignancy that is worse than cancer and describes the (then current) successes as an immediate outbreak of energy from a patient just prior to death, was miserable accurate, and Varno's Dr. Scherer played exactly to the postwar war recordings of unwarranted Nazis directing their actions. <br /> <br /> Looking from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at entertainment outside the WWII perspective, you have to say that this is one of Wayne's less successful bets.
