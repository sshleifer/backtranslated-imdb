After wasting 2 hours in my life on this movie on sennat tv, I went back and read some of the IMDb material to remind me why I saw it in the first place. Eventually, the only thing I can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me. But this movie was a total waste of effort. It fails at all levels, and to see that it is described on IMDb as a comedy, I leave real loss. I can't remember more than a few chuckles. There are more laughs in every episode of law and order than in the last man. Seriously. Too much of the character's interaction did not seem to have any foundation and was therefore very unlikely / incredible. <br /> <br /> If it hadn't been for the almost free bikini shots, well, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or lose it and just fast forward to bikini shots. Don't spend another $ 1 to rent it yourself.
