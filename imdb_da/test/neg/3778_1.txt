For the last 5 years I have rented some bad movies ... all on purpose. See, I strive to be a film auditor, and as we all know, horrible movies are released every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented this one. I saw it all the way through ... and shouting loudly. This is one of those movies that is so freakin bad, it makes you throw. It actually has a sick feeling in my stomach. I've seen lots of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?), But this one takes the cake. The reason was hard to follow, the lighting awful and the sound almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here, this movie would be on -11 for me. This may seem odd, but I highly recommend it. It's something you need to see for yourself ... but don't tell me I'm not warning you. I don't think this review could be more accurate, so I'm done now. <br /> <br />
