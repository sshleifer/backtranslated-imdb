As a retired USAF MSG (flight maint. spec), this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The fact that a teenager could ever get on the plane line, much less get into an F-16 is ridiculous. The military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world, and this movie makes air force and all its members seem stupid at best. Yes, I know this is just a movie, but it does convey a message to the younger people that we are all idiots and believe me, we are not. Logistics involved in establishing any kind of mission is very much involved, even in the 1980s, military computers were too safe to hack any teenager, and the other flaws in this movie make Peter Pan more credible. Sorry, for me, this movie has no entertainment value at all.
