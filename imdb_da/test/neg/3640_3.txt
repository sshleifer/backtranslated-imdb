This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's see, Zoey is perfect; She is boring, gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she is popular, she goes to a fantastic school with amazing rooms. Reasons why I gave this show a 3: 1 action is horrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these countless actresses (especially Victoria Justice) on television. 2. The signs are incredible and inconsistent. You have your typical popular girl. A peppy, shallow, stupid, stereotypical girl portrayed by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical jock guy who is something normal and actually lovely. So the stereotypically smart girl who is a freak and of course does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of her. Then a firm and beautiful beautiful boy who would be happier and gazing into a mirror all day. Then one will be an actress who is played by another smelly actress. And last a normal nerd person guy. 3. The ground is dull and lame. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. Can't they just be normal! 5. Everything is perfect for them, and we are all reminded of how much our lives stink.
