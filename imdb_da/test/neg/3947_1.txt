I tried. God knows I was trying to like this Swiss cheese in a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big enough to drive a carriage. The overall action was similar, and the characters enough to regret that they died as recently spraying roaches and spreading to die their own gruesome deaths. Overall, however, it was not very scary. Then we have seen spooky quickly moving characters in the background since "The Brood" why back when / and it was scary so just short. This movie has never solved the basic plot points and that is the author's job. Of course, you expect the director to pick up the fact that history didn't make sense. Like who was the secret room behind the wardrobe, why did blood-dead ghost not die when she got the nails as prescribed in the book they read earlier? Why did the computer say "game over" for Frankie's character, even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I don't feel so comfortable recommending this movie as it makes you feel like you were wasting your time and there wasn't enough payout in really scary moments.
