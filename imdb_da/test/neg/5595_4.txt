1. Watched 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J. Cardone): Sexual political thriller who doesn't really succeed in any of these areas, very well, but early on there are some interesting soft core scenes. The movie starts by depicting a couple exploring their sexual fantasies in the midst of their work environments or where and what suits their fancy. The couple take an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman who is willing to be part of a three-person and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point, we only know that this couple is well away, but we do not know before returning that the fiance is part of a wealthy political family. The man hopes to be on the way to the point of possibly getting a congressional place after the marriage. Then they receive a packet in the mail from an anonymous source of explicit pictures of their meeting in the bathhouse, and their qwest begins with how and why they were filmed, who sent the package what they want and how they can clear their names before anything of This is coming out. This qwest becomes an obsession that takes them deeper into the seedier worlds and takes much of their time to the point where their friends and family wonder what they are doing all day and why they are constantly looking down. This movie is interesting at times, but it makes for ridicule as they personally seek the problem, instead of getting the police involved early because of their pride. This error obviously keeps the movie going. The performances are fine in spite of the non-named, but the situation is clear, and the film begins to become about half the way through. And of course they throw in a twist at the end, which challenges and challenges everything that happened earlier (which is the norm these days when they don't know what to do to spice up the movie). However, this does not help this movie a bit.
