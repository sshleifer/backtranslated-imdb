Being a Harrison Ford fan is probably enough to be friendly. It was predictable, sappy ... my husband made a lot of gagging sounds while we saw it. What a disappointing movie. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars !!! Hard to believe the reviewer saw the same movie we did.
