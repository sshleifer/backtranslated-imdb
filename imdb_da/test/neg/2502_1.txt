Joe D'Amato could have made some other remarkable films in his very long and highly productive career-productive, of course, by making very cheap Z-grade movies in Italy's huge exploitation boom from the late 70s early 70s, but Porn Holocaust is not one of them, or at least it should not be. Permitted, I should not expect much of a movie with such a title, but I thought contemplating the back of the box's description that it could have some funny horror scenes with "horny, mutant, cannibal zombie". It turns out that the zombie does not appear more than halfway in the film, and in each turn we get a hesitant sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine. It is fine. But it's not that fun, except in most "what f *** is this BS" kind of. There is a ridiculous dialogue involving lobsters that cost more from mail order Japan than in Paris. Hot, slender women play biologists and zoologists who have special sexual hangings (let the door be unlocked to be raped and a bi-polar form of enjoyment. It goes all the way to the island where the "main attraction" is a guy in already using a completely pathetic (forget the ridiculous) time, just staring at novices to the radioactive wasteland of the Scottish on the island, once revealed a face as one of the guards in the Jabbas palace and have a sweet potato for a main genital But much more stupid than anything before it is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has a redundant time to escape, but just sits there, with a shiny face, as the monster brings gifts and what should be a racially motivated exploitation movement by the filmmakers, only the cattle are killing and killing the white women, and not her, and of course it ends with a "happy" end, I use quotes, of course, of a kind shock tte could have any kind of legitimate conclusion at all. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, that's not what you might expect, possibly a bloody horror movie with lots of sticky but chilling Italian monster zombies that devour human flesh. If something is what the violence in the movie is on a shoe string; a log-hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody recess that is followed by a tomato that hits someone. So, really, the last part of the title is meant more for the sake of the market. But even as a porn movie it has a little to go on, except as a reason to throw and the crew get a paid vacation to the Caribbean (as an interview with George Eastman suggests, this was only a few quick things that were done on island ). It has penny-bought sklocky camera work and similar actors, full of genitals about 3/4 of all the time and with miserable lip sync and music like Nino Rota, who is forced to gun-point to do some snappy in a bordello, and it's a piece of celluloid fertilizer all the same; All of this could be a huge guilty pleasure, but it is not.
