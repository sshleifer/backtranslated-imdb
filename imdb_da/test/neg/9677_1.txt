How this movie could be classified as drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would try to delete this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses were reported to Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew Lot, appears thousands of years before he was born. Canaanites walked the earth ... really? What did you think of scriptwriters? Was it just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that from Sunday School") or attempted to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible - from Christians, Jews and Muslims to historians, Archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... have there actually been any insults? Anyone who had a taste model would have won on this!
