The brave is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city, she grew up in love and love. She has her fiance David (Naveen Andrews) whom she plans to marry. But one night, while Erica and David are out walking their dog, they are attacked and hit by a group of degenerates leaving David dead. Erica regains, but is heartbroken and traumatized later, and can hardly cope with real life anymore. She buys a gun from a guy on the street for protection. But one day she trades in a store and a man comes in and shoots the clerk's dead. It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a vigilante. Kill anyone trying to threaten or harm her or others. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) tracks this unpleasant unknown killer and becomes friends with Erica. Erica begins to regain her beauty as she kills these violent people, but is unsure of what she is doing is morally right. And as her and Mercer get closer, he doesn't even understand the unknown murderous attacker right next to him. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster performs very well in The Brave One. She portrays this kind of violent, morally corrupt character brilliantly. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry together and strengthen the film to a certain level. The brave looks visually untouched, and conveys some brilliant camera work, but it doesn't work for a great effect. The scenes where Erica is completely traumatized and afraid to leave her front door to see the world over. The camera swung back and forth to the sides in an almost dream-like way and really caught the moment with the essence. While almost every time Erica killed someone, everything just had to go and show her facial expressions in detail. Slo-mo was used correctly when Erica committed her first murder. But why continue to make this effect almost every time she committed murder? The camera's work creates a good mood for most of the movie, but there are a few scenes here that are just overkill. <br /> <br /> The Brave One is very much about how these murders affect Erica emotionally. Her fianc√© is killed by a group of bullies, and suddenly New York City's love turns to the head. She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and then she says on her radio program. However, I do not fully understand that. Erica seems to have never understood that violence can occur at night in the city, and that's pretty stupid. If she lived there all her life, she must be either blind or very ignorant. Erica also seems to be a glutton for inhuman, murderous people. She doesn't even have to look for them, they just have to come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong action. The courageous deal with morality and proper use of violence at the beginning, and then suddenly it glorifies it. The ending is very negative and completely immoral and inhuman. It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, which the film spends so much time trying to evolve, and suddenly his morality takes a U-turn. The moral of The Brave becomes very broken and just strikes the whole end. So violence is okay? It is a good thing to commit murder as long as it is revenge? I refuse much to believe in it. You know why? Because I have a conscience that this movie is probably missing. It's not right to kill another person, no matter how bad they are or how much you hate them. Erica Bain sets out to stop these evil people, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard give a lot of strength to this movie. The Brave contains a strong message, but that message is both immoral and wrong. This movie can look good, well-acted and intelligently strong. But it gets pretty mess at the end. I give the brave a 1.5 out of 4. The message is much out of line and morally wrong, and really can't be saved by the good actor.
