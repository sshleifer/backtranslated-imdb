I bought this at VHS as "Terror Hospital" and when I got home, I checked the IMDb and was like OMG, it's the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another one from Al Adamson who clearly had learned a little less about filmmaking since "Blood of Dracula's Castle" days. Where the previous effort is a more or less complete sclerotic lump, it blends it a little and adds a certain element of variation and surprise in the midst of incompetence. Safe half of the movie is a blind soccer player who breaks the breeze with his stacked nurse, but we can at any time cut away to the jabby disembodied head of the satanist mastermind, or nurse Sherri runs a farmer with a ramp or a little abstract student movies quickly cut to go with the pulsating blob effects in the possession scene, or the most liberal half-hearted topless piece ever, or god knows what else (I forget to be honest). As stupid pieces of step, this can run towards the high end. Congratulations, Al.
