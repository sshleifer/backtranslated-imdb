PLEASE?! If it's about technology and what you do to kill others and ourselves, I think I missed his whole point. Because I went out, I felt that Reggio was dependent on the Cold War recordings of space research and had nothing new to add to the technology fear dialogue. Trails of 1 and 0, which denote technology and mathematics and science - do it. Someone out there see The Matrix? And movement studies of people in motion? Have you ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses accurate clips of Muybridge's photographs of human motion studies. <br /> <br /> This movie was derived and the score is just enough to make Philip Glass sound like ALL he has made over the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie at all costs !!
