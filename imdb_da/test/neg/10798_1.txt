It was quickly destroyed by the poor quality acting, filmography, many senseless scenes and a horrible villain. Well, let's see that Joe Estevez is bad (as usual), but he's not the only casting problem, the writer Vivian Schilling is not a great actress, in fact, well she sucks. Her script is not that bad, it's just badly fixed. In fact, if the direction had been better, and if better actors had been cast, it could have been a really good movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with all these issues, "Soultaker" is not uniform by Passable as a horror movie, plus pacings are just awful as well. <br /> <br /> The MST crew had fun with this one, but it certainly wasn't one of their better efforts. 5 for that, nothing to the original.
