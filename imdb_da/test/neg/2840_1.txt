Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent who is in danger of being killed by a counterfeit madman who kills people in his profession, which he feels makes housing prices too high. As motives, it goes, it's pretty damn retarded. Lisa's girlfriend is a talk show host, which the killer continues to call on the air. At first I was positive, it was supposed to be a comedy or satire of some sort, but when the endless minutes drone over and over again, I realized that it was not, and the film was just grossly incompetent in every way, form and form. I am just surprised that something terrible was not led by Jeff Lieberman (yes, email me again to me, Jeff you hack) Anyway, back to the movie, poor, poor Barbeau, you can accurately determine when her movie career went down in flames and it all started here. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Movie Channel
