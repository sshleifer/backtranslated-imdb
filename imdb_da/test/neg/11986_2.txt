I really liked the Far Cry game, great graphics, good level design, interesting and clever enemies, above average length and even a somewhat decent plot. I'm not standard against movie spin-offs of games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was fun. But what Uwe Boll has done here is to take the game and modify all its good aspects and turn them into something terrible (well not the length, the movie only runs a merciful 90 min) The characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement . The whole plot is told without any terms or mysteries. Several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every single story. And came on "genetically modified soldiers"? they could have got a better name. <br /> <br /> But this movie was going to get a prize for the most idiotic love scene. I have never seen anything like that. I couldn't believe they were trying to be serious "we have to get out of the wet clothes" "I think I get hypothermia" (though everyone has T-shirts) "we have to cuddle for body warm" Is that yours pistol? "But ... but ... there weren't people who deliberately did this? There must have been a scriptwriter, an instructor, actors, a gaff, an electrician, some mad guy, why didn't anyone jump into that scene for To stop this evil? Was this movie made of ravaging, inhuman, genetically modified filmmakers? I don't want to start ranting about how many logical errors, inconsistencies, and scriptwriting errors were, but even to the die-hard action fan, this can be nothing but insulting. <br /> <br /> This movie actually asked to be rated 2 out of 10, so I want to do what favors, but it makes me explain where The other star comes from. Special effects? Nah. Acting? Not really. References to the game? You want. Wait! They used the font from the game for the title and the credits. It was nice. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a flick for a poorly filmed, go to "2012 - Supernova", this is just - sad.
