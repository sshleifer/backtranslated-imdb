The Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and gives me headaches. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask all movie schools, please teach future instructors how to keep the camera stable. Flailing the camera around as aunt Betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing. <br /> <br /> Also, movies are primarily a visual medium director may want to point their camera in the general direction of the action. Film also requires light for work. Maybe a light source should be used so that you can see the action on the screen. I know it's a hollow movie, but there's absolutely nothing scary about watching pitch in minutes at a time. For that matter, the movie on the head does not show signs of confusion on the screen, it indicates confusion in the edit box. <br /> <br /> One last comment to the director I'm sure there was a good reason to have a horrible fake CGI bonfire site. I honestly can't think of one for my life. <br /> <br /> Now on to the scriptwriter. Try to make at least one sign cheap. I prefer two or more, but a decent person I can fight for or break can help. Also if you want flashbacks make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you want a surprise ending, it's probably best if it doesn't conflict with every thing that comes before it. And try to add some fancy game tuning terms to a hollow movie. You may have wanted to start playing games. The cavern is a pretty bad movie, badly shot with a confusing, unlikely and anti-climatic ending.
