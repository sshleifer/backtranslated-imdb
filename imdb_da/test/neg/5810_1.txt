It's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so boring and boring little movie. The story is predictable when it is not completely ridiculous. It is all about "dutiful gesture", which, as presented here, bears absolutely no conviction. Yes, the MGM's "production values" are beautiful, and yes, Mrs Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of clich√©s on everything effective ... It is my opinion that this movie received bad reviews when it was originally released; The passage of time has not improved it.
