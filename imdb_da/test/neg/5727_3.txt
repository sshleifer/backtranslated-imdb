I reckon on the company that made this movie that people should think about the Conan movies, but unfortunately for those who made this, it just does it. You will think the man Conan movies was pretty cool ... this is totally boring and sucking. The story, who cares? It's not going to help you as this movie more or less, as it just seems like a really cheap movie. Arnold, doesn't look like he belongs to this one, why he agreed to play the role, lies beyond me. Now enough for the money. I just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is just plain and simply horrible.
