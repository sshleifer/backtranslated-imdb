Unfortunately, Koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very closely, apparently until the production company ran out of money. All the sets in the first half of the film were carefully restored by the book - something missing from many other Koontz films. Despite its other (numerous) downfalls, I continued to look in anticipation of some really beautiful scenery. Wrong. As the detectives appear on the crackhead's apartment (in the book), the film is without funds and one of the most exciting scenes from the book is destroyed. Where the book spread grisly discovery, a search and a hunt through the boys' apartment, the film offers the back seat of the tub. <br /> <br /> Let's see it - Koontz writes without a budget in mind because imagination is free. If a Koontz novel is ever made into a decent movie, nobody will go and see it because they have been slaughtered so many, many, many times before. Therefore, Dean Koontz Frankenstein is now just the Frankenstien - if you had seen your work slaughtered so many times, you would come out early if it seemed to happen again!
