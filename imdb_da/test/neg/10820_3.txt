The mission to watch the movie "The Cave" was a dream of one of my friends after experiencing the very dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a closet lurking in a cave, some young cave divers and not much else. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did. <br /> <br /> The immediate lure of a movie like this is the creature. What should he look like? Why does he live in a cave? How should this be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like Alien and Predator and Relic? The cave "demons" does not look far from the skeleton being in Alien: Resurrection and even has the sight of the Predator. Shame it is a total ripoff ... Let's look at the plot: Very confusing and jumping to more and more totally unlikely phrases, as a team of cave senters are sent to find a cave and its inhabitants in the Carpathians. The castings were very clear that we want young, hip, hard chickens, chiseled guys, and the girls who have brains must also be warm. We must also have one of all racial backgrounds, if the audience thinks that the filmmakers are prejudiced to a particular point of view. Completely done and I'm quite tired of it. The other main problem was the end, as if to say that there might be a successor. Plase shoots me if there is one. That mark on the end made me miserable. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points it received were more or less appreciative of the creator-builders for their high-quality jobs spent on costuming and designing for the monsters that live in even when they were completely skinned out. And there is an interesting (yet work) documentary on the DVD on underwater cave diving. Just check it out if you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before and it was better the first time.
