First, the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading. The film is about a group of girls downloading a misogynistic hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They stop at a little motel where he keeps them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence is followed. <br /> <br /> I chose this by mistake and thought it was the second 2007 movie "The Hitcher". Not that The Hitcher is any better, and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway, but it was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have thrown on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many movies I've seen with pretty much the same story, so this was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it terrible was a couple of scenes that ... well let me give an example. At one point, a door is covered by (what is quite obvious) blood and two police officers on the scene due to a 911 call looking at it from 30 meters away, seeing a man also covered in blood, going out of the door , agree that it looks suspicious but decides not to investigate further. <br /> <br /> However, it is ridiculous that the film was never boring, was well-produced, directed and acted, complete with good special effects, free naked and violence. I would not recommend spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to wear while cleaning my basement. Also highly recommended to fans of crummy movies, and would be a great movie to watch with friends when you plan to talk more than to watch.
