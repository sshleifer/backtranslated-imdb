Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey, who is transferring to an all-boy school during the first year that they integrate girls into it. The raw plot line is, I admit, a pretty good idea. Although this show was intended for children, a five-year-old could probably point out his fatal errors. First, Zoey is a clich√© character, her is super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there is nothing wrong with her; no girl is like that. It feels like the show was put in focus on Jamie Lynn Spears and increased her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just simple. But in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of all of them, which is sad to see that Dana is never beautiful. Nicole is too peppy and seems like a complete airhead, but gets mysterious straight A's. Lola seems to be able to trick something with her Emmy deserved action. Quinn must be super smart, and even though she is able to create the most unrealistic things, she is also made to be weird, and she never gets any guys, even though she is beautiful and smart, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole Get guys and they are all beauty and no personality. Chase and Michael are very similar, and I sometimes get confused. Logan is unrealistically rich and emits millions as if they were dollars. No one is so rich. I also noticed that all the characters on the show are significant to the Stacy girl who does nothing but do good to them. It is not fun! It is mediocre and it only affects young girls to shop for fine people. Finally, the school even adds the frost to the unreal cake by giving students 5-star facilities such as a scenic location, sushi bar, hot lounge with free soft drinks, pool and jacuzzi, movie theater and boys and girls' allowances to enter freely into the second sex dormitory. At most retirement schools, if a boy was to enter a girl's dormitory or vice versa, they would be expelled. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few years in the drafting process.
