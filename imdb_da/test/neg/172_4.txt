As noted in other comments here, the camera work is scary bad. I'm tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old, but it would be mediocre - to 7-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for an insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow perception of an intrigue in that world: the battle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries they want to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that would put the whole deal into the context so we are back with the selective process of the director and interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There is no shortage of despicable signs, or even despicable dogs, in sight. However, there is a lack of self-handling. <br /> <br /> Is the director a Marxist? I wondered that I was trying to maintain some sharp focus as the camera dipped, swerved, zoomed into a chaotic bloom. Small slabs in France: good. Huge growers in the United States: very, very bad. Forget hundreds of small vineyards throughout North America, Australia and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about the plot, it is better to read about it elsewhere. And you will be able to try your favorite wine without feeling ill while doing it. <br /> <br /> I suggest a new award in Cannes for Best America Bashing Diatribe.
