This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. period.this movie goes beyond ridiculous, it's like the director wants to get his ass case of the actors to mistakenly explain their roles as the amazing four, i think the movie should have been released in cartoon shops for the only thing to do Say it, desperate geeks who can't get enough cheesiness and want to see more and more crap movies. In conclusion to my paradox statements and dissertation, I think this film has had major drawbacks for the future of cast contributors, with the exception of jay underwood's character, where I think it was his best performance in roles as the non-human films in which history is told in a way he has no character. They cannot act and people have made good decisions not to watch their films. That is why he will most likely not be a major roles unless he sparks his career in a most rare but interesting way.
