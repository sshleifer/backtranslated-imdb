The weakest of the "old" crew Star Trek movies, this movie suffers from a terrible script and obvious budgetary constraints, especially in the abused finale. The bones of a good movie are here, and steering from Shatner is not as bad as it is commonly drafted, but the characters end up talking and acting out the style the previous 3 films had carefully established. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the dismissed Vulcan with bad and mysterious forces to influence humans, and these forces are responsible for some of the best scenes, especially for Deforest Kelley, who shines like 'Bones' McCoy in this second-largest movie. But as good as those scenes, they eventually do not progress in the plot and end up feeling more of a distraction. A great score from the always reliable goldsmith and some fun scenes in Yosemite between the three main ones is not enough to cover the gaping cuddles in the plot, and the shameful disgraceful attempts at humor only serve to alienate even dead traits. All in all, a wealth of opportunities that, while not delivering, have their moments. Watch for the pool table in the bar scene ...
