I read in a Stuff Magazine about some of the most beautiful, bloodiest films that Asia had to offer, and I immediately jumped to Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy, what a mistake I made. This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen. First of all, no plot what I expected to be plotted (see: "Revenge") turned into a series of events that just happened in an attempt to use their special effects budget of $ 14.89 and wasted studio time. They should have kept their money and not wasted their time or yours. <br /> <br /> When a large plot twist occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer gets a new identity and I didn't buy it. A feedback is given to answer our questions, but thought I was thinking about Showtime at 3:47 and dropped acid. The film continues and spirals out of control with cheesy graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> I think bitter about this movie? Yes. Did I see Iron Man? No. Was there a plot? No. Was it so symbolic that I didn't understand? NONE. Was There a Body Hammer? Turns hell out of me So take my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I have to admit even though I've had so much fun writing this and laughing at myself about this movie if you want to laugh, see it !!!)
