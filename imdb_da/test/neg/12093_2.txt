I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I actually had great hopes of watching this night on DVD. Mainly as I try to avoid reviews until I see something myself and form my own opinion Big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment, which in fairness is actually quite decent, and if they had made the film about the characters in paragraph 1 alone, it could have risen above the 5/10 mark. When it moved into the TV reality show territory it stank to high heaven. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully, but as a gay TV writer and famous game creator / devoted family man, he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I expected a flashback thriller like 'Memento' - unfortunately it is not close to this movie standard.
