Ok, I would see this because it had some good reviews, but this movie was horrible ... Just plain horrible. The characters were 1-dimensional and nothing that the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them. The story was immense ... The wind stopped being a plot unit halfway through ... It just gets completely forgotten. The visuals were was cool sooooo pulled out ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup. I don't know what this guy is trying to pull out ... it's as if he had no plot no dialogue and the movie needed to run so long so we can't edit scenes at all ... Foreign movies are amazing To create a story without using a lot of dialogue, this movie makes me believe that American movies can never do this. I'd like to give up watching movies completely ... Bad Bad Movie!
