I have read the positive comments on this movie. I suppose people who were in this movie should come to this site to give it a good press because this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I always see the whole movie in spite of the quality or lack thereof, which explains why I saw this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed once during this movie. The jokes were mostly very bad, but as the jokes had some promise, the handing over was off. If you liked it, you might want to sell the buds because you need to keep the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. This movie had a bad script, bad acting, poor control, weak plot ... nothing of virtue and was not entertaining. If you haven't seen this movie, don't.
