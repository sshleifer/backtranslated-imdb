For some reason I just didn't like it and felt embarrassed by how bad it was since I bought it and saw it with my family. We all hated it with a passion. It's a nice enough children's film, maybe the year it came out. But think about it: an outdated children's movie? What's the point? Children generally don't seem to see such old movies anyway, and I can't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Some children's movies (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed by themselves now, but Time Bandits are completely outdated. For your reference and I seem to be applicable in this case, I also did not like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap. So if you disagree with me on the corresponding obsolete movies, you like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible case of abuse that I remember from the 'evil'. Think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the Pirates of the C. movie, except for Time Bandits, they are not even extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I warned you, that's all I can do. People who rate this movie high must have wanted it from many years ago. If you haven't seen it before, don't bother to see it now.
