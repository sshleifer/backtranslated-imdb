Sideshow is a good example of a basic interesting idea gone very, very wrong. As far as horror movies go, and especially with the influx of teenage films at the moment, a movie is based on a lot of teenagers participating in a mysterious freak show, something you can have a lot of fun with. <br /> <br /> However, the author decided to make a very straightforward and very boring, very common tale of five teens who become part of the show when enraged Midget Abbot Graves transforms them into freaks using a pathetic machine. that mutates them to animals. <br /> <br /> The five teens are chosen one by one until the last guy is left, his punishment is that he is unable to join his friends and thus be alone. What a waste of waste! <br /> <br /> "Actors" are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so fun!), no gore (and it could have been so horrible!), no action and no horror ( and it could have had so much of both!) The director has failed in his duty to try to make this a bit interesting. His experience in soft-core has of course disabled any creativity he has ever had, since all shots are the same, with very few edits and little movement. The quality is overall poor. <br /> <br /> I'm usually not weakened by nudity in movies, but believe me the only high point in this movie was a few breasts.
