directed by albert pyun in its incredibly horrible but oddly hypnotic style, "crazy six" is another jewel in the crown of this decade's upscale hugo hare (jess franco?). "Stylish" overdirection, incoherent plotting, time-outs in the midst of action sequences for Eurodisco torch-season performances, all of these seem to be drawing features for our husband Pyun. Most interesting is how he always gets top-notch b-film casting, compared to Wynorski or some of the other video-controlled. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, and the very strange Burt Reynolds are not a bad cast, though they often look a little confused. Check out "Postmortem", "Mean Guns", & "Omega Doom" for more top-notch Pyun mayhem!
