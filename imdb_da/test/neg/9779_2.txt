I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I'm a polite person. This movie made me lose 90 minutes in my life where I could have done something useful for the human or just me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is poor, the actors never look scared! Although it should be a horror movie. For example, the scene is where Kurt collects his former colleagues' bones. He should be scared, but he looks quite normal. The film is such a clich√©. The only thing I liked about her is the dress she had in the last scene. And by the way, the end was extremely predictable, as the cocoon flashed quietly in the box. In fact, I thought more of a bog that was walking around in the back seat of the car. But it still didn't surprise me.
