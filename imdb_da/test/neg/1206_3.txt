Don't check for logic. There is no. But on the other hand, there are many really good movies that are completely lacking in logic, so why bother it? <br /> <br /> I both like and don't like this movie. I like it because the action sequences in the air are really good, you get to see a lot of dogfighting. I also like the F-16, which is a very nice plan. <br /> <br /> But there are just too many goofs, so I really enjoy it. I think it is not reasonable to want any kind of continuity, as it is difficult to make a really good movie - but I also think that there should be some sense of reason. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: Do they fly from California to the Middle East in the F-16s without air brake? I would like to see that.
