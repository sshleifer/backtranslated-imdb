If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely it. <br /> <br /> But if you like watching movies you can believe, Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90 action movies that follow identical formulas while they're not as clumsy. After two firefighting, I think it must go somewhere else I mean how many fires are there in a city? Surely firemen do other things like getting cats out of trees? Well, I was wrong, and the repetition continues over and over until the end. A good aspect of the movie is the fire itself, well filmed, and I have to say that I felt quite warm while watching it, suggesting that two hours of watching a fire without a story or spectacle would have been more suitable to my taste.
