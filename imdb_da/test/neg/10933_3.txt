My husband wanted to watch this movie because the review in the paper said it was better than the Fatal Attraction. Well neither Michael Douglas nor Glenn Close, I would agree. Not for conventional reasons though. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies to be seen late in the evening when you don't want to see anything that really needs thought but won't go to bed yet. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a really fun bad guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she is not even good, but she is perfect for this role in this movie. Everyone else in it varies from guy to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who crosses like a twisted Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The end goes a step or two too far, complete with the clich√©, not quite dead with a roar, you will still get yourself a moment and then there is a shot of Pinocchio with his frozen tree smirk, which makes you wonder if they should chill or just forgot that there was botox in the makeup. <br /> <br /> Whether it's a twenty-two odd minutes and despite being a bad movie, you should be lacking in humor for not enjoying it. Don't pay for it, but if you're in that kind of apathetic telly mood, then it's just right.
