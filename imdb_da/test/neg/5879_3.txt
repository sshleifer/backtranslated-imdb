I picked up this movie because it became a movie with a Jewish comedy focus - something I hadn't seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with an open mind and was interested in the way it started. The opening is well composed, and the first half of the movie gave me many reasons to laugh, and that's good. <br /> <br /> However, humor soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and strained, and I realized that I no longer enjoyed the movie. I have tried to avoid saying this, but the movie became quite "cheap" - not a bad thing for a comedy whose humor stops, but it didn't. I admit that I may have missed something of humor, not being Jewish myself and having some experience with Jewish culture. But considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of humor was in this movie, it is unlikely that I missed much. The idea is a good one and maybe, if a little more thought was put in that movie would have been watchable all the way through. I wish I could give the film a higher rating, but strictly speaking, it would have been better as a television series or as a series of sketches. There just wasn't enough new material for a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> One thing to say about the casting - the main role looked like it was designed with Ben Stiller in mind, but I don't think I don't think the movie would have been worth more if he had been in the.
