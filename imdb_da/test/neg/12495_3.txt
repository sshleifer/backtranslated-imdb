CyberTracker is set in Los Angeles sometime in the near future, when bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) rescues Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt by a group known as the UHR, Union of Human Rights, who is angry on Dilly to mirror the Computerized Judicial System, where robots are called CyberTrackers broadcast to determine and abolish justice over the guilty. Still, Eric Dilly, who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his shady activities as the cold blooded murder of a traitor, saves. The fine rebellious guy that he is Eric is not impressed when Dilly kills a woman & he is asked to keep it quiet. Eric escapes & sits down to bring Dilly down, but Dilly has lots of powerful friends, and he uses his influence to hit Eric and get his CyberTrackers sent out for him ... Co-produced & directed by Richard Pepin I think that movies like CyberTracker gives movies a bad name, I didn't like it much at all. The script of the Jacobsen Hart is pretty predictable, it doesn't excite it, it steals most of the ideas and themes from other better sci-fi movies and the boring mix of martial arts action and sci-fi doesn't sound as good. There are a few games, some car chases and a couple of shoot outs, but it's all pretty soft and forgettable. The film lacks imagination given that the film is set in the future and it is about robots, technology and the way society is run, and it is especially the judiciary. Speaking of where the amazing Robocop (1987) blended the fierce action and clever social comments excellently, but CyberTracker does not even attempt to make any relevant social statement or attempt to portray a meaningful moral message of law enforcement, the script basically uses the concept of having robots and shoot outs that Robocop did so well, but also managed to include a good story. There is very little in CyberTracker that I can say was entertaining, and that's what movie is about right? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin makes it OK, but nothing stands out, it's all unforgettable and it's not very exciting. The sci-fi elements are no more than the robot's side of things, and as a whole, the film does not look like futuristic. The action scenes are okay, there are some exploding cars and some shooting outs, but nothing spectacular. Technically, the CyberTracker is average, for a movie that is supposedly put in the future already looks and special effects are bad. The action was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is signing control of that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of my time, nothing here original or exciting and the action is immediately forgettable. Bad & that's all that has to be said, not recommended.
