probably the worst creativity ever, boa vs python was a million times better then this and it wasn't great, bad acting, bad effects and guess what the dvd is one of them with 3 hour previews within the main menu. probably the smallest scary movie ever, no blood or violence, people are stupid and keep using guns when they have no influence on these animals, the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that were pretty cool, my name is the island , just a rip off of Jurassic park is boring tiring and not worth even looking at but I assume the signs of stupidity are pretty funny so it would make a good comedy movie but certainly not a thriller
