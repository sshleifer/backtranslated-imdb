Ed Gein: The butcher Plainfield is located in the small American town of Plainfield in Wisconsin in 1957, where lonely Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives himself on a farm after death, if his mother and brother. The local police have had a tear of robberies to deal with, and when local barmaid Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) suspects grows, there is something that breaks down. Ed is a violent sexually abusive man who kidnaps girls and kills them, police will count the truth out in time to save Erica (Adrienne Frantz) Sheriff's (Timothy Oman) daughter ... <br /> <br /> Posted, produced and directed by Michael Feifer this was an attempt to base a horror movie about the true events of infamous serial killer Ed Gein and turn out to be pretty bad. The real life Ed Gein was only convicted of two murders and died in 1984, but several films have been inspired by him, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000) with this rather recent addition possibly to be the worst Gein movie ever. Although Ed Gein was nothing in this movie based on facts, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers, there was no car accident, although Gein kept his name other people has been given name changes, the kidnapping and the murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart, but in this movie it happens in a few days, and here Gein is shown as a great hulking muscular man in fact he was a scrawny, thin, old & quite short. As an erroneous drama Ed Gein: Placement butcher is worthless and as pure entertainment it is no better with a deadly boring pace and feeling for it, the sign is all boring, and when he does not kill anyone, Gein appears, works or just walks around & it is very boring. There is no excitement because we know who the killer is & it's just a boring wait until he gets caught in the end. There is no genuine attempt to enter Gein's mind with the creators, giving him no more motivation than him who occasionally has hallucinations of his dominant mother. There is not much going on here, there is a scene with a woman Hanging on a meat hook, there is a really badly edited scene of Gein, which cuts off a leg, which are the usual jars of bodily organs and skulls lying around and a little blood, but there really is not much here to get excited about. The film was obviously treated to bleach much of the color out of the picture, as it is not far away from black and white at times, I personally think that the lack of color makes it even more worn to sit through. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 1,500,000, I can't really see where the money went into a very unforgettable production. Although it was set in Wisconsin, it was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong for Ed Gein's role, from a physical point of view. Hodder does not look like Gein, and he gives a rather poor performance as he just stares at the camera that makes stupid faces. <br /> Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is crap, and it's as simple and straightforward as that. As either a fact drama or a pure exploitation entertainment, it is the total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it.
