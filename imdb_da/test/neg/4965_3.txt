I read about this movie online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it received and I looked at the trailer, I decided to check it out for myself. What a disappointment! It starts well enough. The opening scene was actually quite tense, but from there it is completely downhill. I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but by doing so, they took the pleasure of seeing it. These choices combined with "C.S.I" editing, use of music and montage, lack of excitement, scary or humor really pulls this movie down. There is too much foreshadowing and many "subtle" tracks, so when the first twist comes early, you already know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job, except that I cannot recommend this movie.
