I will give it that way: it tried. It tried to do well and even Luke Wilson got involved. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do so much. He cannot cope with the fact that the story was very flawless and the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The running "gag" with the bull was asinine. He was never fun and I got tired of the ride really fast. And the barefoot child was also weak. He hitchhiked to Florida? Yes, okay. The movie felt like an average kiddie movie at times with this underlining mantra: adult stupid, chic children. And the bit becomes tiring. <br /> <br /> But the only moments that were fun were the police officer Wilson drove around when he lost his trophy truck. I loved the little car, especially when Wilson put on the sirens. But other than that, nothing else was worth my time. "D"
