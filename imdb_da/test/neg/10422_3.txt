It is comforting to see that other IMDb reviewers have had the good sense of panning this disappointing movie, with the risk of spotting against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. These directors can be talented and artistic in their own right; But in attempting to pass this hodgepodge of eroticism and 60's chic as * in any way * related to Edgar Allen Poe's stories, they were subject to fraud. Either (A) did not disturb the Poe stories, or (B) they read them, but were so transfected by their own selfish agenda that they did not pay Poe any mind. <br /> <br /> Imagine whose metallica plugged into their guitars, cranked amps up to 11 and adorned 3 chords claim to be beethoven's 9th symphony. It's the feeling you get after sitting through this movie. If you're a Vadim / Malle / Fellini fan (Metallica), dig it. If you are a Beethoven fan (Poe), you want to puke. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... Here we start with a bizarre porn version of Poe. OK, "porn" can be a bit extreme haha, but at least you have to call it a Barbarella version (including, I have no doubt that some of Jane's outfits come directly from sets of the scifi hull). Vadim falls into his old clich√©s: the girl lies on a bed that is enjoyed by a man, while from the pillow comb we see apathy in the eyes; the general lassitude and enui of a woman who finds no satisfaction with hedonism. Sweet stuff, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place for it. And besides Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, Jane Fonda's horrible American accent and convincing performance as European Countess made the worst cast since Julia Roberts in the miserable version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. <br /> <WILLIAM WILSON ... <br /> Here's a great Poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes he is no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, see Star Trek episode # 27 "The Alternative Factor". But here Malle flashes over the central theme and instead focuses on ... any guesses ...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum Brigitte Bardot's role is a complete fabrication to reach that end, and once again the director expels a classic Poe story into a masturbation catharsis of his own effortless sexual problems. Do it at your own time, Malle. I thought we're here at Poe's dime. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... The absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst movie I've seen since "Staying In Live". At least Fellini showed some pace in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humor in the story is so great, I wonder if he just picked this coil out of his private collection of home videos, stamped "Edgar Allen Poe story" on it and submitted it to this collection. I tried very hard to find any thread of confidentiality with Poe's works, but there was absolutely no. The original Poe story ("Never Bet the Devil Your Head") is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims "I'll bet the devil my head ..." On a misty morning, the devil takes him on his offer . The result is the sickest and most fun thing you've ever read. It was Poe, the comedian, at his finest (yes, Poe wrote many comedies. See also "Predicament" and "Devil in the Belfry" if you want a taste of his witty, satirical works). <br /> This Fellini version? It is bland, fun and not at all fun (unless you find it fun to see a drunk stumbling over itself for 45 minutes). Here, Fellini's selfish rant is about an artist struggling with hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. Most of it is set for an award ceremony where Fellini strikes us with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic "acidic drues" attitude that we find in all Fellini movies dealing with cinema. Note the sarcastic jabs on the "critics", a recurring theme in Fellini's film. For anyone who looked at the critics, Fellini certainly spent a lot of time talking about them. In any case, I feel like Fellini just took some 8 1/2 outtakes, splitting them together and selling it as a Poe story. Worst "adaptation" ever. I think I put more emphasis on writing this review than any of the three directors who have made a Poe movie.
