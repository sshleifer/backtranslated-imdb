First of all, to say that I didn't get the edition I thought I wanted - I chose the Italian version over R2, but what had actually arrived was a 1998 edition - claimed to be a special edition - I never knew that there was a UK DVD release - but the promised biogs were not actually on the disk - just a few duff trailers. At least - as for the film itself - as I was recovering from "Night TRain Murders", my second genitalia player comes in the same month - this time in (an Italian) British nubile schoolgirls being offed and teaching Fabio Testi - (unhappy ) married, but nail one of his students - becomes the biggest suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is detective of the case. Sorry to say I was less than entranced. It was visible, but more than just wrong, and apart from the astonished cruel character of the crime, the "surprising" killing of Cristina Galbo, who was actually "spoiled" by the DVD cover telling me about it - Grrrrrr !!!! and a surprising twist that threw the "victims" into a new light - I thought it was very routine. However, it avoids the two "successors". with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit on your grave ") Keaton.
