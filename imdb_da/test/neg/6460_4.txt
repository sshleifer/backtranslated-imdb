Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari wasn't around in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are lots of things about this movie that I'm not sure about. But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami like Buddy Ackerman ?? and totally trustworthy because he is a great actor. Frank Whaley's Guy is definitely out of his element working for Buddy ?? He wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer who is verbally abused to become just instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes' Dawn, who also wants to make meaningful movies, works far out of Guys league. The ending leaves much to be desired.
