Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" is one of the finest books I've read. Unfortunately, the film is a sad caricature of the book. The disillusioned medieval hero and the lonely spinster with whom he finds a meaning in his life are transformed into the film into a couple of stupid teenagers, the big security agent and the conscientious sheriff combined into a dangerous villain - you get the picture? The filmmakers have taken a moving tale of love, horror and adventure and transformed it into a Z-Grade horror flick aimed at - very badly - on the teenage market. Buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - It will be far, far more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
