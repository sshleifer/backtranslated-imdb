I bought Jack-O a few months ago on a Blockbuster video sale, and at that time I didn't expect anything that was excellent. After seeing it, I realized that I was not only getting smaller than I could ever have negotiated, but also much more. It seems weird, I know. And it is. But it's perfectly comfortable when you consider the complete strangeness that is "Jack-O" <br /> <br /> The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow he is marked for death in the hands of a demented, scythe-swinging pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's grandfather-uncle cousin, etc. And now that the villain has risen, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell-raised resurrection task. Nevertheless, much "horror" follows as Jack-O chops his way through various neighbors before he fights Shawn to the goal. I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who might find something worthwhile in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made films of the time. The play is deadpan (except when it should be), the script is apparently a first class group project, and the production budget must not have exceeded $ 150. You realize that director Steve Latshaw actually looks serious in his film production. <br /> <br /> And yet, I enjoyed the movie. I can call it a horrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I was happy to see it with my friends and have seen it several times since the fateful first impression. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie unacceptable and unnecessarily time consuming, and that is understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously, you'll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable. It is therefore difficult to judge this film. If I rated Jack-Os's quality as a movie, I wouldn't give it anything. In fact, the studio would owe me stars. But if I judged it on pure pleasure, I would give it an 8 or a 9. I give it a 4, so be somewhere in the middle. I recommend that everyone go out, rent this, and form their own conclusion.
