I've been a great Lynn Peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 movie "Far North" and although I loved her in her second movie "Slow" (2004) where she plays "Francis", this is by far away her strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as you are sure you all know (or should) play the crucial role of "Driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than Lynn's amazing performance, I'm afraid this movie doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> Oh wait - there was another thing - the great creativity of editing to remove profanity for TV viewers. Memorable lines like: "You son!", "You son!", "Shoot!" And "Well, forget you!" OK. Goodbye. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know where to get another Lynn Peterson poster?
