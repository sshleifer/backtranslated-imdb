I had heard good things about "State of Grace" and came in with an open mind. I thought "the army of God" was okay and I thought Dutcher might have improved and matured as the film maker. The movie began with some appalling plays, and I thought, "Well, maybe it'll be better." Unfortunately, it never did. The image starts by introducing two elderly people - Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, history transforms into a very unlikely series of unfortunate events that highlight blatant disobedience of missionaries (something undeniably existing, but rarely at the level depicted by the Dutchman) and it becomes almost ridiculous. Success in this movie is his successful alienation of his audience. By the unrealistic and inaccurate depiction of the Mormon missionaries, Dutcher delivers nothing but anger to his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects the reality. Missions are nothing like the Dutch show (I myself have earned a Mormon mission I can witness this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasionally mild vulgarity. The conclusion, which I suppose to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone, was both incredible (though, the whole mission is gathering to see this elder sent home - and mother and girl are standing next to them Each other!) And cheesy. Next time, Dutch, try to make a movie that someone can identify with.
