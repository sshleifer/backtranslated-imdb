In my opinion, the end is what completely destroyed the whole thing. The original idea of ​​getting someone to realize that they were the son of God and the other coming was something smart. People began to believe in him, and his friends became the new disciples. People went nutty, demons possess people, all kinds of fun. Of course, everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a large number of writings to find the "third testament" in five days, but in the end it became this ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I do not want to spoil it, but I just want to say that it appears as if it was written by a teenager with very limited knowledge of theology. I hear they make an American feature version of this story, I just hope they change the eye's rolling end.
