This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Lots of wasted talent. Who lets this bomb escape? When Sigfried says that an example must be made, referring to a nuclear bomb, I said, "Let this be this theater!" Do not waste your time. Not even worth a free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill in the comment section on IMDb? I can't believe anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stink. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed "comedy" and made it a pretty action movie, it could pass. What was the purpose of the dance scene? Also the cool jokes and references were tasteless. This movie never missed a chance to go to the lowest common denominator, and scenes just finished, it seemed like no one believed them through. Just awful! Save your time, if not money, and give this movie a pass!
