I was thrilled with the concept of my favorite cartoon hero who was on the television ... and very disappointed with the end result. The only "amazing" thing was the wall crawling (despite the visibility of the cable). I didn't think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visible to another building than the guy who made the stumps in the spider. You could tell that they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Permitted, I can also spot the modern Spider-Man movies when I look at Tobey Macguire and when I look at CGI. But it is from a trained eye and experience with CGI. Nevertheless, the 70's version could have been better despite the lack of Special FX. The webs were hokey and resembled ropes that seemed to wrap things rather than stick to them. And what was there to give him a spider mobile to ride around in. Hey? He is the web sling people. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... didn't mean to be so worked up, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.
