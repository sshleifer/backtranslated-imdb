Enter Ninja (1981) was the first of several "Ninja" films produced by Cannon Starring or co-starring Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the star of the first "Ninja" movie was legendary tough guy Franco Nero. Unfortunately, even Mr. Nero or Sho Kosugi make this movie appear. When you have two dudes in an action movie, and it's neither visible nor fun, it's something. But I go down. Skip this chapter and watch the next movies in the series. They are more interesting and a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Next is the Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing the "evil oriental" (I use that expression in the tongue in mind). He's the star! Strange for a Western movie. See one instead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended except for die hard Sho Kosugi fans or Cannon movie buffs.
