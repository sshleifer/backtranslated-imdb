Most American remakes of European films are pretty bad, but it's in a separate league. In fact, it may be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I daresay I could have passed it as another innocent bad Hollywood thriller I had not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular incessancy), but a far worse crime than it removes all intelligence and depth of character that marked the original as a classic. The real horror found here is in the fact that the same man who instructed SPOORLOOS is responsible for this cruelty. Will the real George Sluizer please stand up?
