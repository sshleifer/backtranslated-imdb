This is basically your run of the mill violent biker flick complete with nifty slang, crash and music. OK, just snake and crash. It's a little over most of the second fare at MST3K, but it's still the same as running a nail in the knee cap: slow and painful. Giving away plot would exhaust my energy so I just want to say you are better off skipping this.
