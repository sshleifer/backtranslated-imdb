This is a very low budget film that is located in a place in a valley shielded by the radiation effects. Cast, an elderly man and a daughter, a beautiful visitor, a couple (a hard buy and mad), a driver, a donkey and a radiation affected man interact during the aftermath of a nuclear weapon. In addition, a unit sees the women bathing. <br /> <br /> They all have guns, some of them are shot, some are told to have children, others are murdered, and others just go away and well that's the movie. Harvey Cormann's first film, it shows some simplicity in film making. To avoid expensive sets, the actors go through curtains to enter and leave the house (ie, the studio). The location images recorded in the hills near Hollywood are the background. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say it's worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how movies with people were made in the 50s.
