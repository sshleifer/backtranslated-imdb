It's a shame. There is an interesting idea here, but it is completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad storytelling. The reason, as it is, relates to a bounty hunter of souls. It must be a fairly straight hunter / hunted story, but the director and / or the author seems to have forgotten what the movie should be when they were about three days of shooting. Things are not helped by the fact that the biggest villain looks like he has a cheap Darth Maul mask that they tried to pamper with liquid CG colors. Not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel it to ambiguity.
