In this film, Gary Oldman plays a defense lawyer who was previously a prosecutor. He is a little bothered, but plays more or less an ordinary guy rather than a kind of figurative or literal monster. Fun is, he doesn't pull it out completely. I think you can't quite get to normal from there. Kevin Bacon was scary enough. The scene in the park was far too long with too many false fears. And the odd sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to have come from another movie, although the rest of the time Miss Young did fine. This movie suffers from inequality that tries to cover the predictability. And failing. Do not want to.
