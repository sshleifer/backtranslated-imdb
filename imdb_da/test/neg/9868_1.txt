Without a doubt, this is the WORSE cartoon film made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup .. worse than the 1979 and 1991 Captain America films. Oh yes, it's even BE, so wrote Christopher Reed Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh .. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in another movie and it was only on T.V. = on <br /> <br /> This movie is "D" quality. I had a chance to see it on the SciFi channel back in 1997. I had heard it was pretty bad, but had nothing else to do that night so I figured I was checking it out. What a waste of an hour and a half. I would have been better off seeing reruns of different lines. Besides having the most noisy special effects and worse actions I've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not really corrected at all. Fortunately, a NEW Fantastic Four movie is made, and hopefully this version will make the hero's justice. I was hoping for a new SPAWN movie in the future, but it hasn't materialized yet. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this movie. If you watch the TV on cable, check it. Be warned, but you would most like to turn the channel after the first 15 minutes.
