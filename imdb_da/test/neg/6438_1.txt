This soap is worse than bad: it is toxic. Of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on British society over the past twenty years, Eastenders is the primary example. For two decades, this performance has celebrated the offense, the hesitation, the broad boy, the toes, the gobby, the violent, the sexual incontinence, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ... <br /> <br /> How many times have anyone or else noticed that Eastenders "reflects life"? Life on which planet, exactly? <br /> <br /> It is written about "working class" characters which are envisioned by the middle class people who have taken a course in creative writing. Are eager to refer to their middle-class peers, how confident they are with the "working class," they dream of the lumpy gap that is the citizens of Eastenders. <br /> <br /> This has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others in dealing with fiction, and then we find members of the real people who accept the attitudes and abstinence of the residents of Walford. Thus it happened that Eastenders reflected life; But only after life had been hoodwinked in the reflection of Eastenders. Other soaps have followed in the EE's footsteps, filled to their smelly gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling on each other and issuing threats constantly. This is the proletariat as perceived by the authors who produce this garbage can. The authors will grow rich in the benefits of such production, and will continue to enjoy the finer things in life in their reassessed enclaves. Meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new TV-induced drones will continue relentlessly towards cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> And there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. Much of this is due to the immense flow of the illuminated boxful of dance pixels in the corner of your living room. It's your fault, gentle reader: That's what you chose as the only window through which you have to look out of your prison.
