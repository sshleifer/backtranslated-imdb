From the recognition, I was expected more from a Korean horror if it would be seen in the same caliber as a number of two sisters, as some other reviews have said. This film is not in the same caliber except in budget used on special effects. Think Amytiville horror. With a tree and a sparse dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you are going to have a movie with limited dialogue, the plot line and the characters must carry the movie. This movie could have been told pretty well in a 30 minute short film concept, 2 hours with a lot of gazing at trees and terrain scenes that make you not only scared, but detract from a "what the ..." kind of way doesn't make a good horror movie . <br /> <br /> The people who say this movie gave them lasting impressions should literally have heart attacks when decent horror movies put it in.
