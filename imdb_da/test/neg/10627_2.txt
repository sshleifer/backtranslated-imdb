In what attempts to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks like a paradise so that the men who have hired his team can remind it ... bird removal. In fact, the nitrogen gas that emanates from the muck on this island is what they are after. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this movie - the island's location where it was filmed was beautiful. Otherwise, the story discusses itself, leaving the actors with nothing to work with. Result: A lot of violence, a lot of languages, lots of blood and a few shots of women topless. If you want meaningless violence (sorry, the story can't even give the violence a point, even if it tries) then this is the movie for you. Parents: Warn that this movie is full of violence and blood running R rating.
