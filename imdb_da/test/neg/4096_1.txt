Well, for this abomination of a movie I didn't expect any good. I find Steve Carell annoying and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there is absolutely no reason to have a successor. Somehow, this movie was even lower than my expectations, even though I didn't have any. <br /> <br /> Has anyone remembered Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty has ripped it all too many ways to keep the movie safe. In fact, Evan the Almighty had the exact same plot sketch as Noah, with the exception of a few technical details, it was just a cold copy of a much better movie that was actually FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Another thing was someone sick of Wanda Sykes' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every scene? It was quite ridiculous and dragged the movie more and more. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I had basically already seen the film ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty must be the most predictable movie I've ever seen. I figured the entire movie from the beginning to the end within the first five minutes and finally realized that it was ripping off Noah to the left and right. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you are a little unsure whether you want to see Evan Almighty or not, you're already sick at Jonah Hill and play the same role in every movie he's in, like Bruce Almighty and don't want to see a predictable, dry, spooky movie with Steve Carell trying to act as Jim Carrey, so please don't see this piece of waste.
