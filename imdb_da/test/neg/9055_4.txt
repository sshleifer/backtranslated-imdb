Eat Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who is searching for her lost sister. Turns out that her sister has become a sect that has disappeared in Borneo's jungle. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side, she sets off to find her sister. As usual, the actor is not of the highest quality, but you can get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spend most of the time on the screen with her breastfed female leaders Janet Agren was covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among others. Now it has to count on something! <br /> <br /> But I have to say that I find it hard to recommend this title. If you are a fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize all the scenes in the movie line a selection of few. And I literally mean that. Many gore scenes are lifted just like other cannibal movies, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies stuck there. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's one of the hard-pressed fans checking their list. If you haven't seen any Italian jungle movies, you'd rather look at CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and if you're an avid fan, you've seen most of the doing scenes in other movies.
