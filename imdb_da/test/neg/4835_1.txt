What best reminds me of the critics who follow this movie is to mention "originality". This film does not contain an innovative element. If by 'originality' you refer to pathetic action scenes, overactive, violent in violence, dull humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. So originality is something that Swedish films can handle. <br /> <br /> How Röse and Karlsson can agree to "act" in this bad excuse for a movie is a mystery to me. And how Eva Röse after making this movie can be seen on lunch TV that promotes it, just disappoint me. <br /> <br /> This movie does not contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just pretty bad. These two young directors have put together a rather obnoxious boy-fantasy, containing violence, comics and trivialized psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the DD masturbation in the kitchen over a microwave dinner is actually set to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic geeks that make up as directors. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.
