"The Quickie" tells of a decadent Russian mob family living in Malibu and ... Frankly, this horrible attempt at drama is not worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces himself to Mr. The Mob guy as of "Pacific Exterminators" with capital letters in general view of the back, which says "West Coast Exterminators". Eventually, the mob guys become suspicious because she is exterminating in a bedroom. (you h). In another scene, Mr. Mobguy Russian roulette that gives a hooker $ 4000 to bet if he wants to live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 to keep the money if she bets "live". Well, she bets "die". (double duh) Later she complains, it was not fair and wants to play again. (Triple Duh). The list of errors just goes on and on, while this intelligence insulting movie stinks and sinks in a twitter of miserable music, mediocre camera work, poor direction, boring history, etc. Take care of this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The barebones DVD I rented had no English-language subtitles or closed captions.
