Even though I sat watching it all, I had to say that it was not good. It was everywhere where large piles of information were missing on how things evolved and even inaccurate on some bits as well. If you don't know about Michael, you don't understand. You have to rely on your current knowledge of the man for some bits to make sense. The spirit was a little dramatic. Flex Alexander looked nothing like Michael, who was a dismissal for me and towards the end he looked literally gray. Looking at Michael as something naive but very positive, gentle and loving individual was okay, even though they still fooled him from time to time. To see MJ's life story, check out "An American Dream". It's much better, but the only thing is that it will cover up to the "Bad" era. I have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget film of MJ's life story, cos Michael You rock ;-) !!!!
