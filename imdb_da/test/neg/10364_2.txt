Every time I watch a movie like this, I get sick in my stomach. When I see a movie, I can see what I see in everyday life. When I go through my day, I see black, white, asians, latinos, etc. ... How do you throw a movie and don't even think about the possibility that other ethnic groups will pass you by? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose, but be aware. It doesn't care if it's going to be in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was a token variety. This was typical in the 80s. Hi! It's 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors Thomas Haden Church could have been more aware of his cast. Shouldn't actors be more liberal?
