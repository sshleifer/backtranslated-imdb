Young Michael Dudikoff as young Lord Greystoke was abandoned in the jungle of a Pacific Island as an infant. But instead of being raised by the monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he had not heard the war was over. And as a young Luke Skywalker, it turns out he fell into the hands and learned a Ninjas fighting skills. Good because they were separated and the young child came down with a case of amnesia, but the fighting skills did not go away. The orphan who is now called Joe Armstrong in the army and stationed in the Philippines. Meanwhile, his Obi Wan Kenobe, played by John Fujioka, is rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener on the plant and plant farm. Don Stewart embarks on a cheesy accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> When these things happen, everyone meets and Dudikoff solves both mysteries of part of his past and saves the commander's daughter from the evil in this Golan Globus Production. Charles Bronson was a little long in the tooth now and the Golan Globus needed a new star for their action flicks. Michael Dudikoff filled the bill pretty well and made a lot of movies for them, including several American ninja successors. <br /> <br /> This movie is everything and Dudikoff sends villains to a record speed. What he doesn't do, Steve James does his best Rambo imitation and shows his significant martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough holes in the plot to run one of these army cars through the history. But that's what the ticket group doesn't care about. Dudikoff certainly looks magnificent to his fighting clothes. No wonder so many successors were made.
