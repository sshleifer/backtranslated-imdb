Although this is the first movie from the broken lizard group, it's the last I saw. Having gently enjoyed Super Troopers and managed to sit through the crap that is club dred and beerfest, I was surprised to hear they made a previous movie. Now I was not with great hopes, but hoped for a fun campus romp. My friend asked me to remember that they are younger (of course) and that is their first foray in movies. I did and was still disappointed. Not taking the BL fire plays and comedy skills into order, they were ok. The whole movie was tiring, clich√©d and honestly boring. Some of the other actors in the movie were really bad at acting. And the Rugby game didn't even look like rugby. Bad view. They improved dramatically with Super Troopers and have fallen since. Let's hope they come back in shape with Super Troopers 2
