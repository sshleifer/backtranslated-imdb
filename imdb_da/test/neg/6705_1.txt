Despite the fact that "Adam's House" is supposed to be a mainstream gay movie; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is gay curious and a big slingsman and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in appearance; that there is a whole minute wonderful, convincing and naked beloved (sorry, no frontal) between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes in the movie (it alone can suffice for many of us) --- despite all that (which I give thumbs up up), "The House of Adam" is a horrible movie with most other filmmaking standards. A big thumb down. <br /> <br /> Shaw's and Cadwell's behaviors are either sophomoric or otherwise really suffer from the bad script, direction and editing or rather the lack thereof. Their beloved scene is nonetheless convincing and may have more to do with their truly being in each other, given the rest of their scripting and action. <br /> <br /> The Writer Director Jorge Amers (Bonus Feature) self-confidence that his movie does skills is off the wall. <br /> <br /> So the script and its lack is a thumbs down. Overall, the action is thumbs down with the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Career as Nina could have been the best apart from the limitations expressed above. Far away was the absolute worst and unpretentious play by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Anthony's father does not even have primary school quality. He really represents a huge casting error. <br /> <br /> The actors playing the new cabin owners are also worthy of really bad actresses. <br /> <br /> If only production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been something else. The trailer presents good clips of scenes that made me rent the movie in the first place. That, and the hope that this gay movie was apparently prominent in the game and glanced at gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a big thumb down. <br /> <br /> Is it worth buying / renting and seeing it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love that makes the scene and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really just enjoy watching bad movies.
