Yeah, that's right. If I had to ask my friends this question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" They can respond to something like "Armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "Shriek", "Plan Nine From Outer Space", "The Medallion", "Scooby Doo", etc. ... No - Don't get offended By this, believing that you have seen something that could be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer, this film is inside. If the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so bad that it really makes you wrong; then you don't know my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day, and a friend went to the local video store to rent a movie. Both of us had already gone through most of the movies in there, and on the "new movie" shelf we see it staring at us. "Wow, there are some good actors here man. Say something about the mafia, let's just get it and get out of here." This was undoubtedly the worst movie bug in my movie-loving life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: movies love or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water (or iced ....) until it reaches room temperature. Watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death if death is just blackout light and nothing, and then you realize you're just staring at your TV screen. Don't stare. In fact, you pay so much attention that it is humanly possible. This is no joke. <br /> <br /> This movie is the perfection of making a bad movie. It's not the kind of bad you can see, point and laugh, it's the kind of movie that's so bad that you actually have no chance of ever getting out of your memory. Unless you are using electric shock treatment to clear your brain. .... ... (Hey! It may be something that looks like how I remember and my companion felt after seeing it ....) <br /> <br /> Sincerely yours from you Albert Pyun. </ br /> <br /> -growth
