Something strange happens in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear or not cold. A huge robot plastic monster pops up and kills scots! What is this movie? First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. No. It was awful! The story was pointless, acting was 100% waste, the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong places, and bad everything. Not worth it, just let it stand on the shelf (or bin) you found it on. On the second note, this film was shot in California, not Loch Ness, a great diss to Nessie fans.
