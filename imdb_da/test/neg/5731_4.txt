It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering that he had not yet entered his own and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialect performance. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not as bad as some critics say, but it's not good either. It's fun and plays like a poor cousin of the Conan line, making it a conflict, uneven, bad job. And when you talk about the poor, the quality is terrible because of the era in which it was filmed, but that is not the only reason. The story here is inferior even to the Conan line, but, incidentally, it loses in the "Red Sonja must be dominated by great strong Schwarzenegger" pill and completely forgets its intention if it ever had one. It's entertaining, but in a low budget, guilty-pleasure "B" kind. <br /> <br /> It bets on a 4.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
