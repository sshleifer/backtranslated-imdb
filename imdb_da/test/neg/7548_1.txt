The priest of Bottom crossed with Fawlty Towers sounds good! Ade Edmonson & Rik Mayall, however, has managed to make a movie that raises a look. Ten years ago, Rich Mayall's crazy stare and Ade's idiocy were fun, now they are just annoying. <br /> <br /> The movie had a promise - though the most horrible hotel in the UK is not a new idea - but failed to deliver. The savings were competent performances by Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu, and the film is only 90 minutes long. Sorry, guys, but you really hit the bottom
