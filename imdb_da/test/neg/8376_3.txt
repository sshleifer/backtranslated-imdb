Let me start by saying that I do not remember laughing once during this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself to be a self-absorbed, weak and neurotic loser who is unable to cope with the slightest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word or forming a coherent thought. I suppose we must be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him through the process of complaining about a deep depression. I suppose we should sympathize as he stumbled through a number of misadventures apparently triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in fact brought on his own despicable nature. I didn't get the slightest hint at any time that Solo had any redeeming character, which became disturbing as he couldn't feed his dog for a few days. No human spark or conscience hint gave me the hope that he would ever realize that his life is so miserable because he is a self-absorbed, self-pitying life. I didn't develop any connection with this character. He didn't seem to break, nor did I. In fact, I wanted him to have his kneecaps busted at some point. The dog was not a sign in the movie. It was simply an attempt to be used, neglected, despised, abused, coveted, and wasted on a whim. So be warned. Although the "dog" is in the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> Scott Caan's role is entertaining and credible as the over-excited best friend / cad. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on the screen. Mena Suvari was very dissuasive. Lynn Collin's role as a "stripper with a heart" was well-acted, but the character was at the same time absurd and clich√©d, not to mention that there was zero chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Almost. Comedy? If you say so.
