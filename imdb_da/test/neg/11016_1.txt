I'm glad I didn't pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. <br /> <br /> I was sitting there hopefully waiting for something original and / or fun to happen. <br /> <br /> I recalled much of the predictable English comedies of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I don't want to bother with a synopsis of the plot, I suggest you do something else in 90 minutes <br /> <br />
