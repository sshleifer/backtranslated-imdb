Steven Seagal's late-time movie has not really been good, but this is by far the worst since Patriot. The reason makes no sense whats ever; It is never clear what the relationship between the characters is, who works for whom or who is the double cross, who. The movie is completely different, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than lead it forward. Even the action sequences are uninspired and difficult to follow. Most of the blame must lie on the director's feet so as not to even understand the basics of film making, but Seagal does not go off easily, as one of the producers of this film, he must also blame. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned how terrible the play is, even at Seagal standards. Even just as video feeds, this is not worth seeing even for Seagal fans. Give it a wide berth!
