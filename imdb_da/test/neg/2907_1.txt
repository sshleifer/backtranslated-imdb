An assembly prologue, clearly portrayed by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing, is trying to convince us that the magnificent incompetent bit of nothing is completely conscious. Don't believe it: it's Lloyd Kaufman when Andy Warhol is to Herschel Gordon Lewis. It is so thorough in its project of torturing its hypothetical audience that it seems like a form of misanthropic negationist art installation, only that cannot be because it is so completely deprived of self-consciousness. As unpleasant and ugly as "Things" or "Frozen Scream", it manages to get up in the foreground by regaining itself with a maddeningly bald insistence to be seen as being believed. A Hitchcock-style shot-by-shot analysis of e.g. The attack on cardio girls could give twenty edits and maybe three minutes of footage - only the sequence is ten minutes long! You will believe that this started life as a slightly more tolerable short topic, except if you took away the repetition what is left would be far less fascinating: eg. When the enemy enters the room, he only inspires extended, highly apathetic, utterly shiny stars from his imminent (off-screen) victims. Repeat this scenario about four times in marginally varied settings; bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue in total; offer actors even more hateful and lethargic than those in the classics mentioned above; and enjoy us with a monster consisting of gauze, ketchup and a yellow Spock ear, and you have a movie that is too scary to refuse, a working definition of bad. I'm proud to own it!
