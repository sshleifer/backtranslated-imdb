Good sadness ... to believe I've seen it all ... Danny Thomas looks out of place in this mishmash. He seems really uncomfortable. He can't sing worth a lick, and when he is paired with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???) she can easily .. Well, outsource him! Perhaps the director saw this and made him do the right bad comedy routines that he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is okay, but it's all a shambles. Good for a laugh, maybe.
