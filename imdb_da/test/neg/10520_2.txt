A blatant rip-off of "Air Bud", this movie is really about parents worrying too much about parents. All the characters of the characters (eg adult buses who do not know the game) are taken to the extreme - so much so that they are absolutely incredible, not fun. There is no reality for here, people and you will not develop sympathy for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the beautiful look (uniforms) of the opponents in the first game the dog plays. Maybe chosen because the setting is apparently near Arlington Heights, IL, home of Columbus Crew's franchise player, Brian McBride.
