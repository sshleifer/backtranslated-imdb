This movie has a pretty decent premise - a horrible highlight in science fiction films, most spectacular in "Alien" - and some decent "he-man" performances from the male cast. The occupied astronaut's wife, for me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she does not know what to do with her face in many of her most prominent scenes that I blame Director Corman. <br /> <br /> Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent play, "Blood Beast" could have been pretty decent. But the inherent inequality in the production design and continuity errors and gaffes undermine the case. For example, every time I saw the comatose astronaut put on an "examination table" the width of an ironing board, I broke into giggle, probably not the feelings the crew wanted to invoke. And the monster's costume needed some serious work; Branched parrots are just not scary or convincing. <br /> <br /> The past, however, was strong enough that I ended up just to see how the plot would solve itself, and the alien motifs were sufficiently ambiguous at first I could think of it as a riddle. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of a blow on it along with the plot development where the alien claimed to have taken a position on some of the dead person's personality. <br /> <br /> It's Corman. It is cheap, quick and easy to see if you don't think too hard or expect too much. What more do you have to say?
