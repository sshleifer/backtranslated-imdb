Oh dear - quite how Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, 39 Steps) could prove this unpleasant, cheapjack shocker is beyond me. Don't look for hidden depths or deep meanings - there are none. This is just horrid, seedy and cheap. The one redeeming feature is the inspector's home life that leads the investigation - his wife fancying gourmet cooking and constantly earning her outrageous culinary experiments for her poor husband. This is fun and has almost saved me from putting the movie in the "horrible" bracket, but the movie as a whole is one of the most unpleasant ones I have ever seen. I think this was Hitchcock's penultimate movie - maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
