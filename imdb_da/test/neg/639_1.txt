I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. So when I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought I was in a good night. What a disappointment! Such a poor display of "special" effects I could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you make special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert when you can shoot a real one at a much lower price (I think)? And they kill "muppets" ... well, I could do better than that in a few hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but I don't think it's fair to have a low movie for any budget. As for the "star" of the movie (I use many quotes tonight ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the guy is not even remotely an actor. Maybe he should have stayed in the martial arts movies. All in all, a horrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. So again, maybe not. A sincere 1 out of 10.
