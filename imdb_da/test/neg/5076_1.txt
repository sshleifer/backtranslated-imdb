The movie "Chaos" takes its name from Gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. What does the book or something related to the contents of the book have to do with the movie "Chaos"? Nothing. The film authorities seem to have skimmed the book (of course, without understanding one thing about it) looking for a "theme" to unite the series of secular action sequences that lie above the flimsy event stage that works instead of a plot in the movie. In this regard, the movie "Choas" resembles the Canadian action "Cube", where primary numbers act as a unit to mystify the audience so that the plot's ridicule is not noticed: in "Cube" a bunch of primary numbers are thrown in, so viewers will assign their lack of understanding of lack of knowledge of primates: The same approach is taken in "Chaos": Interrupted excerpts from Gleick's books are thrown in, making the bad guy's actions in the movie seem fiendishly clever. This is, of course, an abusive degrading treatment of the audience, and any reading viewer on "Chaos" who can stand by throughout the movie will end up confused. How could a movie be so badly made? Rewritten as a novel, the story in "Chaos" probably wouldn't pass it by a literary agent's secretary's desk. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away at what can only be considered a waste of time for all except those who took home money from the movie? As for what is in the movie, all achievements are called. Save for technical errors, it would be amazing if more than one roof was used for a single scene. The story is uniformly meaningless: The last time I saw a story breaking, it was the production of a literal eight year old. Among other massive shortcomings are the following: The bad guy gives tips for the police to follow. He has no reason to leave such tips. Police authorities do not carry or use radios. Dupes of the bad guy have no reason to interact with the bad guy. Let me highly recommend that no one sees this movie. If there is any other movie you like (or even just don't hate) see it instead.
