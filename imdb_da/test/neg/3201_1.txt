After 30 minutes .. very fast forward, deleted it from my recorder. The first Critters movie was self-conscious fun, the "conversation" between critters just before Granny blows them off the porch, for example. This movie just suffers and waits for someone to shoot it and put it out of your misery. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone working on this turkey being proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, four were just awful. Do not disturb, even if the alternative looks at reruns of a TBS "700 Club" fund certificate, you will at least get a little good laugh there (and "alien" makeup is more credible. Grin).
