If you thought this is the French The Mummy and if you hope for another "Vidocq" ... look elsewhere. It has the same kind of story as The Mummy about this death book and a soul to find 7 missing pieces scattered in the Louvre. I found the movie to be a bit entertaining, boring for the most part. Special effects are not bad, but it is nothing spectacular when I had expected big explosions and maybe the Eiffel Tower crumbled down until I realized that those scenes were in The Mummy, and this is Belhpegor. Apparently based on a French cult TV series, Belphegor could have been so much better. I voted this movie a 4/10 only for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she must be almost 40 and she looks great!
