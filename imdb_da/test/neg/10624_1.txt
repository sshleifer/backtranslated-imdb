Okay, it's a movie for kids, and it's not one of the movies that adults will also enjoy. However, there are some unintentional fun moments where most involve gaps in history. For example, the child needs a computer part to bring his father back to normal and he does not have the money. Then he asks his father for the dough? No, he steals it and gets caught. Children, if I ever become invisible, I will promote your allowance, okay? Also, while this boy is at the police station (undoubtedly being accused of criminal lame action) his beautiful blonde comes in, announces who she is and where she works, and then bends the baby out of the mud in front of COPS! To make matters worse, instead of making a quick escape, they sit in the PARKING OF THE POLICE STATION AND MAKE YOUR RESULTS. You know I hate choosing, but the child DID steals something and should face the consequences, but maybe in this movie enough punishment. You Avoid It!
