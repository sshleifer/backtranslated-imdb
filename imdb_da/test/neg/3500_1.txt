Terrible writing, highly constructed, from a "do-gooder" who knows absolutely nothing about race in L.A. or the United States today. Gushing positive reviews are a mystery to me - but could only be given by people who believe that good intentions of others should be welcomed, no matter how low, simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results are. If you want to see a movie that is realistic with modern L.A. Race Problems - The movie you need to watch (and probably already seen) is Pulp Fiction. There is more honesty and realism about race in any minute of that movie than there are in full 4 hours (oh sorry, it just felt like 4 hours) of this stink. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is paved with good intentions - then that's the movie for you.
