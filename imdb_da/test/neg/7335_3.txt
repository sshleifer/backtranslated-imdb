The film starts well with a mock instructional film about the habits of Swedish housewives. Then we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic equipment and furnishings; a minimal jazz score, nice filmography and stylish titles. There is also some fun Scandinivian rivalry as in Von Trier's kingdom. Unfortunately, after the set-up, "Kitchen stories" collapse as the Twin Towers on 9/11. Actors trying to portray the feelings of "jealousy" by just staring in front of them. Corny dialogue followed by stale homosexual symbolism in vain: "I don't like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves ... you've ever tasted carrots?" The music becomes cheesier than Yann Tiersen at his worst. It's a shame that the instructor put too much into this great set-up just to unscrew it.
