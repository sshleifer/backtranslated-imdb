Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions of boring, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a holiday so I could see this "world premiere". What a mistake! Why did Schrader want to make an exorcist movie himself? Great intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Far Merrin's struggle with his beliefs, presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting topic. But an exorcist movie needs more! The relentless boys presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, creates a strange production. Who is this movie for? I did not disturb the Harlin version, but at least they apparently tried to provide some kind of visceral excitement. The Exorcist series has been quite strange. The first movie was excellent, but every successor has been unlearned and meaningless. Why are they continuing to do so? I suppose Schrader did it so he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?
