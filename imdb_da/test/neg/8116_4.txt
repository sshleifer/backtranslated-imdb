I must admit, ashamed of myself, that as an impressive young teenager, this was under the horror-chiller pair of my favorite all-time movies. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's scary story though, I have now come to my senses and are able to judge Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably. <br /> <br /> Actual King's tale of a small Nebraska farming community turned upside down by a young demon preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is really disturbing on paper, but it does provide a cheap, average horror show on celluloid . A lot of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the movie to become a hacker-slasher show, and then becomes the final of a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare. <br /> <br /> the cast is reasonable, but they can only depict as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will give them, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is scary than the pictures. <br /> <br /> A real shame that George Goldsmith's play changed Stephen King's eerie short story into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Corners Children" are not really all that scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
