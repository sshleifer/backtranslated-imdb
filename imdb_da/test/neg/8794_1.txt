Chris Chan Lee's debut debut `Yellow 'attempts to enlighten Hollywood's portrayal of Asian Americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream movies. In this way, Lee commits much more violent crime: He exaggerates Asian Americans' own stereotypes by themselves for the incredible. The result? Terribly one-dimensional characters and an outrageously low script trigger the thrown into a frenzy of overcrowding, ultimately resulting in a movie that is physically painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by any of the positive reviews taken by `yellow '; each falls into one of two camps. In a corner (eg Right here on imdb.com) you will find Asian Americans who are so excited that an Asian character can be depicted on the screen without thick glasses and a mathematical book that somehow neglects the idiocy of Lee's final product. On the other hand, you find movie critics who have simply assumed that it would be unclear to give "yellow" the thorough bashing that it deserves; After all, it's an edgy Asian-American movie made by an independent Asian-American filmmaker's ... protected area for now. Case example: the main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Writer / Director Lee performs a monumental feat with Sin, by editing `Yellow 'in such a way that Sin never appears on the screen unless he either scowling or shouting. See Sin recreating the support of his friends. Scowl. See its walk along the beach and bread. Scowl. (Yelling ensues.) See Sin closing his father's shop. Scowl. See its urination. Scowl. See breathing. Scowl. <br /> <br /> I wonder if sin is full of Asian American anxiety. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Just to be thorough, Lee introduces us to his father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). In the whole movie, while sin just scowls or yells, screams Mr. Lee and *. In fact, this Bost's main role is in "yellow": simultaneously scowling and shouting. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Yell. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional character doesn't annoy you, his story will line up. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters found in this movie solely for the purpose of spinning a tangential and completely irrelevant love story into the movie. You can see, Lee learned in the film school that any good movie should contain some kind of love-related subtitle, and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. Mina and Joey's eerie flirtatious dialogue consists of one-liner insults culminating in a kiss: `Nerd! '; `Stupidhead! '; (eyes meet) (understand smile); (kissing ensues). <br /> <br /> But be sure somewhere out there is Sin scowling while all this takes place. <br /> <br /> Neither Mina nor Joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the plot of the movie doesn't confuse me so much that Lee insists on the most chopped movie clichés to reach his nonsequitures. And believe me, the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we find Woon Lee trying to explain his constant scowling and shouting to his girlfriend, Teri (Mia Suh), in what I'm sure Lee meant to be a exciting moment. What a surprise: as Woon invokes a metaphorical story of the homeland to illustrate his point torn out of Reader's Digest, he shook in the extra-special father's way. The camera stretches into a mandatory shot of Teri's trembling hands. We feel compelled to throw our eyes, unless we realize that Woon's explanation does not make sense. But lack of substance did not stop Lee from making the film, so why would he cut this particularly inefficient scene? After all, the world can always use another cliché. <br /> <br /> Now you say the movie can be painful, but at least it should be * a technical masterpiece - like "What Dreams Must Come." Sorry, on a technical basis, "Yellow" drawers Also, Lee's edits are awkward and disturbing the little rhythm found in the movie at all, but I'm sure Lee thought they would be hip, so to make matters worse, each frame is either underexposed or overexposed. In 1932, the new technology did not get on the yellow set. <br /> <br /> In light of the film's complete lack, supporting actor Burt Bolos, who plays His best friend Alex, works relatively well. you can't really blame him when Lee's script consists entirely of scowling and shouting. Bolos' castmates, on the other hand, show no restraint in their overactive at all. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a movie as bad as "Yellow" for a very long time, and I pray v foolishly that i will not see a movie as bad as "yellow" for some time. Don't waste it, see it; life is already too short. Thank you.
