This movie has to be the worse movie I've ever seen. I only saw half an hour and I just closed it. The cars in this movie look like two geo metro front ends smashed together. This movie is not even good at laughing. The only time I laughed was when Dante kept saying in fun voice: "No one can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa." I said holy god and closed it off. Bad, bad movie. 2.10
