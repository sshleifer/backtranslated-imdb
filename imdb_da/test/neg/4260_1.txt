This is by far the most pathetic movie Indian cinema or any movie theater has come up with. It's quite a piece of crap. The story line odes don't hold any water. It's shameful that such a respectful actor has bowed so low to making such a disgusting movie. The little respect he had was lost forever. He should have been retired a long time ago instead of fooling himself and losing all self-respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. In addition, I would suggest that Amitabh should already retire. I wonder how IMDb has made some recommendations for this movie. There are no movies so terrible that any recommendations can be made. Watching such movies as Devdas in the same line as this movie makes a serious injustice to a decent movie. its total I could say shameless.
