What a shame. This could have been good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film cannot decide whether it should be a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine nature) or of being an insightful satire of ancient East Germany and its mores. Its attempts at the latter flop altogether, however. The film does not hold well together and the end is very artificial and incredible. All stereotypes one can have about German comedy are unfortunately strengthened. <br /> <br /> The characters are stereotypes one and all, and the leading character that Kim Frank plays is colorless in the extreme. He just can't carry the movie and seems to have been selected largely for his baby's face. It can't be all the actor's fault (he's a pop singer), as the script doesn't give him much to work on. <br /> <br /> A plus - the recreation of the East German 'style' and period is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the movie feels somehow dishonest and dull. The movie seems to have been churned out by people who didn't necessarily give it their best and just wanted to make a quick buck from a couple of cheap laughs. (If they gave it their best, it's a sad case!) I saw it at the cinema with an East German audience, and I was sorry. The DDR regime was terrible in almost every respect, but those who lived through it deserve better than this.
