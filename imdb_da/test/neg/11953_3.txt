This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I give this movie too much credit! My best guess of the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show someone else's martial arts skills, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting with another guy and make people see it so he laid a story behind fighting ... and people still didn't see it. <br /> <br /> The story line of this movie was thin-skinned. The act was foggy and stereotypical of any Kung Fu movie. The headline was literally the worst I have ever heard. It seemed that you played a small role in this movie, as the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the protagonist with a net, it didn't matter who made your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and no one would have said anything. But next to all this makes the film itself with the somewhat amazing fighting scenes. The battle scenes were definitely what this movie was about. But the instincts of battle were completely absurd! In most cases, a guy appears either out of the high grass or looks at the protagonist from a distance and then attacks him. But when the matches started, it was so balanced. There were only two things that really hindered the fighting. The constant "wooshing" sound effects added to each turn of a fist or foot or sword, and the bad editing that made 25 percent of the battles very leaping and choppy. Someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked and then immediately come back on their feet blocking a punch. But while the clip and the inset editing were more disturbed than anything else, it didn't seem right on the overall movie. <br /> Finally, it wasn't a good movie, but I wasn't expecting a good movie. An amazing movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover as this movie is. All I saw this movie was a way to pass one and a half hours of boredom. I rarely say it, but it was just one of the movies you don't need practically, so you see it when you have some spare time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Hello gentlemen. <br /> <br /> -
