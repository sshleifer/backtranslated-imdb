This movie is trying to be more than it is. First of all, the play is terrible. You have to get past the incredibly poor delivery of lines and terrible emotions. The reason is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made of cords and balsa wood), and a few guys find themselves on land. If this wasn't bad enough, a guy named Count de Sade lives there too. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone crazy. Still, he has a big slave, a young woman and some dogs. There is another woman who does not speak and his wife is a leper. Still, things get bad, as these men have to deal with this emergency. He is arrogant and likes to make and deliver lines. The rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape. It has an ironic ending, which I will not reveal, and it saves some kind of movie. I wouldn't disturb if I were you.
