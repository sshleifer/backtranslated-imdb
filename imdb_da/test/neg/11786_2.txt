Only a very young child could overlook the absurdities of this bomb; The first problem with the submarine "Seaview" is what seems to be lumps of - rock? falls through the water and crashes into the hull. But it's not rock they are under the North Pole - it's ICE! Everyone, except perhaps to date, mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS. <br /> <br /> Then, disaster strikes - the darn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around Earth prisoners! No one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable because it is completely impossible for radiation to "fire," and although it may, there is no air in the room for it to burn. <br /> <br /> There is literally no good reason to overlook scientific concepts that are fundamental to 2nd grade textbooks when making a movie; However, Irwin Allen manages to do it over and over again; Maybe we have to focus on "the people" instead, which is pretty easy as they are CARDBOARD. The game tries very hard not to look embarrassed at this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp, much like later episodes of his "Lost in Space" television series, whose concept was swiped directly from author Ib Melchior and then rushed into production. <br /> <br /> Sub looks great, yet why get a "2".
