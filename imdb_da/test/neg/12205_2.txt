This film brought a whole new meaning to the well-maintained phrase "like watching paint dry" because it was like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to the film of its location on the west coast of Portugal, which I have visited. It's a robust beautiful place, and the black and white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was terribly banal and honestly you must have a story. <br /> <br /> A movie staff runs out of film and the entire crew then has to wait. Well, a wait is a wait. I can wait for a number 15 bus on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours at a train station in the middle of nowhere on cold winter Sunday afternoon. But the wait is boring and yes, this wait was also boring. <br /> <br /> So the leader goes out to America to remonstrate with the movie vendor who is throwing him in order not to do it all in color. After a series of arguments, two blessed balls from where and the long-awaited end finally ring and not before time. Yes, I wanted to watch this movie again if someone puts me in a pair of color film cans so I can throw them on the screen.
