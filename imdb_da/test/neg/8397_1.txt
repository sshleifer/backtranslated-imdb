How some of you gave this more than 2 stars amaze me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr @ p movie. The actor is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. It would deserve no stars at all if it was not for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some monstrous clownish tracks in there, especially those with oboe and sounds like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way matches the intended mood of the scenes they intend) and quality filmography. The dialogue and plot is about as complicated as a Dr. Sue's book. These actors are terrible. I actually see the movie right now, and with every word I am stunned that you all swallowed this shit. The only reason I didn't shoot the movie was because I was wrapped up in the creation of an IMDb account and posted this review. I dig mainstream movies, I dig silly silly movies, I dig retro indie movies and almost any other type / genre if done well. My brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has good taste in movies; Right from the moment he told me the title, I looked at him as if he were crazy. I have a hard time completing this rant because there is so much evil to talk about. The only way I can rationalize the good reviews on here is that you were paid to give this movie high ratings. It is so poorly done and not how close to dramatic, artistic, complex, well-written, well-preformed or even tolerable. If this was the last product of my hard directorial work, I would be embarrassed to release it to the public, so I don't even feel sorry for the director if he reads this - what the hell were you thinking?
