This is the worst movie I've ever seen, nobody bore. From the scanty look, badly lit set, to the ridiculous play, to the infantile plot and shoddy, drawn action sequences, this movie is so bad it is hilarious. For about ten minutes. Then you come to the remote control or outlet to finish this movie without experience. Although it was clearly made with the whole production and actors' collective tongue rammed in cheek (thank God), I found Jack Frost 2 so horrible that it couldn't be packed for more than a quarter of an hour. If you haven't had enough of this after this time, you need to be addicted to drug abuse.
