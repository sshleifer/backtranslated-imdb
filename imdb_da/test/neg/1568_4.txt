George and Mildred are a really unfunny movie. This attempt to translate the successful television series into the big screen was a scary failure, as is so often the case. <br /> <br /> The white and clever lines from the TV shows have missed out. The reason is a typical English farce of confused characters and wrong identities that are not funny enough or strange enough to provoke many decent laughs. <br /> <br /> Die-hard George and Mildred fans might see this last episode of the couple's production (Mildred died of hepatitis before the movie was released), but others had to invest their time more wisely.
