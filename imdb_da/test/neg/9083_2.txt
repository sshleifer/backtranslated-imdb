Once again, Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shocking 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what's out there today. The fact that "The Evil That Men Do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless tip that it is presented to. Interestingly, this movie seems to symbolize the last part of Bronson's career, where he has tortured many of his fans with the same really predictable and uncreative plots. It is hoped that this fine actor will rise again.
