I tried. I really really tried to think of something that would deserve to judge this higher than a two. It's not that I don't "get it" - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is infantile in construction, long lasting and painfully disagree. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are Alfred Hitchcock's mindset "Don't tell them, show them" then try to appreciate this movie, but you will still be hard pressed. <br /> <br /> First, Terrorizers are trying to stream the consciousness of Jean-Luc Godard and failing to do so. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but he is very unskilled on it. (Maybe he gets better with age, I don't know when I haven't tried other Yang movies yet.) The point is, he uses a lack of "show, do not tell" that really only serves to interrupt the procession of history. . Well, he does get some visually arresting pictures, but they do not draw the story together and they do not help to make it better. <br /> <br /> In addition, the great concept of stream-of-consciousness and "show, do not tell" is the right images, the right drama, the repetition and the close correlation that the viewer will be able to do. own leads; not to say that these will be the correct leads, but they can be changed as the story progresses, and each director should strive for some of this kind of audience interaction. In this, Edward Yang disappointed hard. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no need to be drawn in, no need to consider the characters or their motives, no need to be emotionally involved, and really, no need to pay attention. Finally, Yang is lost in history, which he will tell, not the story that the film itself tells. His art moves in one direction, but as a large dog he cannot control, he runs constantly and returns it to the course he wants, not the one that it naturally follows. The most egregious example of this is the end. The conclusion should really have taken place at the time of the man's revelation. The end of the book that the film focuses on (and as an extension, a possible end to the movie) has already been told to us. If Yang had chosen to end at that time, would he have had a much more powerful piece and left the viewer in excitement - does the story tell the book or does Yang's "real world" look different? Asking the viewer to think about this is the kind of viewer interaction that Yang painfully needs. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, detract from the natural conclusion for what? For the sheer sake of lingering on the protagonist - we didn't need to know more about her superficially, and Yang would not feel the need to tell us if he hadn't made her in a veneer instead of bothering her to become a more engaging and deep character to begin with. <br /> <br /> Why does Yang extend and torture his movie? To get into some of these "visually arrested images." The movie really suffers for it. It will end, it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unwavering, but instead Yang shifts on. Instead, Yang constructs a complex end that leads the viewer and makes him or her constantly ask "so what?" The first end, the one that Yang ignored, was good. The other end, well, my mindset was "so what, who cares?" Because it is not as if it introduces something that has not been performed in history already ... but the end? It was really a waste of time. Not only did the "right" end discharge me disconnected, but I also felt that it was a front end to what history might have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum-melancholy-noir-tinged conclusion he had insisted on all the time. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather its post production. Subbing (if you see it subbed) is terrible. Longitudinal stops for a second or two, while short is too long. As Yang quickly changes images, the subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of the rare cases that subtitles should remain on the screen, even though the image has changed because there is not much dialogue at all.
