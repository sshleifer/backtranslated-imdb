Ugly, heartless Hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugly and heartlessness from its audience. The scenes without Spacey reveal how truly horrible the movie really is. But the scenes with Spacey are just so entertaining that you hang in there right to the end. Yes, he could play this part in his sleep, but he does so well, he is so happy to see, so credible and wonderfully monstrous. Enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to watch a good movie about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's "The Player". This sad little potboiler is not distant in the same league.
