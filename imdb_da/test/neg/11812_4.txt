If you think it is beautiful to be obsessive about who you fall in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good rating ... but I cannot imagine this theme of obsession and of little respect for Others (like the way Paulie treats the teachers who are trying to help her) are all you want to teach your children. Yes, it's also bad how Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past those disappointments and get the most out of your life? Or does a better lesson fall off to teach our children? Second, when Mary's father did not come up for dinner, and Paulie helped Mary trigger his anger, Maria herself said she wanted him dead ... Somehow I don't think it's a good one message, nor that you deal with your disappointments through anger.
