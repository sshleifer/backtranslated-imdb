When the Spirits were released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how horrible the movie was because it didn't look like Final Fantasy. This is another story, for better or worse. The well-known settings, characters, music, history and the top action scenes should be exciting fans of the original game. The problem is, it's just not a good movie in itself. <br /> <br /> The direction of the battle scenes is often sloppy and changes camera angles ridiculously quickly in an attempt to make the action more frenetic, but only serves to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing. <br /> <br /> The CG itself is unusual, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more detail on characters, although I have to admit that Advent Children's characters moved a lot more natural. <br /> <br /> The reason is almost a black hole. It is a huge deus ex machina designed exclusively to bring Sephiroth back to a last match. Old characters appear again, but serve no purpose other than to delight fans. Character development is non-existent and the movie does nothing to solve any of the plot threads left after the game ends. But it is filled with nice giant scenes with magic, call and border breaks. It's probably what the fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, Advent Children is a very flashy, yet utterly brainless action It serves more as a final story to Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel. <br /> <br /> That way, you don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting Not helpful. It just makes me feel superior to know that fanboys / fangirls have regained my objectivity so much.
