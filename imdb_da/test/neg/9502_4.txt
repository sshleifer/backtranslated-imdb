(Only light spoilers here) <br /> <br /> Stealing Sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, pounded victims, and a few other sidestories thrown in to eat some time. <br /> You will see some bad performances around in this movie. The drama is forced, and humor makes no sense. Whether you look at the kidnappers threatens the victim who will not quit, or a victim's father responds to the death risk of criminals with "Care for some tea?", None of that is credible. This fits well with the category "wannabe movie". <br /> <br /> You will also listen to a repetitive goofy music track in virtually the whole movie. It's pretty unprofessional and doesn't add anything. It's really just a boring attempt to make a painful unfunny movie seem a little witty. <br /> <br /> However, if you are able to look past all of this and suspend many disbelievers, you may be entertained by sufficient history. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
