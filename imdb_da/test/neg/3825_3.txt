This film was the first of the 70-year-old movie genre in prison. This movie was incredibly violent, with lots of sadistic torture inflicted on the inmates. The film takes place in Phillipines, which resembles a terribly ugly country. No doubt the producers used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the cruel situation the prisoners were in. <br /> <br /> The Blaxploitation movie boy Pam Grier starred in this movie. She plays Blossom, a descent thrown into the torn woman's prison, on trumped-up charges. Her boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, tries to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Blossom's imprisonment was orchestrated by the corrupt Philippine government. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig stand out among the otherwise lacking cast. The film itself places too much emphasis on violence committed against the prisoners. Their captives used them only as objects of their sadism. This became boring really fast. This movie could have used more interesting plot lines and subtleties. This is not one of Roger Corman's better pictures. The many women in prison films that came with this were much better around. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage, only to Pam Grier fans.
