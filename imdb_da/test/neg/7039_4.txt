Weak tale of an evil warlock searching for a centuries-old satanic bible so he can make Lucifer's command by undoing the creation. Hot pursuit all the way is a 17th Centruy bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant sidekick Kassandra. Sounds like a bunker load? It is. <br /> <br /> This drive from author D.T. Twohy gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director Steve Miner (who fucked the romantic nonsense's "Forever Young"). Twohy clearly knows nothing about true evil. Julian Sands flies around and tiles, trying to look sore, while Richard E. Grant only manages to waste his rich talent. Lori Singer's career also took a nosedive with this. <br /> <br /> Special effects crew has fun, and Jerry Goldsmith gives a score that is better than his topic.
