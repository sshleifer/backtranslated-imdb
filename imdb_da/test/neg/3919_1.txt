Square pigs as a way to utilize cargo efficiently are the only clever moment in "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper has done worse, see "The American Way", but this film is far up there on the "cream of crap" scale. I think the best way to describe the experience is that "Space Truckers" will please no one. For cartoon-like too taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor and poor character development, ensures almost disappointment. The amount of beer and popcorn can tolerate a view, but everyone else has been warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all of the above reasons. - NOTE
