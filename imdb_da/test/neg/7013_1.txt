Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this bad excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The movie features some of the worst choreographies ever seen, with the constant threat Lucy might break into the song with her bourbon voice at all times. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer drops the movie before it can begin and apart from die-hard-Lucy fans, nobody will likely fire it much. Bad costumes and cheesy set designs do not help. Further evidence that Lucy was not good at anything except making stupid faces. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gene Saks.
