One of my friends showed me this movie yesterday and I was really amazed that someone could make a movie so horrible! <br /> <br /> Blend the most horrible clich√© dialogue with the most timber business you've ever seen, with the cheesiest special effects you know and you'll get this amazing animal! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is more fun than most comedies I've seen, it's really terrible! <br /> <br /> I was stitched under the stage, where the examp / vampire assassin has coffee with the internet journalist. Just look at it and you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> I honestly can't believe anyone did this with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but a really good laugh. It must be seen as believed.
