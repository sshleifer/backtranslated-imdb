This may be the worst of the worst. I'm a big fan of the horror movie industry, and I think this movie was allowed to be made. The action was young and the story completely idiotic. The camera's work was also young. A scene that comes to mind is outside a store. It is night and you can see the moon, but the characters have all the shadows that come up against the wall. There was no street light to be seen. A character is beaten at a time, but manages to revive later after removing from a post. Come on!!! It felt like I was seeing a middle school game. I expect the characters to wave to their family members of camera and mouth "hi mother". I can only give it two positive comments ... it ended and it was good to laugh. Please rent this movie !!!!
