What might go wrong with a movie containing a bunch of Italians pretending to be Flordians, and some vague-lava squid-crustaceans like the hell-induced hell-devil fish?!?! <br /> <br /> Everything's going wrong, I'm telling you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good MST3K episode because chopped right on the ball, which is easy to do considering this movie is a piece of junk with a miserable and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for un-MSTied version. <br /> <br />
