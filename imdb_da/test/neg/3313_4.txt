Specks of white and different shapes, a beautiful nude, random pictures. That's how this little experimental short film is. It is a little interesting to think about how such images in the film's early films could be transferred to movies, but despite my love for many surrealistic images and movies and a fascination with the bizarre, this movie just hasn't done that for me. I'm not sorry I saw it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, don't get it. Visually, it is not so excellent, in my humble opinion. As an example of dadaism, I suppose it fits nicely, as it seems to reject any kind of logic or reason, even though I would have preferred it to do it in a more visually interesting way. <br /> <br /> But to each their own.
