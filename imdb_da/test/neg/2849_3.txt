Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Long, confusing and unrewarding. After approx. Three hours of this painful mess is the end really the last nail in the coffin. Not even the magnificent, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this bad adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The reason draws and moves and time goes slow and suddenly you realize that you don't even have any idea what is going on anymore. In the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, is there still much left unexplained and so? it is over. A complete waste of time and no doubt one of the worst adjustments is to wear the name Agatha Christie.
