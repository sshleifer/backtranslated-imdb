I don't know how expensive this movie was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was filmed on stage in front of a movie cloth (it is certain that blue box would not look so artificial). As they traveled on a boat, the background sheet was moved imitating the movement of waves, but the characters did not move. CGI effects: horrible (I'm not sure, but I assume the effect was created with Paint and made a GIF sequence of them - next time the creators had to hire a professional CGI team). It seems that the CGI creator would have pulled on the image strip with shaken hands. Awful, that's for sure. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My jaw fell, I was so shocked, I thought he was funny. People, I recommend you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you will not enjoy it.
