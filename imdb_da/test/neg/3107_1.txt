Don't rent this movie. I ended up buying the "previously seen" tape of this for $ 4.00. It was close to the price of a rental so thought I might as well buy it. I throw it out after I finish this review. The film, which stars Lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow motion and poor editing. I thought I would see a mindless action flick, which is what I wanted to see, I didn't even get it. This movie is an exercise in slow motion, no script, close-ups, terribly edited and a poorly developed plot. I can't believe it's actually ending up with a scene where they think the audience cares about the characters. At the end of the movie, we don't even know who they are. Believe hype, stay away.
