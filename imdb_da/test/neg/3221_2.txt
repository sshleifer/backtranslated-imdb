One of my friends decided to rent this thing, luckily it wasn't my money. Almost wasted my time myself. A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing / management. Perhaps it could be a classic because of all the weird overbearing :) (Gary Busey's character for example) All the overlaid characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention (for all the wrong reasons obvious ), where the film itself failed. In short: Waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
