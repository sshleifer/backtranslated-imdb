I have seen many movies in my time, and this really stands out as the absolutely worst movie ever made in the film's history, anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, possibly because I was already tired as it was late at night. The other effort I managed to get through for 35 minutes, but once again I found myself asleep. I can continue with this, but I think you get points ...... Nothing ever happens in this movie. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. See it and you want to know what I'm talking about. If you can get 40 minutes in this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of it all, then you're actually a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not given as an option. I just thought the world had to be warned before either hiring or worse yet ... buying this garbage can. LATER!
