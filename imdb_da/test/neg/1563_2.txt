By strange coincidence, I have begun to see this movement right after Brice de Nice, and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than Brice de Nice, so I was really looking forward to something better that would make me forget this horrible flop. OSS-117 left me disappointed again - I don't know, maybe it's only a problem with translations, but since "Diner de Cons" I haven't seen any French comedy, I would call really good. Even when I look at the reviews on IMDb, only people from France give OSS-117 high notes ... <br /> <br /> For me, this movie didn't really work - in some parts just as fun as true Bond films, in other jokes were a little too predictable or too corny.
