In Moscow, the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to lead him into the underworld to find his missing friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) while researching the legend of the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I'm totally disappointed as this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer agreed to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb that promote this movie, and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review on this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and horrible movie: my wife and I napped many times because of the monotonous in this nonsensical story, and we used the DVD's rewind button to repeat every lost scene. But the right way should have been the use of the fast-forward key or the stop button to finish this crap faster. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
