My wife rented this movie and never got it so comfortable. If I ever want to torture her, I'll make her see this movie. I have seen many movies with my 4 year old and I can take almost anything. Barney is refreshing after a shot by Quigley. <br /> <br /> The reason, dialogue, cinematography, and acting were a step above (or equal to) a cheap porn movie. I feel cheated out of $ 3.69 that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes in my life, I will never come back. I would say that my 4 year old liked it, luckily it was a rental we had to return immediately. <br /> <br /> I just hope the younger actor's career won't be ruined by being in this movie.
