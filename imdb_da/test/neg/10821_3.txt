I think most people would agree with me if I were to say that the movie Alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere. I've seen a lot of movies that match that bar, but no one has ever exceeded Alien's eerie tunnels and dark halls. The Cave is a movie that tries very hard to reset the bar. I think the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as Alien not even in the whole movie, I have ever noticed even the smallest bit scared or thrilled for that matter. <br /> <br /> So now we got the ball of negativity rolling I might as well explain why the cave's main hook (atmosphere in case you weren't aware) fizzled in waste of my time. I want to say right now that most of the sets were beautiful and nicely lit, but what we hear and what we know is tending to ruin what we see. The music for one is horrible. We either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted music. Okay, it pushes it a little, but I couldn't bear it. The many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell). I didn't need rock music blaring in my ears while they simply swam through a hole. This actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was amplified by the following water crash scene. <br /> <br /> Whatever I already mentioned, it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere, heck no. The creatures hiding in the dark must invoke horror. I should be concerned that they will show up, and just a glimpse of them will make my blood cool. Cave wisely takes a side from the foreign manual by not showing the whole being for a very long time and leading up to the revealed with only glimpse, but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so paralyzed. I think it would be rude to ruin the specifications, but they are pretty much foreigners with wings. <br /> <br /> I guess you get the point now. Atmosphere destroyed. But I know many people who will still see a movie if it is exciting. I'd like to talk about the cave, but I want to lie. This movie is slow to come to action, and when we get there, we are so weird when it comes to calling it one day. We've seen all of this done better before, with the exception of a few nice scenes (the guy pointed out stalactites, eels and falls), so you really don't get any tensions from watching people jump from uninspired foreign knockoffs into endless tunnels. <br /> <br /> Ah but no, the pain doesn't end there. We must also take the signs and take into account. Now I can't remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" And the only sign I can remember is Jack, but it's only because it's located in almost every other line near the end of the movie. Perhaps the actors were capable, but the script did not allow them to do anything else, then run and argue. They had almost no background, and when someone died, they simply push it. It's pretty sad when you consider that the CGI eel puts the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> Talking about CGI; There is plenty of it, most of which are terrible. I praise them for using suits (at least I think they were suits), but nothing is entirely in line with the environment and as a result most effects look like looking beautiful hokey. So I guess pack Cave is bad and has very little for it. Had the movie been a sci-fi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release I might have a little more love for it, but this movie was a theatrical release. With more joke and talent this could have been a frighteningly fun movie, but as it stands, this movie is as scary as entering the basement and it's not very good.
