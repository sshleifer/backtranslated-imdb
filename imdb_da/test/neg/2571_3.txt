Steven Seagal has made a really boring, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!!!!! ???! This movie has got some action scenes, but they are badly aimed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A group of American Nazis spread a deadly virus capable of destroying the state of Montana. Wesley (Seagal's character) desperately tries to find a cure, and that's the story of Patriot. Patriot is a very boring movie because nothing happens. It is filled with dull dialogue and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors. Steven Seagal has totally screed into this movie and I would not recommend this guff to my worst enemy. 3.10
