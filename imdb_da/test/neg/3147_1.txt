I didn't see much when I was little. And I think I only looked at one episode that was about railways, I think because I liked trains and still do it. Even then I thought it was a baby show. I looked mostly at Arthur. The songs are also quite strange. And I don't think it's so educational. They just sing some stupid Nursery Rhymes. This is a stupid show, every adult who likes it is crazy! If you want some good kids shows, see something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or even better Pee-Wee's Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even better than Barney. Trust me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other children's examples that are better than this one. I can see many reviews here that many people do not like this show. Now there are some adult people. I hope they will soon take this show.
