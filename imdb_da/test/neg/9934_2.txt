I've been a refined Star Trek fan since 1966. Still. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. Encounter At Farpoint fails in his mission. <br /> <br /> Excellent produced. <br /> <br /> UORGET directed, written, acted. D.C. Fontana really blew this one. This episode is so embarrassing that the master tape must be burned. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season didn't go much better.
