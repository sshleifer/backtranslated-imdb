For the first 40 minutes or so, Luna is a great pleasure to see. The characters and their situation are interesting, and photography and places are beautiful to look at. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers his son Matthew Barry is using heroin, and the movie begins to rave and becomes so ridiculous in its illness. Clayburgh asks him why and when he started using the drug and she or the audience ever get a right answer, which would be a little helpful. He does not mention to care about anything, but it is not true, because we see clearly in the amazing early stages that he has great interest in his mother's singing, baseball, sex and apparently cared enough to turn down marijuana. This movie is for people who think juniors get into hard drugs because mom and dad were workaholics who missed their piano transition. I think such a dangerous and emotionally volatile substance like heroin was chosen as a kind of intellectual catalyst for the later incest scenes. There is much discussion about the mother's love for the son, but it is really about Bernardo Bertolucci being pretentious. Luna would have been great as a quaint little family drama. How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this movie than for something his character went through. ** out of ****
