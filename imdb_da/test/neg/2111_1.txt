Can I just start by saying I'm a fan of bad movies. And it's a really bad movie. It stands on the front 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but I think it is more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> The snakes do not matter particularly, the whole movie is actually just blunders with a little incident. Although there are occasionally a big gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke (bad movies must have green goo do they not?). But then the end comes together and will literally sneak you outside in hysteria. and that this movie gets a boost up to a 2 * rating. <br /> <br /> There are some movies about in the world that you want to show to your friends just so you can see the reaction when a particular event happens in them. For example, The arrival of 'Big Man' in R Kelly 'caught in the closet' 'LINE in' Shark Attack 3 '(you know it when you hear it) The arrival of the mama shark in' Shark Attack 3 'Almost all scenes of 'troll 2' The end of 'Dracula 3000' (just for complete disbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie sits proudly in this category. It's worth sitting through just for that. Then get drunk, rocky, whatever your married, and watch this movie with some friends. <br /> <br /> Simply, if you like bad movies, you get it, but don't get confused with 'Snakes on a fly' ... there's no relationship. <br /> <br /> And pay no more than one fiver to it either ...
