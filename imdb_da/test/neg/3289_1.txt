I finally managed to get through an entire episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Cloudy. Previously, I would always have to turn it off because I thought it was so bad. Seeing a full episode convinces me that it's really that bad. I couldn't even tell you what happened, but I don't remember laughing. For people who think this is the new All in the family or married to children ... have you ever seen them in the show? They are well written and well acted and most importantly fun! This show is not fun. You might think so if this is the first sitcom you've ever seen. I can't see who else would. I echo all previous feelings about arrested development, etc. It's probably my own fault to get frustrated with television and not see it and thereby allow the stupid people to dictate what actually stays in the air.
