As a great street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I really looked forward to this! <br /> <br /> However, it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose. Most of the characters I could not connect with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter movie so superior. <br /> <br /> There are some good points but the animation is great !!!
