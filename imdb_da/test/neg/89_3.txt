Artificial melodrama with a manuscript adapted by Mel Dinelli from his body "The Man" relates to a guest householder who takes in a restless handyman who can be homicidal. Despite solid work by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this boring yarn is not very inventive within its primary set (which quickly becomes visually boring) and underpopulated cast of characters (however, there is a clever pooch that senses the worst!). Hokey and humorous, with a straight forward direction from Harry Horner (maybe Lupino should have corrected?). Where is all the excitement promised by the ads? Dinelli also served as a co-producer. * 1/2 from ****
