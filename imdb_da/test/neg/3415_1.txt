This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in your VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are in love with two bounty hunters, but they are complete contradictions. She is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and completely spread the brain. <br /> <br /> In this movie boys are chasing Jersey Bellini (Dudikoff's character). This opens the door to bad Godfather impressions, ridiculous combat scenes, and Tony Curtis plays the most successful-looking mob boss I've ever seen! The end has to be the most ... amazing scene I've seen in a movie for some time. I would think Terminator, even the Matrix, has a better chance of being true than this end! This movie is just a series of fairness. The script might have hit someone as completely ridiculous. Nevertheless, the green light was given to this piece of fertilizer that had to be made and loosened on unsuspecting public. I watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated. No one in the group could say anything good about the film, except that it was over.
