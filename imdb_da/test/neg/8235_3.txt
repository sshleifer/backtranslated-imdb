Luther the Geek (1990) is a boring horror movie and is really bad even by Tromas standards !! It's about a freak that bites its heads from chickens and kills people by biting its neck out and he actually thinks he's a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because he apparently has been a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is very hard to believe after seeing how he acts and treats people throughout the film). <br /> <br /> After killing an older lady in a supermarket, he manages to sneak into a womans car and continue to torture her, her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend in their family home in the country. <br /> <br /> Then we are treated to a long-winded and boring movie of horrible plays all the way through, before an useless politician comes up to try to kill Luther once and for all !! Oh, and the movie has a ridiculous and ridiculous ending too !!! I love low budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is an all-time classic, but I'm afraid Luther the Geek is just boring, illogical and boring, not much in the way of doing too, just one new bloody neck bits and thats about it! 3.10
