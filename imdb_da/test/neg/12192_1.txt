I love theirs this movie. My colleagues are always trying their best to defend it, probably for love of Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this should be worth it. Here are some great reasons why: A: The reason goes from the kidnapping road trip movie to the vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick without any construction whatsoever. Suddenly, something very right to something very false, which is like putting the audience down to a Thanksgiving party and exploding it with dynamite. B: The unsigned Juliette Lewis is in it. C: Preaching ideas abound as actual torso and leg guitars, brothers with the surname "Gecko", bad vampire make-up job, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?) And a cross-based gun that only burns when "erect" "and belongs to a guy who goes by the" Sex Machine. " If Robert Rodriguez was not pathetically trying to be so innovative with his violence, I could have had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. The whole project is as if he got the ideas by playing with action characters. The only thing that is even close to being considered my favorite scene is George Clooney's scary cheesy monologue after killing his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terribly acting brother. I swear I think they believed it right then and there. This movie is out to offend and end up insulting those who want the offensive. Horrible movie.
