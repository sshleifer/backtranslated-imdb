Some guy named Karl Rhamarevich learns to live on even after death through telekinesis. He is interred in a mausoleum. That same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) must stay there to enter a group called "The Sisters". And Karl's "power" is in full bloom. <br/> <br /> Silly movies. I saw it in a theater when I was 21 and was generally sorry. The PG rating should have turned me off - it's a horror movie for kids. A really stupid scene at the end has an equal mind through concrete hitting a young guy! Initially, the head is ligated first, making it impossible for the body to use its arms, and there is no way anyone should break through concrete. When you notice stupid mistakes like this, the movie doesn't do its job. <br /> <br /> It has two good scenes - two of "The Sisters" are being "attacked" by floating bodies penetrating into them. At one point one of the sisters sticks a corpse into her stomach - her hand goes into the body and she can't pull it out! That scene has been with me since then. And there is a sweet little bit that involves a body and a toothbrush at the end (which had my audience laughing). But the rest of the movie is a weak, boring memory. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give it a 3.
