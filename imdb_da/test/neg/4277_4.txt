This version of Mansfield Park, while being extremely accurate to the novel, lacked the compassion I felt for Fanny, which is crucial and central to this Jane Austen story. This was due to the total lack of plays by the actor Sylvestra Le Touzel. She had no appeal and at times seemed to be either lost in space or out of her depth. The scene she has with her uncle, where she breaks into hysteria, was hysterical. She exaggerated much over the decisive scene, and I actually felt sorry for Henry Crawford's ever worried about her. <br /> <br /> The polar opposite is the depiction of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make this character witty and self-centered, selfish, yet vulnerable to love. I've always loved Fanny. She is gentle but with an irreconcilable sense of what is right and who she thinks is worth respecting and admiring. Fanny in this adaptation is too subdued and entertaining with hardly a thought of her own to almost the end of the series. As much as I liked this Fanny .... I just couldn't. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for the right thing ... The novel. Fanny won't disappoint ... you will love her!
