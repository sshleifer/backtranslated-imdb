It is a film that casts light on the beggar of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but it does not show the real feelings of the people then and how they were fooled into believing that they could soon return to their home, it does not mention the massacres committed by the Jews like Der Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed a Palestinian freedom fighter's family, it lacked the credibility of the real Palestinian struggle and of any Palestinian, but it has something about the suffering of Palestinian citizens ending As refugees in the neighboring Arab countries, the film focuses on the story of the man in coma, he is now in the present and through his history we see the film. The movie just tells the life of a person and has some nudity scenes that are irrelevant to the story.
