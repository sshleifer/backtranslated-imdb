This movie is a nonsense / spoof comedy, in the lines of The Airplane or Naked Gun, but it doesn't even come close to this two because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes, rather than just throwing you the same old simple jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find some references to other movies, from the top of my head I identified Dodgeball and Rocky so you can have fun with it and try to find out which movies are spoofed. <br /> <br /> The movie also gives you occasional laughs, but nothing that can cause you any harm and hence nothing really fun. <br /> <br /> I liked the character iPod in some ways (even though some of the jokes with him are standard comedy 101). I think this movie (and like most of the nonsense / spoof comedy) depends on the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh at any joke watch this movie. If you are in a serious mood, forget about this (see) the airplane instead, it will definitely make you laugh
