I liked all the Lilo and Stitch movies. The TV series was not that big, but I put aside my opinions of the series when I watched this movie. And I have to say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yeah, you've heard it. Animation. I found its quality greatly impaired since the first movie. Its quality was only as high as the TV series', something I did not expect at all. If you're looking for eye candy, don't expect much here. The animation also failed to portray serious moods. Even in the supposedly sad scenes, I didn't feel anything for the character, another downgrade from the first movie. The next was the absolutely horrible voice acting. I found it very, very convincing, and wondered why Disney could not afford real talent with all its wealth and glory. The voice actors' skill was just as annoying as the one in the series. I tolerated it in the series because hey, who wouldn't be tired when they were made to vote for so many episodes? Heck, I don't even know how many episodes there are (Theoretically, there are 624, but I just can't believe it). But I thought the voice worked better in the movie, and I was put down in the face with the truth that what they could do in the series was already their best. Next was the horrible script. It was cheesy beyond redemption, and the authors just tried too hard. They're trying to put some jokes in, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it was not the voice, but the osteic dialogues that destroyed the sound section. (On the upper side, the soundtrack was not so bad, and the mood was quite good.) Fourth, the problem was with the story. I predicted everything, and the story was what made the characters so unoriginal and unruly suddenly. You have foreigners get new positions and responsibilities inout space. After the first hype, they realize that they did not actually like it and miss their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil villain has broken out of prison after a very action-packed action scene and breaks into the Jumba lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned in 100 others, and the hamster wants to conquer the earth. When the protagonists find out, they try to stop the evil hamster, but are confronted with a cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely bad excuse to try to make the series look cool. The characters then give their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other movies have used what ends already? The story was extremely short and formal, so don't expect too much from it. <br /> <br /> So, Disney has failed in sound, graphics and history. The series' only charm was the original characters, and how they managed to preserve the characters' feeling ', but even that couldn't save the movie. I tried to like it, I really did, but I give it a rating of 4/10. Another Disney bug.
