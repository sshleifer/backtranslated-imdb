"Love Life" explores a highly culturally relevant scenario of a convenient marriage between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject convincing, even though the conflict was a little forced and too easy to solve. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently to the plot. There are many continuity errors: Another user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... the one who made me the most was that Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end, I found myself more connected to this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all a couple of times with the porn stars' skill and exhaustion, and too often chops act to match. Many times the movie seems to be full porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a good job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a little to me as I was in the mood for a good treasure in the shower at the end of this movie.
