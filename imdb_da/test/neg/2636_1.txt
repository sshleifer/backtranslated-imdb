This movie was crap. The script is so full of holes; I can't see how the producers agreed to fund it. <br /> <br /> We never get an explanation for anything. The action is horrible. The ground sucks. This film was of course written for the 8 and under. <br /> <br /> I have to say this: Why is high school only 2 minutes long? The teacher enters, finds a seed in the table or pulls on the board, and 30 seconds later the bell rings, the class is over. The kids haven't even opened their books. Can we at least have a small continuity? <br /> <br /> Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the reincarnated, interrupted fetus, zombie thing. Do we really need the line, "This is Dr. Jeter's office. Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the tip; I could never put it together myself. It never gets better. Why does Milo speak as he does, even in the beginning? Milo was ever `real '. Or was he never really, just always what he is at the moment? And if that was always the case, why did the unexplained "accident" Milo have? <br /> <br /> In addition to "What is Milo?", what are all the unsolved things for? We see all of these issues in his father's medical office and never get an explanation of what they are or what to do with history. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium contraction? Of course, they are not necessary. (See the movie, it makes sense). And what does this medicine do to anyone? Apparently nothing, as it has no influence on the leading actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very, very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies. It's a really awful Friday the 13th / Halloween merged by a 10-year-old author. It's not enough cheese to laugh, it's just an incredibly frustrating drill.
