It's the only scariest thing I've ever seen. It's boring how he tries so hard to make a good joke, and all he does is curse and thinks his obnoxious vulgarity is fun. He's the most bitter person I've ever seen. His whole action he tries to show how much he does not care and only by showing how much he is angry with the critics and the people with every taste and sense of humor who would rather undergo enormous torture than to see his "showing ". There are good comedians who are bad and there are terrible. But this guy is in a separate league. I'm sorry for him and even more for the people who find him fun.
