Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play Woodroe F. Call better than he. Not only was he the first and best, he was the only person who could portray his grief and confusion. It was a bad disappointment and I am surprised that I made myself see it. I can even begin how so pitiful they did Woodroe. I understand he would be old at that time, but everyone knows he would never let him down. The first movie was the best and the only one I will ever see. I hope in God that no more directors are planning to continue or transform the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, the movies are meaningless waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE ANOTHER LONESOME DOVE MOVIE OF ANY CHILD, take mine and billions of others, don't waste time. Continuing the movies is just painting the first in the ground. Thanks.
