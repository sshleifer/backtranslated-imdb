If you saw Pulp Fiction do not watch this movie. This movie is not fun. This is the worst parody ever. This is a bad attempt at parody movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is poor. The movie is bad. This is one of the worst pictures ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction of the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody films ever made. <br /> <br /> Plum fiction is not a good movie. It is not fun. It's so stupid and vulgar.
