But it must be said that perhaps more in America than say, here in Britain it can still be a breathtaking topic. Just look at the whole debate of gay men in the military some years ago in the United States. It is with 'In and Out' that the author Paul Rudnick tapers into Central America's small town and the way the press in the United States (as well as in the UK) makes such a great chance of practicing a celebrity. You only need to look at when Will Young and Stephen Gately from Boyzone came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> The film centers on Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school English teacher in his hometown. People are preparing for Oscar Night when one of the nominated Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) came from their city and was a former Howard student. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a Vietnam epic, wins the award only to Howard as gay during his acceptance speech. This could not be a worse time for Howard, who is just getting married to his fiance and fellow teacher Emily (Joan Cusack). As you would expect, the media reaction is disastrous and turn Howard's life upside down. Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but avoids sleazy news reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Even though this was billed as a screw basketball comedy, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical. You only need to look at the early stages of Oscar's cerimonee and how the people of Bracket's hometown as well as school education react to his excursion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not live up to the promise we see early in the film. This is a pretty flat attempt to make social comments out of a crazy comedy. A good cast is unfortunately wasted on a script that never really delivers the scary amount of laughs and is not as close and insightful as it thinks. <br /> <br /> Kline gives us the same kind of boyfriend performance he gave us in his previous comedy 'Dave', making Howard an instant sympathetic character. Cusack is also good value as Howard's weighty fianc√©, while Tom Selleck plays very well against the type as a gay reporter. Bob Newhart is also a joy as the main college where Howard works. It's great to see him on the big screen for a change. It's a shame it should be this. The performances as good as they can do a little to save the movie from being a rather boring affair. While a few scenes do enjoy the inspired scene where Howard tries to make himself seem more masculine by listening to a self-help tape. There is little to enjoy, and when things can't seem to get any worse Rudnick resorts to a malignant finale that lurches into over the top mood. I couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was offended. Alloy seems to be too obscure a sign to become the man who puts his ethics before he gets a good story, while Cammeron finally comes to the rescue in the film's climax, seems to be too self-contained a sign of nurturing one story of what happens to his former teacher. After all, he was the one who caused all the problems in the first place. <br /> <br /> 'In and Out' is not straightforward but when you consider that as Klines they work better as 'A fish called Wanda', you can't help feeling that here is a great talent which is unfortunately wasted. <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
