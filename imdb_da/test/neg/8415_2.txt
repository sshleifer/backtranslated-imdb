I was hoping that Pulp would be an interesting movie, but was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pulp has very little history and what is never, keeps your interest. It was a real struggle to keep an eye on it. When it says to you, "huh? That's it?!?" This is one where you are thinking of seeing it - why have they ever threatened? <br /> <br /> It's too bad as Michael Caine is a good actor. I also hoped to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on the screen for just a minute or so. Scott is one of the all time amazing movie noir femme fatal girls, and this was her last movie. <br /> <br /> Oh well ...
