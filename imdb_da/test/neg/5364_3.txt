I'm a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters so when this show came out I decided to try. I could hardly sit through an episode. The show is so obviously staged. I mean, come on, every episode involves someone who possesses or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another big mistake is that these guys never debunk anything. When I see Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to disprove it, and if they can't, then it's proof. On this show, they find a voice or piece of video evidence, and they are very quick to call it a ghost. This totally destroys their credibility as opposed to TAPS and Ghost Hunters who actually know what they are doing. Honestly, if you are interested in the paranormal and want to see a show about it, see Ghost Hunters.
