The director was probably still in his early learning phases when he tried his hand at Western. Look at the clothes. Everybody looks good scrubbed, well brushed, well-dressed and well ironed as if ready for church. Even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is a WESTERN, to cry aloud! It must look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there is the amateurish act of the females in this bird. The whole party, a dozen or so, all beautiful and well-founded, was just recently raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. Instead, they all look with great interest (if not exactly desire) by the newly arrived grand seven, after which the subsequent feeds, bandages and consoles with love during their struggles with the bandits. The same direct criticism goes to Lee van Cleef, who does a reasonably well-functioning job. Our Lee, who played the law, just lost his dear wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion at all and finds himself within days of his spouse's death in a juicy widow with whom he, along with her flesh, goes out in the future. Cad. And then there's another thing that always hurts me with this type of movie: it doesn't matter how many dynamite-induced explosions take place in the middle of a pack of about 50 horses, then you're not sure how many shots are fired on the raven on top of them, only the bad guys are killed and the rivets always delight in one piece. (I know ... silly moi ... it's just a movie ...). It's not the worst Western ever made, but prepare for some serious yawning.
