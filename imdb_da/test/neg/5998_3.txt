Jackie Chan films are typical examples of how the offer is greater than the demand. Well, to be honest, what demand? In this one, Jackie Chan, regardless of his name in this, I doubt if he himself knows and he is a kind of race car driver. Well, he runs 10 miles an hour and then the recordings are up, so I can do all the stunts myself. During the big final, where Jackie Chan will arrest the evil guy by beating him in a race, we finally see how shoddy this production really is. His fight, especially in the casino scene, is decent, but when we talk about special effects, dear Lord. And should all crash in this race? It's just stupid. And here it is really not safe for the drivers, there is not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood. And let me not start with what kind of horrible story this has, I think it is Hong Kong, it was probably written at a gun point of eight year olds, but still what a mess. I like Chan as much as the next guy, maybe more since I saw "Rush Hour" but his agent's retarded cousin must really choose his projects better.
