May contain coils. This movie was the worst movie ever. I couldn't even see it all, it was so bad. This movie is actually worse than scarecrow slayer who says a lot. This was worse than terrorist tones, which at least was fun at times fun. Not even doing in the movie was good. The shootings were fake and the play was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you see it at the rental shop, you drive the other way. There is nothing good about this movie at all. If you want to watch a good scarecrow movie then watch the Night of Scarecrow or Pumpkin Head. If you want to see an OK new cheesy movie then watch Scarecrow. I rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. It's so terrible that this movie really is. The worst movie ever.
