I don't want to go into detail about why this movie deserves a terrible rating, many others have already done so. That's enough to say that out of the over 400 movies I've owned on DVD, it's the only one I got rid of - it was so worthless that I couldn't ever see any of it again. br /> <br /> However, I have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (from 3-15-06). While skimming through the 4 sides of reviews I saw no rating higher than 3 stars. In view of the vote, 78% of users rated the film as 4 stars or less. It seems that a few people fill the ballot to keep this movie off the IMDb "bottom 100" list. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of them wrote a review of the movie) are current active users. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled, this movie is not worth your time.
