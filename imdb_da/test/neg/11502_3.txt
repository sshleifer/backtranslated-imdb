this show is okay and fun to watch, it's a fantastic Disney channel show and sometimes entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season, but I hated the second and third season. This show has completely changed. In the first season, it was more about science and animals, everything that is gone now in the season and third season. Its more about her life and dating. Ever since the gay child (Ben) came together, this show has sucked. The authors took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse. I can no longer see the latest episodes, they are all garbage.
