I think it's a reason this movie never came close to hitting theaters. There were probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. The actor is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you would like to see unless you were very sad. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members without any "professionalism" at all. If the instructors and / or actors choose to continue their efforts to make films, I would definitely recommend them to brush their skills and perhaps take some (ok, many) classes on film making and acting.
