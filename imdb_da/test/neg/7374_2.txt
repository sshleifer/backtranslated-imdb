It's the worst movie I've seen since a long time. Historical accuracy is completely non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, pictured as an anti-French Canadian, is shown in London during the summer of 1759. Natives are like Indians of a poor Hollywood movie from the 60s: they wear leather clothes and ride horses (Montagna's never had ride horses). The movie takes place in Quebec City, but footage is set in Louisbourg, showing the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The original scenario was supposed to include the battle of Abraham's plains, but the producers avoid this idea that uniforms and attendees would be over $ 4 million! I think they have never heard of resumption. <br /> <br /> All the movie is scheduled to be a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historic tragedy (New-France fall). There is even a song by Celine Dion at the end of the movie (Yes, I was at the end of the movie, but I'm deeply sorry). But the worst thing is that this movie costs $ 30 million. I just don't know how to spend all that money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my anger, but I'm just too annoyed.
