I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I've ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this. <br /> <br /> The reason ... there's no plot. Everything you would expect to do, it only does it in a worse way. The action was horrible. My dog ​​could have done better. The special effects have no effect whatsoever - except to induce complete disbelief. And the cheesy lines .... I mean why even bother? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give this piece sh * t is the opening scenes. They were actually pretty pretty. And one of the reasons I decided to rent this. The graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic CG of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 not to be able to mark it lower.
