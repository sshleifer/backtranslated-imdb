You know I'm sure the boys sat one day in the office and said, "How can we make more money?" They had made every possible variation of toys they could make with their current characters. So they decide, let's steal the Star Wars idea, A PREQUEL, and we can put together all new characters and sell them as toys. Incidentally, something they did in puppet master 3, but who cares? Still, they choose a time before the first movie when Toulon is still alive, he and the puppets are sitting and a wooden head is rolling on the floor and the puppets want to know if it is a dead family member or something it doesn't matter. Then the story of the puppet master's ancestors begins. It's long, it's boring, no body cares. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is, they tell the origins of these new characters in the movie, but do not trace their fate. SO GUESS What when the revenue from the new toys pays off, they can find new (and 4th straight rats) successors named "PUPPET MASTER 8 THE SEQUEL FOR PREQUEL OF THE DEAD RETROPUP FATS!" hold your breath!
