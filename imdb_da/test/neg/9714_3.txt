The only reason to see this little known Irish movie was the issue, Mike Myers could have played a normal dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good, but unfortunately it was the only good thing I can say about this movie. In the beginning, the film follows the life of twelve-year-old orphaned Mickey, who lives with his brother and sister with their slightly eccentric grandmother. Despite some strong languages, it looks like a family movie, but after a while it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is hardly suitable for young audience drama. And the worst part is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even incredible plot. A prehistoric storyline turns into another, and all the time there is not much meaning in the events on the screen. I suppose when a life drama needs a meteor, or what is more like that, even more ridiculously spiritual, is a really bad sign. The signs are not much better than a story. Despite all his problems, young Mickey is by no means a sympathetic character, but it was clear that we should care about him and even feel strong sympathy with him. It does not work. The same with other characters. They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (though he wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot. At the end of the film, I still had a strong hope that there is something behind all the unlikelyness and absurdity. Unfortunately, although the author of history had such intentions (and it is certain he had) in the movie, they are hidden and almost imperceptible under such a strange script. <br /> <br /> Degree: 3 out of 10. Those of you interested in watching Mike Myers as a drama actor can see Pete's Meteor for that reason, but the rest of the viewers will likely be bitterly disappointed .
