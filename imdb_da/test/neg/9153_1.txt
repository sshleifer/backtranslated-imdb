Who thinks the store here? How could any producer / network consultant / director allow a crew to keep the strangest weakest plastic palms in film history in the sand on a wintery Canadian beach and try to fob it out on us as the tropics? These trees were for real palms, what a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is for real fir. And who lets Dermot Mulroney go in front of the camera with painted gray hair that wouldn't have passed patterns in a high school play? And has none of the geniuses doing quality control of this thing intended to correct the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? Everyone involved in this plodding slug of a "movie" - writer, director, actors - has done not only good but brilliant work elsewhere. Paced too quickly between events and deadly slowly within them with no lasting emotions, except the obvious, exhibited, and crafted - perhaps it only works as one of Lifetime's worst movies because of the whole red hype that it was presented to. And I say this as someone who loves life. What do people give it? All that said, a particular actress is working on a particular critical tour of the movie (and if you've seen it, you know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if it was all the movie. Unfortunately, it was only about five seconds of it.
