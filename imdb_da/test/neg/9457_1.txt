Nothing but the director's juvenile imagination comes to life. This movie is nothing more than an excuse for the instructor / actor to play kissy face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him time of day. The reason is simple, the direction is non-existent, and the film draws while the actor / director / author / narrator tells. Don't be fooled by the 'X' rating, there is no nudity and minimal gore.
