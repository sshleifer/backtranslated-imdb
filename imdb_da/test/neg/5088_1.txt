River Queens sound recordist should have been fired, today and age there is no excuse for bad recording on the set. Mumbling voices were the end result, and the cinematography was at best average. The story had potential, and I'm sorry about the overseas actors who must have known that they were on a turkey shooting while they were filming. It is obvious that the movie suffers from el cheapo budget syndrome, and the scene in which Temuera grows inside the house while a blow rages outside is just too silly for words. <br /> <br /> I have noticed a few shortcuts taken on the Maori protocol side of things, but this was probably due to movie limitations, etc. Overall, I was not impressed with this movie, the Whanganui River has many beautiful spots but this film gives us a cold, dull and claustrophobic picture with none of the beauty. The movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less on the screen's confusion, better sound recording, and more thought had to be put into what movie dealers wanted to see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Hats off to everyone involved, however, to complete what must have been a very difficult shoo. I have the greatest understanding for anyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately I haven't had it here.
