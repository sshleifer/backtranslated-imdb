If I had never seen the first Road House, then I think this movie might get a star more, but it makes it a 3-star movie. For that matter, I was really surprised at the relatively high rating it currently has. <br /> <br /> In fact, I couldn't finish this movie as it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way), it is almost parallel to the original, although the original plot is still referenced. It doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. The play is also weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie yet, but I felt I was watching peoples. Even good actors like Busey do not pull out, probably because of the manuscript or perhaps the awkward editing. The strangest thing is that the film feels like a mid 90's B-movie, but is made in 06. I'm not sure why, but then again it often happens with successors for some reason. The music, the look and the overall feeling remind me of movies you saw ten years ago at Cinemax late in the evening. The strangest of all is that I also expect Ja Rule to come in at some point ... often reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing is love interest girl whose character seems like a total rip off of Lois Lane's character on Smallville, which is also quite annoying. And let's not forget the coolest sounding "southern accents" I've heard since Walk the Line. I'm aware that this is commonplace in movies, but no accent at all would work better than trying to sound like you're from the universal hick spot on television, where anyone from any southern state (or KY and WV) sounds exactly the same. Sure, people in desert cities in AZ sound like people in southeastern states 2000+ miles away. It was thin ten years ago in the B-films where technology came from. Why do authors / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: I really do not recommend this if you are a fan of Road House or if you like good movies. If you haven't seen it yet, don't ruin it by first seeing this version. The original Road House was one of the unintentional classics that people love and see again and again. It was an unexpected success as American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and more recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first!), And Neapolitan Dynamite. Why did they destroy it !!! ??? <br /> <br /> They should never have made a successor to Road House other than a high budget version with the right actors / instructors. Sure, you can never top the original (eg: Bad News Bears, Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right, it will be presentable as is the case with the examples I mentioned . But to make a low budget, off-network, self-production of Road House is a criminal.
