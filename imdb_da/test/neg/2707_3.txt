The laughter is few and far between in this boring movie, and I can only wonder how this mess was ever made in the first place. About the only good thing in this movie is the talent of Griffin Dunne, but his best bet was easily overshadowed by Madonna's unpleasant performance. I was able to sit through this without getting sad, but that's probably the best thing I can say about this hour-waster.
