I give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this child and his friends are doing their investigations as assembled idiots. They assume there are ghosts from the prisoner go, and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experience, they must be narcotic kicks and screams to admit it. But besides that, the show's entire format is incredibly annoying. Although many seem to be scripted, the college educated children who make up the cast can hardly speak English, but still insist on trying to use "big" words that they obviously don't understand. And main researcher Ryan's ridiculously self-explanatory voiceovers make me throw the television through the window. (and he looks rock all the time). In short, this group makes the guys from TAPS at Ghost Hunters look like MIT scientists!
