This movie has every clich√© of any terror or airline crisis film. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely insurmountable, however, thanks to good performances by Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and perhaps Enberg). <br /> <br /> What is very bad though, are computer animations they are trying to pass as live action scenes. Boy, oh boy, CGI scenes in "The Last Starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). The feeling of cheepnis really sends shakes down on your spine. <br /> <br /> A shame it could have been a much better movie with a bit more budget and taste.
