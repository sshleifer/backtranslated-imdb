This may not be the worst movie ever to win the best picture, but it is up there. Well, second thought, it's probably the worst movie ever to win the best picture. Still, you would expect it to be a worthy movie. It actually, but if questionable too. The film contains almost no depth and is just "fun" for "fun" if you want to call it that. In the beginning it is very interesting, but it seems that everything is exaggerated on so many levels. The action was not spectacular to see, but it was quite interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first leading role. I found many of the characters as a tone in the movie annoying after a while. Who I liked a lot was James Stewart as the philosophical clown. He saved the movie for me because he gave it a much needed extra layer. Unfortunately, but after Stewart there wasn't much else. The management of the highly respected Cecil DeMille was not existing to me. I found the film corny at times, and his use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The appearance of the movie was very good at times, but it didn't generate the magic feel that classics should have. The script was actually pretty good considering how low the film was. <br /> <br /> From movies like this, the word "Hollywood Trash" came up. There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw emotions out of the audience and simply no artistic value for the film. Then of course the many holes in the plot all the way through. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. I even had a feeling through this movie that much of what I was looking at was not only an inaccurate depiction of circus life, but the opposite of what it really is. Why this won best picture is beyond me, but it's not like the first or last time Oscars will and has made a mistake.
