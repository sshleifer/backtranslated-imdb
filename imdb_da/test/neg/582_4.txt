Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small town independent "garbage collector" (and inventor of a time controlling machine!) Secretly hips nicht of the city big-shot. After a spear, Lous's girl (Dorothy Provine) runs into a foggy cave - why it's the fog we never learn - and appears like a 30 foot giant. Provine is definitely a good sport, and she doesn't bother trying to look ridiculous (it would be impossible at all), but the actor is really cruel to this character and doesn't just make her a giant, but a sharp harp as well. Give bosses Costello around while creating chaos with the armies being called in, but no fun is done with the transformation. Trumped by "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman" the previous year, the film Lou Costello has in its last bow, but gives little else. The special effects are marginal, while the script needed brighter lines and the direction snappier pacing. * 1/2 from ****
