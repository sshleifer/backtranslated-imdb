This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! I'm wasting my time on this. I saw this movie completely when I took it a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it has no continuity. It feels like he's just shooting scenes and then joining them in some editing software !!! Music is of course good, but the film does not need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role Celina Jaietly has in the movie? Bobby deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel should take some plays, rather than taking his shirts in almost every scene! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> <br /> After watching "300" (movie), I saw Shakalaka Boom Boom you can really imagine what I felt about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood, but please steer and producer, become real, not everything is fantasy!
