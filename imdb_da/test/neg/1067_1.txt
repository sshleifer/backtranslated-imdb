The time I wasted watching this movie, I demand back! I felt sick later, but not because it touched me in any way. It's pretentious and trying to make the audience feel bad for those involved, but I couldn't care less. The characters are funny and stupid. You do not get an explanation of some of the scenes, and it does not leave any thoughts afterwards with your own explanation. All the students in the movie have problems, but since you do not feel like them, you do not believe in their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can't, so I'm stopping now. <br /> <br /> Don't look here.
