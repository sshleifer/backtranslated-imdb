Mainly a biography of a lustful doctor, "Robert Merivel" (Robert Downey), who is heading into the King's palace in the first half of the movie and then helping the shadows in the other half, mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan). The good - fantastic set of decoration (ie the lush king palace) and costuming make this a visual treat. The language is also very pretty. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. <br /> <br /> BAD - After 50-60 minutes, this movie simply becomes too boring. It desperately needed to get some spark after an hour, but it does the opposite: it pulls again and again. The script certainly needed some badly needed "restoration" should we say? The movie may look good, but it is a long two hours to sit through ..... too long.
