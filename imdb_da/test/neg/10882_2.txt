Clearly, Raw Feed Video is wiser than all of us wasting our money renting this flick! They will make millions of video rentals and their low budget investments will pay off, which will fund "Rest Stop II" (unfortunately). I expect they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars on US to hire the actors, rent the rest and burn a truck and pull a motorcycle along the back of the car for a little plus pay for the technical stuff. That is it. We must all be as clever as these guys, I don't want to beat them to have the genius to promote a stinker for good monetary returns. The premiere of the movie was good and it could have been a really appropriate horror movie, but failed to deliver a clear story line. I'm always looking for a gem from the start-up companies, but I didn't find it here, nor would you. I'm just sorry I wasted $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
