This movie is really bad, there is nothing appealing or worth commenting on in it except for the beautiful settings: Chilean landscape. I know I have to deliver four lines as a comment on this movie, but it's such a bad movie that I can only say that it is actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves money in the movie.
