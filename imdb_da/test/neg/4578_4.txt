This movie defines the word "confused". All the actors stay true to the script. More is a shame because the play is fine, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytical random ideas. The pacing is slowly slow, and the soft focus lens cinematography quickly gets on the nerves. I give it 4 out of 10.
