Lazy writing, poor acting and wood direction lead us to a Canadian-made television movie called HUSH, not to be confused with about eight other films of the same name. Tori Spelling and her doctor hubby move from SanFran to her small hometown, where they run into her old crazy pal who decides she still loves him. She gets pregnant with Tori's baby (don't ask) and starts beating anyone who might get in the way as she plans to reunite with her old flame. The actors playing the old crazy pal and doctor are not worth mentioning as they seem flatter than flat. Tori is not much better, but at least she is something to focus on as the plot winds here and there before reaching a very lame and far too well-known conclusion. Instead, see the HAND, ROCKER POWER.
