One day I thought of myself .... What is the worst thing that can happen today? I answered myself with a simple, "Oh, it already happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on DVD. Well, what is there to say? The budget was not large enough to hire a police uniform, the film cut out sex scenes and death scenes. There is a fun line that I can remember and the play is far worse than the first one. There doesn't seem to be any lighting on the "set" (the forest somewhere) and the killer clown known as Killjoy (which makes Leprechaun look like The Exorcist) is less than spectacular. This time he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and is completely altered as a sign from a crazy, annoying clown to another kind of crazy annoying clown that says "Children" a lot. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a grass blade ... this version of Killjoy lies. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s --- t lies Killjoy 2. It is poorly underestimated. This movie has no redeeming features, except the song at the end of the credits ... which in leas gives a pleasure. Killjoy 2 is not even a movie, as much as an exercise in excitement. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered the worst movie I've ever seen. MINOR SPOILER Let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. A girl is locked in a shed of some sort (perhaps an outhouse?) When Killjoy looks through a hole. He has some small chattering teeth (like those you can buy from Spencer's Gifts) and he does something with them (maybe winning them?!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a horrible line (which cannot be written on IMDB). From what I collect from this scene (not from what is shown in the movie), the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in an interesting but uncertain way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I were the teeth, I would have driven. Drive far from Killjoy so he could never get my hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy we have to endure. Even as a fan of movies, others would say very badly, I think this "movie" could unite humanity and create world peace if it was promised that this movie and everything that reminds us would be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - simply because the creators managed to get the pictures moving.
