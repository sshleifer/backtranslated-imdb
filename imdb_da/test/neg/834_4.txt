Unlike the other spaghetti westerns, these characters are almost meaningful and can be identified to some extent. It still has the yellow gunplay from other spaghetti Westerns. A spaghetti is, by the way, another word for a Western without a plot, no signs you can bother about, and fragrant gunplay that doesn't make a little sense of the era and relies on good music to make the audience feel something. This one is more light hearted, like those made by Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They were also superior to the junk made by Eastwood and others, which sado-masochists make their friends see if they get a chance. It seems that everyone also had fun making the movie. It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned at the movie rental but who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very pleasant. There is a three-way standoff at the end, which is far better than the one that spoofs (The Good the Bad and the Ugly) simply because the characters are at least a little closing and slightly identifiable. Not a good movie, but have some fun for it.
