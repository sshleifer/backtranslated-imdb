"Congo" is based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel, which I thought lacked in Crichton's usual charm, clever characters and strokes. Well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot: Greed is bad, this simple moral story warns. A megalomaniacal C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son into the dangerous African king on a quest for a source of diamonds big enough and clean enough to act as a strong laser communication transmitter (or is it laser weapon?). When the contact is lost with his son and team, his sister-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA operative and computer freak, is sent after them. On her quest, she is accompanied by goat-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researching gorilla researcher (Dylan Walsh) and a contemporary Indiana-Jones type looking for King Solomon's Mines (Tim Curry) After some narrow escapes from superficial missiles and some African wildlife, they all discover that often what we want most turns out to be the source of our downfall. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie were not talented.Dylan Walsh seems like a pathetic crybaby, especially in the end, Ernie Hudson is convincing (is it no wonder he continued to star in television movies?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. only talented actors in this movie had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always funny actor (though in some cases it was livrange by constantly being reminded of his "Rocky Horror Picture" days). br /> This movie also had some other problems items, including horrible direction style, cheesy dialogue and a just boring plot that was utterly hashed with respect to Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Not even Stan Winston's creativity could save this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed with this movie; There was not even a campy quality to redeem with. It was just horrible, cheesy, boring and ridiculous, and it turns out to be one of the worst Crichton book-to-movie productions. <br/> <br /> 2/5 Stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
