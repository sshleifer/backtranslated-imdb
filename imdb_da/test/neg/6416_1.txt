In a word, god-horrible ... too many plot holes .. um, yes ... Who takes their child to dig a dead body in the middle of the night? and what about his wife who steals the skeleton .. who does it? why exactly crumpled shrunk in the neck? and the whole dog's thing .. i really mean! Having Sparrow tell from the beginning has just completely ruined the excitement for me. I think if he tells the story, he has obviously lived to tell it so there is no chance that he will be extinguished. Where's the excitement there? <br /> <br /> Of course, you expect plot holes in a movie like this. But there are so many, I lost history completely because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did wife dig into the body? (Who does it?) Or go into the crazy, spooky asylum alone? and where did all those candles come from? Why does the author have his PO BOX in the freaking book ??? I mean, come on now ... And the book just happens to find the way to bookstore next to the wife's bakery ?? Too comfortable ... Oh and Happy Birthday Skat, here's a book about a serial killer .. What a great gift! The book is like 20 pages long, half of which is blank, and it takes him freaking FOREVER to read it. If he really is obsessed with this book, wouldn't he have read it all in one shot? A bit practical for him to encounter his future wife (wearing a cake!) About 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital. How old did he play? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Was I the only one in the end who rowed for the bus to actually drive the guy down? It's not good when you row the main character to bite it eventually. It seems that this was written by the committee .. I imagine the first draft probably had nothing to do with number 23 ... It seems like they needed a gimmicky hook to act the audience to Believe that there was something supernatural that was happening, as it eventually didn't seem to have anything to do with anything. I mean, I don't expect godfather or anything, but everything about this movie was a total relaxation. Without all the numerology stuff, this movie could actually be ok, instead of some hackneyed Se7en knockoff. Not scary, unintentional fun and otherwise a total snoozer.
