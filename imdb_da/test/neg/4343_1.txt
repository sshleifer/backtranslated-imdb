'This life' is really as bad as it gets. Its draft mercenary, mighty, ruthless, duplicate, superficial characters are thought to reflect on its post-1980s attitude, and I have to admit in this regard that it is a precise creation. Unfortunately, it seems to me nothing to sympathize with or break into, and I regard it as another step towards the television premium phone in fraud; amazingly bad, cheap, reality and 'celebrity' saturated tv; and others cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and indeed much of British society. Sounds Excessive? I don't think it is. In this connection, programs like "This Life" have actually been as influential as they are often called.
