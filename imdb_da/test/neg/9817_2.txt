Preposterous twaddle performed in a confusingly amateurish and eerie way - or perhaps more since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, excitement and much more along with Walter Pidgeon's cattle trials of charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with Fritz Lang's other magnificent mistakes. (I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang but apparently not - they could have been twins.) If you can't predict the end of several time zones, you're not alive. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly waiting for this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed by such gloomy crap (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can wash my mind off by seeing Viaggio in Italy instead of and in the most difficult time). <br /> <br /> Does anyone want a DVD that is used once? (There can be a movie about making this horrible movie and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely.)
