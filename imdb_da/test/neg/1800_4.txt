Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is pretty dark, deep and very deep. I have to say that reading the short story is far better than the movie. The character Kurtz, which John Malcovik played, was completely the wrong actor to do that part. He fits the character of "Of Mouse and Men." The film distributed the man's key parts, which I consider important to get the true message to the story. <br /> <br /> The movie is poorly edited. It shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes. In the novel, it has a very exciting atmosphere, but the film lacks that kind of feeling. In the book there is so much left to the readers' imagination. For example, when Marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the movie. In the short story, Marlow waited a very long time for the riders to come for him to straighten his boat. This was a great source of invalidity in the novel. The movie added several parts that were useless and kind of didn't make sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. That kind of just ruined everything, didn't make me any sense what ever. So my suggestion to you is not to watch the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and get a better interpretation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
