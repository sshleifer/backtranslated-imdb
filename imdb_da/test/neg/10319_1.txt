I saw in 5% of this movie tonight, and you might tell me to watch the whole movie to understand it, but honestly I don't think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is the story of this movie? I saw many people around in a factory and shooting at everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Okay. <br /> <br /> 1) They shoot around the place as if it were Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not a single ball triggered on the metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. Metal vs. metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one was hit by a ballpoint pen. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic Balls? In a scene, a bad guy stands in front of a good guy when another goodman jumps out behind the bad guy and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets leaving his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist, but the good guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) After blowing a man over the wall, the two good people tell each other some jokes, and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft guns. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At some point, the good people cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who in hell cuts a wire just to turn off an alarm?). The lady screams out "Alarm in sector blah blah" and the bad guy boss says "Okay .. this .. is .. not .. a .. drill .. blah blah" in a very, very amateurish way. Ooh, we are hit by terrorists, this is not an exercise, but I have to sound like I'm not giving shit. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First you see the bad guys putting on weapons. For the same reason, the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or the stage scene? You literally see every bad recipient of the same kind of weapon and they are locked and loaded in the same way. The arms dealer comes in the clamp and the bad guy extra no. XX lock and loads. When they started to open fire, you had to see the barrel blinking. Boooring !! 7) Actors or Dummies? One of the supposed goodies throws down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course they are bad in suddenly in the smoke because they are smoke-blind or something so they don't see it coming. They cough and groan as if there was anthrax in the grenade. Then a half-buddy arrives and he can't even cough when he gets into the smoke, he just pushes the other bad guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke is not a fire in anyway. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think yes! A guy slides down a metal tube carrying a Uzi in his right hand, which shoots at someone at his eye level apparently. I'd like to see a guy firing a Uzi with one hand, and I'd like to see him take his hand afterwards. Extra bloody gore root in a B flick kind of way. Small * pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this guy is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, the good guy who is a super-trained green jaw is still in need of emptying his clip into the dead guy. 9) One of these trained soldiers jumps out of his hiding with an empty clip! How stupid can you be? Always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Drilling scenes. Like the barrel flash scenes and lock and read scenes, the film is full of time scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. Cut the action if you go to a B-flip movie, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents on this movie.
