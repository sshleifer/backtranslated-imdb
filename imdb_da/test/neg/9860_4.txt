I was disappointed with this documentary. I thought it would be about the second chess game between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue, the supercomputer, designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player. Kasparov was and still is considered the biggest chess player ever. The film takes us back to 1997, when Kasporov had agreed to have a deal with "deep blue" after beating it one year earlier. But instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. there are excerpts from the game, but not very many. Much of the film centers on Kasporov's paranoid obsession, that the fight was rigged as part of a conspiracy theory, and that he lost the fight unfairly. The film also contains interviews with people who are not interesting in any way. They even chat with the head of the building where the fight took place. who cares? I also found it very dry and slow. Eventually, this film was unsatisfactory. It's just my opinion, of course. If you like conspi racy theories, this movie may interest you. For people who are not in chess or conspiracy theories, this movie would probably have no value. I'm a chess fan and I just stuck it out because of it. I give "Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine" 4/10
