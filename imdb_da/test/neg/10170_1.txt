This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen many movies. The amazing twist movie makes - going from an extremely bad "Alien lifeforms inhabit earth" movie with eerie bad plays, to a movie trying to spread an arch Christian "Day of Judgment is present, seeking Jesus or even burning for eternity in Hell's "burning debt" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes, even religious Christians should be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs be sent out like this, I didn't know what to do with myself When I looked at the horrible spectacle that could have been done by 7-year-olds, simply disgusting, I am not a Christian or very religious, but if I had been, I would no longer be afraid of hell. To be something much, much worse.
