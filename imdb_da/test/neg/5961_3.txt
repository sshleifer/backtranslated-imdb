The back of my DVD describes the plot "El Chucabra": after its capture in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra flies into the city, creating chaos and panic. As they pursue the deadly animal, an animal inspector and scientist Dr Starlina Davide realizes that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan also tracks the unpleasant killer of a mysterious research facility run by the devilish dr. Goodspeed. This dirty horror flick is a bit entertaining if you see it under the influence of alcohol. The scripture is completely silly, the action is wood beyond belief, and the direction is amateurish. Two rubber Chupacabra suits are easily the best of this movie.3 out of 10, and it is very friendly.
