Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but these days are far away. Runteldat shows a man who immediately tries to play the sympathy card to his situation, but takes responsibility for it when he thinks it will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this time in his life he was his best days behind him: his half-fun show was dead in the water after his fellow stars back and to this day he is facing a career of vocal and god horrible action movies. <br /> <br /> You get the impression that this concert movie was not made to give Lawrence's career another boost after his humility, but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by trying to pathetically save what was back in his life and somehow twist it to something to be proud of, a certain moment when he turned out to have earned his fame. Unfortunately, the concert is nothing more than a gruesome Martin who is inconsistently trying to be fun, claiming pathos, and then claiming that he doesn't care about it because of hardcore. The sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment of Lawrence: The way he hits by relying on sad shame laughs makes you want him to just strip down to his underwear on stage, wave a gun around and just restore it all over again. There is no real insight into his performance at all. Like the childish titles, Martin tries to make his ultimate moment of truth his own way and fail miserably. He would have been better off waiting for E! True Hollywood Story instead of running at one stage and making an idiot out for the second time. Maybe it's the scary thing about this concert movie - or rather, career tax - that Martin didn't do I don't think about this. What should this movie be like? Unfortunately, his fame was elusive, he was a glance at the forehead before the underwear event, and now is the only way he can get work, piggybacking Will Smith or a Pixar production. They might as well call this concert 'Tombstone' because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence dies right here on stage, and with that, what could have been an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic side note in history.
