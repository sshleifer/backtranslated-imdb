"The King is alive" is a flawed and distinctive mess of a movie that comes out as a self-indulgent author's excuse to transport a bunch of actors to a God-presumed Namibian desert where he can play big Dogma domos and movies, he is selfish devised, stupid, overwhelmed drama with complete disregard of the real forces of human nature, market complaint, common sense and even good art. In other words, it's a dumbassed flick, and if you don't believe it, your prayer will look at it. Only for filmheads, critics, dilettants and the like. (D)
