Ken Russell instructed this weird (not much) erotic thriller, and if I hadn't known I'd put my life, the director was Brian DePalma. Absolutely all about criticism of suffering screams DePalma, from the giant filmography that is lit a bit too strongly to the domestic history that turns into a stalk and slash, even the title of this scream "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor man, Hitchcock has over the years tried to imitate his own style. Sure, an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been bizarre with a capital B, but at least it would have been a unique movie experience. Stories of prostitutes who lived a dangerous double life and were stalked by a religious lunatic, were a far too common sight of the 1980s video market. Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s. Grass <br /> <br /> The only thing in any real note to the KRIMS OF THE MEMBER is the controversy it caused. I suppose the study was the happiest people to hear this, since no advertising is bad advertising, but in terms of the controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes? There is no one and the only controversy I can think of is that China Blue dominates a policeman with a watchman with a truncheon. Needless to say, he didn't come quiet. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
