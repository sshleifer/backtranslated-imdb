**** Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you made a serious movie with a powerful but aging father with three seemingly ungrateful daughters, with top-quality actors, with great filmography and a beautiful midwestern setting, now where would you go with it? Why should you make a modern tragedy after "King Lear" of course. That was what I expected. It certainly wasn't what I got. What I got was 105 minutes feminist tripe - a long harangue about human inhumanity to woman. Why was there not a decent man in the whole story. <br /> <br /> You see early where this movie can be on the way, but you can't believe anyone would waste all those fine actors and artisans on the trite scenario - you just want them to move on The King Lear theme. But it never happens; And there is the real tragedy if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the panorama of the glorious rural area, the only thing worth seeing in this movie was the wonderful chameleon, British actor Colin Firth, who practices his Midwestern accent. Now there was a treat. <br /> <br /> 3/10
