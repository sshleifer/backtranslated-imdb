Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentary greats out there. Zak Penn is also not good, but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. The guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the line between the two is always clear in his films, some sort of important with a mockumentary. Penn could also take a lesson from The Blair Witch Project. Even though you knew it was a fake documentary that went into you completely bought in the world, the filmmakers created. It seems to the audience as if it is all right, even though you know it, deep down, you see fiction. In other words, fiction was successfully disguised as truth. In fact, so many early audiences looked at it, Sundance and other premier audiences thought it was right. Penn, whose forte by his own recording is screen writing, should probably stick to it. Documentary or documentary filmmaking (and it's hard to tell where to start and the other ends with this movie) is of course not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he is trying to sell as a legitimate documentary about the film of a documentary, a kind of meta-documentary. However, Penn confuses the audience and loses their confidence as he enters Herzog's house before recording the Herzog's film "Enigma of Loch Ness" about the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a movie that was apparently never finished probably due to the of Penn's interference). Although Penn seems to be the director of the movie we see, he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying, "What are the movie staff doing here?" and begin to shine away from them. He also does so on a few other occasions. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, forcing the camera's guy to hide in the shadows to retrieve slices of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a gimmick, but it is never clear, and Penn apparently keeps us in the dark on purpose. This leaves the audience scraping their heads and wondering, "Who's in charge here?" If Penn works against his own movie crew, what kind of world are we part of? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn only seems to get into the fictional world (I think) when the crew has observations of what seems to be the Loch Ness monster. But since the monster is making its first appearance, we have completely abandoned the fictional world that Penn has been trying to create, so it all seems silly and meaningless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating movie and a really missed opportunity because Penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about Penn and his antics instead of the film of a documentary. Penn's presence begins to break through and overshadow everything else in the film. <br /> <br /> Herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he is not acting. We even begin to wonder if he and others on his crew are rejected by Penn, much as the audience is, but you are never sure about it yourself. Penn, in his interviews with the camera, tries to be quirky and inadvertently fun, like the characters interviewed in a Guest mockumentary, but he only manages to be annoying. In a guest film, this effect is hilarious, while this one falls flat because you are never sure what Penn is about. As a result, we, the audience, do not begin to like him as much as the crew apparently does. Apart from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance, out of nowhere, of a beautiful model, thrown in to give the film's spice, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps the only redeeming quality (an unintentional one thereupon) is that it is a good example of why the audience is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of narration, you do a disservice. For that reason alone do I think it would be a good movie to show to film students? kind of a "what not to do" kind of movie. I have nothing against a film told in an unconventional way as long as it is done skillfully, with a thematic base to give it substance. This movie is completely lacking in it. <br /> <br /> I would like to call it a valiant effort on something, but I'm not sure what it is, other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time. <br /> <br /> (As a side note: It looks like bad art always calls itself good. This movie made me think of the book "Picture" by Lillian Ross. Ross followed John Huston around during the recording of "The Red Badge of Courage" and brilliantly documented it to New Yorker, it would really make a great movie. If you want a good example of meta-art, read it.)
