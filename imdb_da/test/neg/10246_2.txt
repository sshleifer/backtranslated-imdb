I have not yet seen STARCRASH (1979) - the infamous Italian Italian taking on STAR WARS (1977) - but it cannot be much worse than this misunderstood piece of junk, which probably says Mel Brooks' so-so SPACEBALLS (1987) is similar to real work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA today is remembered today because of the tragic fate of its leading lady - Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, who was killed by his crazy jealous alien man - before the movie itself had its official premiere ! <br /> <br /> Although Statten (who subsequently made two biopics about her, where she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being stuffed in a chair that apparently runs a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet; In fact, Galaxy is an all-purpose android that also serves the crazy crew of their snacks, gets them all warm under the collar and even scouting for Blue Star (cue choral music) when they land! That said, Statten certainly looks glowing in her white attire, and although her role hardly requires much effort from any actor talent she might possess, it is not even one of them. <br /> <br /> It's still ironic that for a movie that bears her name, she is overshadowed by campy and would be much of her fellow members, especially the annoying captain Cornelius Butt (who gives you the idea of ​​the level of comedy on display here) eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot smoker, saying quotes old chinese and best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hair stranger creature, they keep catching. The fate of the play is a metal-clad non-unit which, however, has the best laughter in the film, when, after hearing the choral music after his every mention of the blue star, exclaims: "What is this s ** t?" There is no point in noting the sci-fi classics who have come across this stink in their ridiculous attempts to falsify the genre as they are not only paralyzed but obvious; amazingly, a chest breathing, but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by the memorable Hollywood veteran Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> For what it is worth, the scenes on the planet they visit (which look more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a cute, sun-like hue, and its inhabitants are "human gourmets" (delicacies at their menu includes Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc.) not to mention a motorcycle gang that serves their own special deity (Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape at the back of it Dare they not shoot at them for fear of hitting their "Lord". God (awful) actually ...
