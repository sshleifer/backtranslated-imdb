Wasn't it for the fact that this came as a 2-DVD set paired with the original American graffiti; It was not for the fact that I have been here in Iraq for months, and at this point will look pretty much something I would have thrown this movie into the garbage after the first ten minutes. This movie was terribly bad on so many levels, I just don't know where to start. Poorly acted, shot, directed, written, scored, edited. My 9-year-old daughter's first film production delays are better than this - and she filmed the dog as a sleeping man. (Come to think of it, I give this piece of film 9 stars. But I'm biased.) If you have the slightest understanding of quality film production, avoid this waste at all costs. No sign in this movie has a single redemption quality saved for the Icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in English. I don't waste any more of my time and describe what a bad movie is.
