Sure, you'll see some boobies, but if that's all you're looking for in a movie, you'll get more mileage from youtube. I just paid a dollar from the redbox because I saw Val Kilmer's name. Bad movement. The plot did not thicken, the dialogue was scary, the signs were undeveloped at best. Someone said cinematography was okay, but don't expect too much. This movie moved very slowly and ended without mercy. Blacklist. I spent a lot of the movie if any event or color scheme of things was symbolic. I really never rewound to find out because nothing was ever explained in the end. No twists. It also left many questions as it turns out, I didn't want to hear the answer. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
