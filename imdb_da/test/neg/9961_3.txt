A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wives out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but feel so angry. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with a wolf's blood. Strange, constant embedding of his dialogue with the notes of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men", has no idea what is going on, only that he sleeps. Victims are beginning to pile up (including a little girl, who modern viewers may find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals). There is a good dialogue about how man should not row with nature (still prevalent today) and play God. Zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are most dubious. And then there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is sympathetic to Strange, but has no idea about her father's actions. Johnny Downs is a reporter who arrives at Zucco's bad side by questioning him, but wins Nagel's heart, creating the usual and always boring romantic plot in classic horror movies. In 77 minutes, it is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror movie from the early 40s (especially one of China who released this) so that romantic history could have been trimmed for cost and to speed up a little. Luckily, Zucco is never hammy; He left it to Bela Lugosi (who always hammered in a delicious theatrical way that gave him the audience) and England's Todd Slaughter. But try not to think of the "Bride of Monster's" laboratory while looking at one Zucco's work, or some of Lugosi's dialogue in the now classic cult movie. "Mad Monster" lacks a cult for more, because it's not nice bad, just have dull pacing of more than a few spots. For PRC and Monogram lovers I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island" higher than this
