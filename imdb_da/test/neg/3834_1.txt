I think it's been two years since I've seen the movie, and until this day it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after watching this movie was that it was made for some tax reason. So after all this time I finally wasted my gut;) And now IMDb says that I have to fill in 10 lines of comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you must enter at least 10 lines in your comment. Please return to the edit window (or use the BACK option if this is not a new window). "<br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say ... <br /> <br /> Sorry for some bad English.
