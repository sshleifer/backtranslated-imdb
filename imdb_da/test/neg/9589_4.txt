Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material to the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol secretly gay? Marry him with an unsuspecting woman to ward off the gossip (and keep him going). Wispy-thin idea has given some energy to the good cast and retro production design, which looks funny to a Shag greeting card. The dialogue is not very smart, and there is some slapstick that goes around in the beginning, which does not work (spitting food, etc.). Nevertheless, when a serious tone comes across the final act, it is handled with great taste - and is much more welcome by the viewer than all the cluttered silliness. Matt Letscher works well as movie hero / manhair Guy Stone, but is his experience here enough to strengthen his character, or would he be right back in the bar next night? The movie doesn't seem to know - or care. Day wants to get rid of a few lines and a carefully written pro-homosexuality - a requirement of tolerance - but he has no other agenda. For the audience who is investing their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow on this thing cannot look more than a prank. * 1/2 from ****
