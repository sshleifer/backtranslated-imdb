At the opposite end of the spectrum of the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, David Hemmings' utterly inferior adventure in the salvation of a World War II aircraft is a valuable cargo. Assets include beautiful New Zealand options, Brian Mays energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases. The bad one, however, far outweighs the good. Donald Pleasence hams like never before; half of his dialogue is almost incomprehensible. George Peppard tries an Australian (I think) accent, so gives it up halfway through. Lesley Ann Warren is on her most annoying. Ken Wahl is well, Ken Wahl. The dialogue is painful to hear, and Hemmings's direction is largely unfortunate. The script is not only obvious but terrible. The wit falls flat, scenes carry no stroke and continuity is largely non-existent. According to the final credits, two men were killed pilots during the film. What a waste.
