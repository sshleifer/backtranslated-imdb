As Ben Elton once observed, nothing goes faster than the style than comedy. Steve Martin's latest offer - 'The Pink Panther 2' - recently opened for bad reviews and gloomy box office grosses, while Mike Myers 'The Love Guru' seems to have won few admirers. <br /> <br /> In 1970, it was Jerry Lewis's turn to feel the pain of rejection (ironically, his character in this movie is experiencing a fun ride when someone uses that word in his presence) when "What Way To the front?" effectively drove him from the big screen for almost a decade. In this second world war comedy, he plays 'Brendan Byers 111', the richest man in the world who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty (and also because he is sad to be successful) but is rejected when he is medically unsuitable. He then decides to start his own privately funded army and recruit other 4-Fs. <br /> <br /> Decked out with ridiculous uniforms similar to those worn by 'International Rescue' in 'Thunderbirds' they are training. Some good visual gags here. When they fire rocket boots, they look good with themselves until they learn that they have just destroyed a Texaco oil station! Brendan wants to learn German, plays a long-playing post called 'Songs To Mein Kampf By'. When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a tired mess room, they are in a sumptuous room with a chandelier. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very fun as "Finkel", Byers' ever-English butler. His best scene is when he challenges a mafia-type gangster to teach City's brigade to kill. The script was not by Jerry himself, but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of a series of episodes of 'The Monkees'. 'Front' often has the appearance of a TV sitcom, and sometimes you almost expect to hear a laugh. <br /> <br /> In the past thirty minutes, when Byers replaces a top Nazi commander, and after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front, it becomes involved in the plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise is nothing in sight!). As the commander, Jerry delivers a performance of such a mind-numbing tenure as to defy the description. He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the "highest male live" bets. It comes as a relief when the final credits are shown. Perhaps the timing was just wrong - spreading a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict raged was not a good idea. Or the public simply had enough of Jerry (the beard probably hasn't helped!). What he needed here was a good producer, someone to take him by and say, "The gag stinks. Throw it out!" "Don't lift the bridge, the lower river" is a masterpiece in comparison to this picture. When the 70s were on their way, the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty Python - fresher, more biting and in Allen's case, several human comedy types replaced Jerry's slapstick brand. It would not be until 1982 that he would do something like a successful comeback - as the astonished talk show hosted by "Jerry Langford" in Martin Scorcese's brilliant 'The King of Comedy'.
