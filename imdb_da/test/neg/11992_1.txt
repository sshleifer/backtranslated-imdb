Mr. "Uwe Fail" strikes again, transformed a classic game into a cheap piece of crap. Bad action; Bad steering Awful adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cry game was great, it's a real FPS game, cool weapons and lots of point and shoot. In the film we had nothing in relation to the game. Well, we had something of "point and shoot" stuff, but ... I don't know how to explain, but if you've ever seen another "Uwe Fail" movie, you'll understand. If you don't believe in me, go to the "petition online" website and make a check for one called "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> The movie made the eyes bleed, somebody has to stop him for once. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
