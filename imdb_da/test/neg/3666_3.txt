Dark Reality is a case like a movie that is slightly diminishing. While the plot and story are good, there is a little too much unnecessary nudity. While I felt the movie was technically well done, the play was spotted, it was just too dark for my mood while I was watching it. IT basically says that there are many missing people out there who will never be found and may be tortured by sick whackos. I feel some information about the prisoners and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some. It came as a snus movie that has just been made for the violent content. If you like to see women beaten, tortured and killed, then that's for you. If you are looking for something a little liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.
