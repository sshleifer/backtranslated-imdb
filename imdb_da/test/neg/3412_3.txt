Having seen the first movie in BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about the site and how disturbed I was when the release date was pushed back. I have seen many Mexican horrors in recent months. Some great ?? The curse of the weeping woman. Some entertaining despite obvious errors ?? The Bloody Apes Nat. And some cheesy ?? Choose any Santo movie. One thing that all these films have in common is that no one can be called "boring". Well, that's not the case with The Aztec Mummy. It's been a while since I last looked at something, so sleeping induced. I didn't hope for or expect a great movie, but at least entertain me! Aztec Mummy takes any situation that may be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repetitive scenes of people who do nothing and then extend those scenes to what falls like eternity. I think that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with just 30 minutes of material. Padding extraordinary! For example, for who has seen the movie, what purpose has The Bat other than bringing a masked wrestler type to the screen and extending the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two films in The Collection are more entertaining than this one.
