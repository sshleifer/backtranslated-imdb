I think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected rage. The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of World War II generation who did not quite understand their children opposite the war, took drugs and listened to Rock and roll. But I think their real anger was that America began her long decline from the heights on which the war left her. "Joe" himself is a low-purely Archie Bunker who ranting at all things that made him angry, lives his life in silent desperation until he stands with Compton, a guy who wants to revenge on the hippies who destroyed his daughter. Honestly, most of the movie looks silly, the signs are worse than a dimensional, they are ridiculous. Peter Boyle was able to do better things.
