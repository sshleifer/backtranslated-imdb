Like another reviewer, I'd really like this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and booster of classical music, but none of us could stand this movie. I wouldn't even call it a movie. A better description can be an overview of a couple of chamber concert pieces. As I recall, the camera never even moved. Rather, I just sat on a tripod for the whole of each piece. The only attempted dramatic effect was at the end of each piece, as the film would cut into trees waving in the wind or small waves patching on a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to use some really great crashed recordings, but the best thing he could find was a few inches high at some nearby lakes and again using a stationary camera. Really pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone could justify judging this movie higher than five. When we went out, my father and I were completely mystified about how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I don't know about any good movie about Bach. The world really needs one, but just because it does not exist, is not a reason to see it. Someone will make one a day. Until then, just continue rewatching _Amadeus_.
