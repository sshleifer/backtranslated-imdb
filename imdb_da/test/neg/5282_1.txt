First of all, I am concerned that there is no choice of a "0" out of 10. <br /> <br /> I was bored tonight, and as I flip through the channels I see Dr. Chopper. As there is nothing else, I decide to watch it and expect it to be just another crazy screaming movie, with a similar plot to Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> The man I was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever looks like it should have won numerous Academy Awards. May I remind you, Cabin Fever contains a scene of a little hick boy making a roundhouse kicking off a porch screaming, "pancakes !!", signs that leave their dying friend in a small cottage for bleeding, and Shawn from Boy Meets The world celebrated with a hole in a girl's thighs. So needless to say was Dr. Chopper a big, smelly bowl-o-crap. It wasn't even fun crap. It reminded me of a horror movie I had to do in the 8th grade, called "The Campout". Except that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before recording), better actors, plot, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to make some laugh at a badly made horror movie, but instead I could only see astonished as I thought to myself: "Was this made of 8th grade?". The play was terrible, the events and the various small subplots were thrown together and did not make sense, and doing and violence was very minimal. I liked how it hurt from a little stiffness, people died instantly, and the only weapons the killer had were small pocket knives ... if you have to make a horror movie, at least give the killer a crazy killing unit. <br /> <br /> What in hell was the point of sorority girls hazing their promises? Good way to bring in some scenes of girls running around in their bra, even if they have no relevance to the story at all. And I have to say my favorite line was when the blonde says to Dr. Chopper: "I want to introduce you to someone .... my inner bitch." Her "inner bitch" then continues to grab a trash can, throw it at Dr. Chopper, miss and set up again in killing the killer. <br /> <br /> Wheww .... it was a long one, but I felt I had to express my feelings about how terribly this "movie" was. I know everyone has their own opinions, but if anyone considers this movie higher than a 2, they must be shot to hell ... seriously.
