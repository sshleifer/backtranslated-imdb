After seeing Avalon (which was decent only because of the very nice digital example) and several animated films written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is amazing), I decided to check out the Oshii cinema trilogy box set. Being the Red Glasses and Stray Dog is related, I want to comment here on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest waste of money I've spent for a while. I first saw Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I'm sorry to say that these movies are probably the most boring two movies I've ever seen. In only approx. 10 minutes in each movie you will see an action between the characters, dressed only in "Panzer Cop" clothes for a few fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very drawn-out scenes filled with dull dialogue in some less than impressive places. I really do not understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the movies themselves leave a lot to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these movies, and certainly not buying the set as I did unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you wonder what I think about the third movie in the Talking Head set, I couldn't even see myself before I cleaned the box from my DVD collection via eBay for a $ 20 loss. If you want cool Japanese live action, check the Return or Ichii Killer or the Zeiram series.
