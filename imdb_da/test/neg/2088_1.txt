This film is bad, yes, but if the producers had used a real KANGAROO, it would have killed the actor it was boxing with. I'm an Australian, and I've seen two seven foot tall men 'Roos fight each other, it's not a beautiful sight, as the object is for one or the other to kill that opponent (this is the way to secure the crew Women) and there are incidents where someone has been kangaroo and wounded or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on TV or movie, it is likely to be female or animated as it is a good idea not to hurt actors (they may be irritated by losing the ability to breathe). There is a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and adorable, it's fake, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 most deadly snakes live here), and most are just ugly (Koalas are as soft as stealing wool). So if you come to Australia be careful !!!
