I was totally misled by the comments on this movie, primarily by someone who said they watched it at a film festival and loved every minute of it. Expected this to be a good piece of mill-American cake style film, I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the camera's work is terrible, I don't think the director knows cameras can move around in scenes rather than being quiet and having the actors move close and far away at their own expense. Second, the landscape! My God I have seen several furniture in a bird nest. The club was completely unconvincing with about 3 extras that danced in the background at all times. The apartments were kids and lacked personality. <br /> <br /> Third, the actors. Wow. The director obviously went to the typical "Reaper" character created, a wimpy main character with a gruff "I don't give a f ** k" sign that takes paw heads. All that the protagonist said and did was a task, so much, it made me win. Overall, the plot, the allegedly great revenge theme, lasted about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and did not seem to have any real relationship with anyone. No sign had any depth for them, they might as well have been cardboard cut outs go past static camera. A really horrible piece, worse than a first year student 2 minutes short of youtube. Advice to the Director? Change your name and deny any affiliation with the movie that is likely to sell a copy of a shipyard sale in Ohio.
