On paper, this film has some chops: a street chamber that overcomes past trauma, rebuilds its life and succeeds when the world would have written it. Great things, everyone loves a happy end. <br /> <br /> In the theater, however, there were some omissions that left the film dead inside. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoon-like in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why should everyone be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie, but when used in this way, it is not only offensive to gay people, it trivializes the lifestyle and the trillion image. If the story works without this cheap trick, it should have been cut. Each character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form: Each had a big mistake and a minor error, each character being good hearted if they succeeded or not, and all one of them had or is in a violent relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact in the movie is that they never let you know that the name "pip" comes from great expectations. They give it to you once, and it should be enough. History shares enough with Dickens classic to make this fact apparent. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie is the story of grandfather and the cassette he leaves for Pip and how Pip, the protagonist, learns to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. Ultimately, Pip confronts with his experiences his dark past and film with his life.
