Solo starts as a team of American soldiers, enters Soth America to blow up a rebel runway. There is a robot called Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human being. Something goes wrong though, and Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians, as Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not fond of, back at base and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be closed and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self-preservation, so decide to flee back to the South American jungles, where Colonel Madden and his men are sent in to resume it ... <br /> <br /> This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & you have to say Solo is horrible. The script by David Corley was based on novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason and is a clich√© after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood and at the cashier's office, so Solo rip-offs like Robocop 1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same attitude and basic history as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotional robot that grows a sense of humanity while he is around people. He does not know at first what a joke is or why a person will look after another, but ultimately he develops emotions and begins to become friends people, says Terminator 2: Doomsday (1991) to me. The character is poor and Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation to hate Solo at all and why he would kill other American soldiers and observe orders to destroy it. You know, I saw this on cable gel last night for free (thank goodness, I didn't spend money on it) and I looked it up in the guide and do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a "dire sci-fi act starring Mario Van Peebels", which, when I think of it, is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words, my TV guide has hit the nail upside down, I think it's a sci-fi action movie, it's certainly stars from Mario Van Peebles, and it's certainly fierce. Enough said right. Director Barba does nothing special here and the action scenes lack any real excitement and the sci-fi elements are virtually none existing except that Solo is a robot. So the military loses Solo & Colonel Madden sent in to resume it right? I'm not funny, but wouldn't the military have introduced a "self-destruction" mechanism within Solo, if that happens? Surely, Solo would at least have had a tracker inside it, so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not funny, but these people can get started with a talking robot soldier, but they're not wise enough to realize that a tracking or self-destruction device might be useful if something went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK combat scenes, but it's really weak stuff really. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks and becomes competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The producers of the Dolph Lundgren action ticket Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo to that movie. The action is bad, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotional robot ... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years before he stared at the stunning Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). <Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flip which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action movies like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator movies. Do not recommend and I will start and pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing movies to watch ...
