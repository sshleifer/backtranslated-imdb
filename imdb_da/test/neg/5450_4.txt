Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented instructor that to see him draw a Brian De Palma (that is to say to Hitchcock), it is almost predictable when he fails to work much excitement within this light mystery. Then Demme works from a play by David Shaber from Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, Demme tries to chord somewhere between Alan J. Pakula's paranoia dramas and Hitchcock's dangling-participle thrillers. Roy Scheider stars as a retired secret agent who takes care of the murder of his wife, who is now busy killing crooks who are out to kill him. Takes off immediately, but the script is full of flimsy threads and any tension quickly dies out. There is a visually stunning climax at Niagra Falls, but Demme gets a little out of his throw and even less out of this bummer of a story. ** from ****
