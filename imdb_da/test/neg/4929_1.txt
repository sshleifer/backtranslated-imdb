The "shuttle" is / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way I could ever imagine. This movie has lost its history if you can call it a story? ... After half an hour. All the next scenes are completely out of proportion. The driver is a kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun knife etc. Even after he had stuck in his leg, he could put her in the box. But what a coincidence that there was a box in the garage. I felt really ill and misled when the movie ended. It could have been so good if the story was much better. In my opinion, a child would also make a better story. And why transport the girl with water and food. I stopped counting the plot holes about half way through. And when the film reached its almost overwhelmingly over-top final, I had completely given up (better say "throw-up"). The worst thing about the Shuttle is actually that it can't be even worse, worse. author / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and give us a decent thriller next time. Think the better he will move to another genre. I keep my fingers crossed. But from now on I will read the commentary on his future film First before you look. A waste of time.
