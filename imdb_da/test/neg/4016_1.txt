An "independent" movie that from the back of the box promises twists, adventures and an emotional adventure we will never forget. This movie also fools us into seeing it by flipping Rachel Lee Cook with a leading role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is going to give you nothing. History continues speechlessly and reveals nothing new or important to keep us interested. All three "disturbed" characters have only small nuclei of hindsight that force us to care. Just as you reach the end, everything about history has changed, and instead of helping the audience catch up, you are without idea, and more importantly, no interest in "why." The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, seems to enter the film without prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. The whole piece resembles a college "art" film designed by a freshman movie student trying to hide the lack of real talent.
