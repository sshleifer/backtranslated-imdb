Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Don't make me wrong, I'm not a Japanese Horror Movie or Horror or Grudge basher. I loved the first and original Ju-On. I feel that much more justice could have been done for this. Aubrey existed only to fill out what was to be "discovered" at the end (as if you have already seen Ju-On before this, you already know the whole movie) all it was really a complete remake of Ju-On, more closely followed than The Grudge. Though everyone might have thought it was coming to America, was a bit interesting, it was expected when the house burning at the end of The Grudge left the 2nd hungry for a new plot. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait for this to come out on DVD, rent it, watch it, and decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good to fall asleep at 2am on the morning film. But overall, I would say a 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed this.
