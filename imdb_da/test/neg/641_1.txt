"Eh-heh eh-heh hey, dude - look at these aliens. They are like - bite people and things! Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" <br /> <br /> This must be among the worst movies continually. It is quite bad for anyone who has a modicum of a brain. Sure you have the payroll reviewers who give glowing reviews and votes high for this abomination, but it's easy to tell who these sales outs are. Their reviews are too good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B movie remedies appeal would be a glowing review! Call this a good movie, talking hands on corporate shills. <br /> <br /> But enough of that. <br /> <br /> This movie had all the bad features a movie can have without being so bad it is fun just to laugh at. The ancient Japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in these 60s movies you could laugh at how badly the rubber monster costume looked. Or laugh at watching the strings keep the spaceships, how the models trembled on the strings and how the flames curved upwards out of the back. These movies made it fun how bad they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) actually seems to think of itself as a good movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects were terrible with today's standards. Beyond horrible. But not as bad as the 60's monster movie thus lacked the comic appeals. The reason and dialogue was as sophomoric as I have ever seen, made even worse by being as predictable as you might expect. I don't even want to point to the plot and logical gaps in this one; It just wouldn't be fair for this pitable plot (plus it would take too long to even get started). Most of the actors were horrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one. The SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the "inexpensive voltage channel" that produces movies for movies without an iota of concept or intelligence in the party. I can only wonder - why bother? <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this tripe. It won't get any worse.
