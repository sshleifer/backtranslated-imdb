The first two Bring It On movies were both quite good in their own ways. The first one was quite serious, the other was successful satirically - and the third chose the usual idiotic low-brow comedy that we always see in the completely brainless teen films that Hollywood comes out of the woodwork. The whole point of this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads that hardly know enough to hold a common conversation and that is the scale of this movie comedy. Ha ha. Does not. <br /> <br /> There is no gap in wisdom in this movie, no theme, no subtitle, nothing for anyone with a half brain to be entertained by (and probably enough I couldn't review it all). If you are the kind of person who is entertained by speed jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
