I understood before I watched this movie that it would be a low budget movie. But even at the low standards, this film does not cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had poor performance, writing, control, sound, music and editing. I expected everything to be bad and that is it. The biggest problem with this movie is that it didn't even do a good job on gut and gore. Most of the "action" is on the screen, and all we see is the after-effects, which look very fake - even by the low budget-gore standards. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for doing so poorly. Peter Jackson made the same low budget 'Bad Taste' at about the same time, and he could somehow make much more compelling gut and do than it was in this movie. <br /> <br /> An almost every level error I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Be aware of that. <br /> <br /> <br />
