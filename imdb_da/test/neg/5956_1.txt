Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me from this attempt, but I had been taught early not to judge a book (or movie) by its cover, so I ignored the book's vile graphics quality and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still picture correctly, then how bad will the moving be later? Yes. They were pretty awful. The actors in this flick appeared completely unaware that they were filmed, as just any expression seemed to work fine, no matter what the situation was, or what they responded to. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can offset the fall of low budget productions. Good dialogue can lead to a poorly funded trial at times. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times, as history was as weak and non-existent as the other required elements of good cinema. There is simply no word for how bad this was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can get the idea from my score of -2.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
