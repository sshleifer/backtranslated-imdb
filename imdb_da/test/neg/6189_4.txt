The atmosphere and droll dialogue do not redeem this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in Casbah in Algiers while police are trying to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls for Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The movie is slow to get started and never goes anywhere. Reminds of Casablanca in some ways, it lacks a somewhat larger theme than the desired man seduces a good woman. It's all talk talk, with endless scenes from Boyer swearing among his idiots and Boyer, waiting for Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I didn't care about Boyer's character for a moment, so the excitement was completely non-existent. The Stock 1930s actors stumble through the muddy plot as Boyers' henchmen - guys who clearly don't belong in Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is Boys wildly exaggerating jealous girlfriend. His stubborn femininity in front of her is not good for any future he may have with Lamarr. Particularly bad is a long sequence in which a stranger is going to tell Boyer how another hand was caught. It sounds exciting ... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticlimatic and seems to be remarkable, for it is not a Hollywood happy ending; It does not prevent it from being juicy.
