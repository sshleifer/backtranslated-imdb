The end of Days starts quite well, Arnie plays a down and out policeman (a very similar character to Riggs in Lethal weapons), and the story resembles a sort of serial killer action thriller that will be great entertainment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, failing to deliver, Arnie is as good as we have come to expect, but as for Gabriel Byrne, I expect him to choose his roles more carefully than this. Thrown like the devil this is probably the weakest depiction of the Dark Lord ever. <br /> <br /> This movie becomes a little too fragile for me, and the ending sequence, except being very weak, is visually one of the worst I have seen in recent years, CGI has been better than this since the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> Simply not good enough. 4/10 (See it if you have too, but don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver)
