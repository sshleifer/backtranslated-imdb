I love exotic science fiction / fantasy movies, but this was very uncomfortable to watch. Suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated organs (living or dead), other cruel scenes, plot holes, dull actions made this a regrettable experience. The basic idea of ​​getting into someone else's mind is not even new to movies or television (An additional Border episode was better to explore this idea). I gave it 4/10 as some special effects were good.
