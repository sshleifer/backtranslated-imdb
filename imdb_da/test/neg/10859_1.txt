I would not recommend it at all. It was like being stuck in the middle of a theater so I couldn't leave and looked at a porn movie (except that they didn't take their clothes away - it was the body language and certainly the language). I must say I was embarrassed. Filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Actors stunk except the two best characters that were beaten (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It struck Kill Bill and the old movie with the two guys running the dessert on their choppers. You know what I mean. blablabla. The film was grainy and only a very low quality. There was no one in the theater that liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
