This may be the hands down worst movie each made that actually took itself seriously. And not because of the play, because I'm an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best just to escape the need for electrocraming treatment after the basic photograph wrapped. Being one of the 57 people who actually saw this movie in theatrical releases, I have to say that I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended, credits rolled, the house lights went on, and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the house went up, people started coming out of their coma to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay, we'll get it, after all, they sure will show the right one movie now. Eventually, after ushers handed out aprons, and we swore a secret operation to never admit we were there, we felt it was safe to leave and pray that we would not be seen from leaving the auditorium. I've seen some really bad movies in my day (I have Cinemax for goodness), but I'm still bitter that I will never be able to restore the two or two hours of my life that I lost looking at Closet Land.
