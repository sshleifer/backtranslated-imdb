"Opposition force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and it was not as good as "the river on the Kwai". Heck, it wasn't even as good as "GI Jane", which is pretty sad. <br /> <br /> The film is about a fundamental ethical problem: In a simulated prison situation, how far can you go before you break the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate a person's torture without actually torturing someone? Can you deliberately cause pain? What about breaking bones? Mock executions? Sexual abuse? Serious blood loss? Real weapons with balls? Death? Somewhere between these is a really unclear line that separates "acceptable" from "horrible". Now, what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to disappear? What could you do? This movie is trying to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". I have a brother who went through the USAF's POW training program. According to him, it was pretty close to the mark technically. <br /> <br /> The movie has a pretty good premise, but it doesn't have a very good story. I wondered if it could be based on a concrete event, but it became quite clear that it was not when the explosions started. They must have changed scriptwriters three quarters in the movie because it takes a real extreme turn and turns into a somewhat pointless shoot-up with many distracting explosions. <br /> <br /> I found it to have a rather unsatisfactory end; Again, kind of pointless. I wonder now what the meaning of it all was - I begin to suspect that there simply wasn't one. It could have been much better with just a little more history to go along with fireworks.
