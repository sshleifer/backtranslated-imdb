This time, the beastmaster (Marc Singer) only returns to a new enemy clan (Wings Hauser), but because of an annoying teenager (Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future, where they then pay tribute. Lots of (lame) fish out of the water jokes follow. You honestly do not follow this rat to the core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to watch. The references and "hipness" date the movie badly (This was made in 1991) and really who will see The Beastmaster in the present? Also note Wings Hauser, who is embarrassed, is easy to be the film's best asset. Songs look awkward, Wuher is annoying, and the entire 1991 snake makes the movie straight. This is easily one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (terrible)
