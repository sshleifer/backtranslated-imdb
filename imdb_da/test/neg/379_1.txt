If you're ever in the mood for a really horrible movie, it would be hard to find something that could even be compared to that. I've spent a lot of time watching many horrible movies just for the sheer joy I get from it, and man, this is one of the worst. This movie was so bad I had to buy the third Beastmaster online. One was not that bad, which is great as it was just for video. This is one of the movies that is hard to understand how it was made in the first place. I think someone really read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made more drafts) and said "Yes, that's it. Here's some money." In fact, they probably just wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, so went with what they had. Oh, terrible. So, if you are a fan of really bad movies, watch it here. It's a true classic, and movies don't get much worse than this. And if it does, let me know.
