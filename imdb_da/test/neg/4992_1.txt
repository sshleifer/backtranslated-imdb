This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Drilling, illogical, horrible. Don't even waste a moment in your life to see this shot! I hope the directors will not make any other movie because this movie bankrupts them. The movie seems to be created in one or two days with some of the directors' friends (if we can use that word for these 2 guys). They only use camera in hand. Many scenes are in the dark and nothing can be seen. Lots of scenes (80% of the movie) are only in conversation. ! There are movies like Vampire vs. Zombies that you can laugh at, but this is simply bad, no purpose to make such movies. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. No more movies!
