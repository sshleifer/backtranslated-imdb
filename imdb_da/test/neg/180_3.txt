This film seems to be an exhibition of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are becoming more and more either with large conglomerates (the American manufacturer, Mondavi, in the case of this movie) or paying animal experts to help them make "the perfect wine" - and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. For some, this is a good thing (especially as few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for an everyday wine) and for others it is terrible as the uniqueness of smaller vineyards disappears. I can really understand both sides' concerns and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business. Well, good and cheaper wine is a good thing, but like what happened to beer (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European malls are almost indistinguishable from US) and mega-stores like Walmart / Asda) takes away much of the uniqueness of "the little guys". So I was absolutely ready and willing to listen to these filmmakers. But with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus, the movie was simply too big a task to see and I lost interest. An 80-90 minute focused film would have been much more effective - especially since the average viewer is not an oenophile (it is a high word for a "wine aficionado"). Positive side, film makers are wise not to do much to talk at all - and just let them on both sides of the problem make the speakers. Plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. But despite choosing a good style with documentary production, the film simply goes on, for too long and ended up making a very boring movie.
