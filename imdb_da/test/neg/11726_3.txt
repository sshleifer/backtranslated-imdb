Terrible in a whole new way, something, but love is likely to be seen by movie buffs - if only as a precautionary measure, showing everything that can go wrong with a "vanity" production. I guess a vanity production as there is no other reason for God's green earth to cast as a talented and not very attractive non-singer / actress like Isabel Gold in the leading ladies role - not yet known as "lookers" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy - except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie. Her song leaves much to be desired, and yet, unbelievably as it is, all the other characters in the film believe she is amazing. There are a few moments here of real charm or humor, but very few. Otherwise, it's a silly, sad failure that jumps from color-to-speech to template-for-wrong numbers. You know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art, and someone says, "My child could do better than that!" Well, it's a movie your or your kids can do better.
