In the only act of commonsense they have ever done, NSW Film & Television Office refused to fund this film. The producers kicked up a big stink and in a flame of advertising their production went to Victoria. Apart from the lost work for technicians, NSW was fortunate not to have been involved ... <br /> <br /> The movie fails at virtually every level. The postmodernism fails, the casting fails (what is the nature of Rose Byrne's character? What 1-dimensional creeping game did the Hugo Weaving channel? What the hell is Pia Miranda's character doing?) And the story is a clich√©d mess against opposites. In fact, the story runs like a played prelude rather than a complete plot line. <br /> <br /> It could have had a chance if "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought out and done. If the casting was quirky, if the style was less serious ... if almost everything was different. <br /> <br /> Apart from the usual expertise in costume, design and filmography (like most Australian films), the movie is just a total mistake. <br /> <br /> On a reported budget of over $ 7 million. "Tender Hook" is a symptom of the Australian film industry's dissatisfaction - the wrong people and the wrong projects are being funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (under $ 2m) or "Cedar Boys" (under $ 1m) and you get the idea. The hard, interesting movies are struggling for funding, and the stupid, overblown, name-tagged projects get the money. <br /> <br /> The funding agencies investing in this deserve to go the same way as Hugo Weaving's character at the end of the movie.
