Out of boredom and great curiosity, I decided to check out this show today as my four-year-old niece loves it. I should have known that it was a show that only four years old liked. The view was pretty poor. <br /> <br /> First of all, it just wasn't fun. The laughter track went out at the most inconvenient times, which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes were fun. The scooter went at a time when one child, the cameraman, said, "I'll polish my lens." How the hell is it fun? Parts of it (like meat drum) that were supposed to be fun were just stupid for anyone over eleven years. Now I have a feeling that four-year-olds are not the target group. But since I have a four-year niece looking at it, this kind of thing worried me while I looked at it: It doesn't show very good behavior. In the episode I watched, Sam shows that she steals Carly's sandwich and pushes her down to the ground, just so Carly can get up and do the same back to her. I didn't want to see my niece act rude. I also don't like the idea of ​​two young girls having a web show where they send out personal information ... If this were right, there would be freaks all over her. <br /> <br /> This show would probably be good and fun for someone who is eleven or younger, but all older than that, just stay away from it. I give these two stars, as I can see how it can be fun for a child.
