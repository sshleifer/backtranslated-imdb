What if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot? I think it would end up a bit like this. I don't think I've ever seen a move was so stable that it slipped from hackneyed (in the beginning) to complete the crap (at the end). I just sat there, because I kept thinking it couldn't get any worse. Well, until the end, "Necrophagus" / "Horror Surgery" was wrong to me. Who would have suspected that a movie with an immortal lizard man, evil grave-robbing cultures and mad scientists threw in for no noticeable reason could suck this badly? One would think that at least there would be some humor value ... but not here.
