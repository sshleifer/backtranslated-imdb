My tolerance of shocky direction was overwhelmed by some of the choices in this could-be-really-good time-waster. <br /> <br /> As the "romantic" intervals were of a kind to take me out of history and into "How-and-why-did-the-movie-maker-do- / that /?" fashion, you need to find something missing in there; restraint and tastefulness, I think. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is a skilled, empathic actor - usually. I think he didn't like the project or the people and it shows. I can't remember anything the other guy did. Can't even see his face. <br /> On the other hand, it doesn't have to be good to be entertaining; some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even brilliant. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie ($ 2.00 at the rental site) against the scriptwriter's guide; I understand he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. Pride, I bet.
