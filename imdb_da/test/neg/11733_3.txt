Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Of course, pretty hard! I was so happy to see this because I loved the original and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. Now I finally see and I was so disappointed. Ok, the shower was more realistic ... that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise it sucked. Vince Vaughn does a horrible job of playing Norman, he's just too close or something. I don't know, it was just awful. Don't see it!
