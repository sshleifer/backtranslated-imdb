The first time I ever felt I should write a review. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide variety of movies. I am reasonably open and can easily enjoy a movie while still saying "yes it was not good but I enjoyed it". I can appreciate the mastery of big movies like The Shaw Shank Redemption, the Godfather and the American History X. I like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy, though the movie may not be that big. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (Bloodsport). I will also try to judge the movie right though I didn't like it. Bylys of Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed, but I can appreciate the plays and stories of the time. I think some people, when going on this site instead of randomly clicking on a review, should take some ideas into consideration. Try judging the movie based on how good it actually was. Don't let your personal bias affect the assessment. Also look at other features you have judged and compare the movie you are reviewing. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was the worst piece of waste I've ever seen. 2 hours in my life where just stolen. The action was horrible across the board. The scenes where chopped at best. But the real disgrace was the story. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B. But after that it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new items, but nothing was explained. Nothing was really sensible, was steward dead, he is alive, he hit by lighting, was it really light, it was foreigners, he is a stranger, etc.. The ending tied nothing together and didn't really answer any questions. The only positive was nobody worried us where just happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What's wrong with some of you? I will admit that the eight of us where so angry at seeing this, we thought "what would do better?" And we decide to tell some of our friends that this movie was good so they had to suffer and watch this movie. What can I say misery loves company. It's really the only reason to look for a 6.5 rating. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your life!
