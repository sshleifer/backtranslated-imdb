(Warning: Some spoilers in advance.) <br /> <br /> What an incredible crappy movie. This makes Iron Eagle 2 look good. The story is as follows: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) is shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to stop him from shooting down an iraqi floating line filled with innocent civilians. Six years later, the holiday returns to revenge. Among other things, he is sitting in a tank, Chasing Banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife over a field. He manages to burn the shells and run the tank at the same time. After getting the tank blown up by a bazooka, he survives miraculously and steals a fighter plane. With that, he shoots down a number of allied warriors before attacking NATO headquarters in an attempt to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An added bonus is that bigger Baxter (who vacation hangs in his office) has put the rank insignia on her right shoulder on the back. Elegant.
