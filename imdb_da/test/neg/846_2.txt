I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came in with his first lines, I thought he was just fun. Cage like an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but the very wrong actor acting is also bad, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very loose, it could have been good, but with other actors and of course with other manuscripts. The camera is great, photography too, but why in the hell did you throw Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz into the role. Don't make me wrong, I don't mind Cage, he has some really good movies, but of course he is not for every role. It is really a pity that the cast was not better off because the story has potential.
