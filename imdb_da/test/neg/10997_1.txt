I saw this on cable. Someone had to lose their jobs to green this to air. Just because a movie is made doesn't mean it should appear! Savage Instinct should appear in ALL movie classes. It's the perfect template for not making a movie. The editing alone is so jumbled, you think it was collected by a team of trained (bad) monkeys traveling across the unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and full. The sound is often not readable. Acting? I can't call anything I saw here that is acting. Reciting? Hmmm. Nor can it be called it. In the opposite? It works. All that is said ... IT'S HILARIEUS! I cannot stress enough that there is no redemption factor in this "movie" beyond the hilarity that is derived from its own incredible invisibility. Fun, in a strictly masochistic manner. See it ... if you dare.
