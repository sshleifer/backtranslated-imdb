It seems that people involved in this movie fill the ballot to increase their ratings. The good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it. I assume it makes me the 19th. I have no interference with the girl and do not know anyone who did and I am an IMDb user for a long time (see my voice records and reviews over the last seven years) so I promise I give honest and impartial opinion. It comes to you from a 30-year-old horror fan who also appeared in a few low-budget flicks. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few interesting video effects, "Frankenstein's Bloody Nightmare" is incoherent, boring and technically flawless without any reason. It was apparently shot on silent stock and the sound then dubbed; most of it sounds like it was recorded with a can and a piece of string, anyway. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. <br /> <br /> I saw this from start to finish and have no idea what the story was or even if there was one. It seems that the director mostly impresses with long paneling of the corners of the table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pill the film out. It would be a problem if you actually developed a plot and made a movie that had some sense of pacing. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. No matter how scenes are shot because they don't add a story. <br/> <br /> Watch this video is an exercise in vain at all levels. No matter what people were working on it writing and trying to influence ratings here on IMDb, it's just bad, boring stuff. <br /> <br /> That's the honest truth. If you are thinking of spending your money or time on this, think again. It is easy to find something better because you do not find much worse. <br /> <br /> And that's the impartial, untrue truth.
