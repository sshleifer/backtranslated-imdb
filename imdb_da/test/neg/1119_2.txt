The only reason to watch this movie is Sung Hi Lee, the amazing model / actress from Korea who plays "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break) in this otherwise crappy movie. <br /> <br /> She gets a pretty significant role in this movie and seems to be doing well, though none of the parts are very interesting or well-written. Even for a National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. I might have laughed once and it was probably just me to be polite. Warning: If you look at this movie, it may be bad for your health in two respects: 1) It's like, totally sucking. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so freaking gorgeous, she can just blow your brains out of the back of the head at first glance. Don't think I didn't warn you ...
