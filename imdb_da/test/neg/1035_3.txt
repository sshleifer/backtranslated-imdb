A frustrating documentary. Louis Kahn's son, who saw only his father during his childhood because he was a member of one of the three separate families his father had created, takes care of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life. It sounds like a good idea for a documentary, but it ends up being flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not just one of the film's main characters â€” he is also director, writer, producer, interviewer, and narrator. Nathaniel works both inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to work well in any of these roles. Further, while he seems like a good enough guy, he doesn't have much screen presence, so the fact that he's the only constant in the movie is wearing. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateur interviewer --- there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement, and the camera cuts to a shot of Nathaniel offering a little more than a blank stare and a kind of scary "uh-huh" as if he is a little panic that he has to come up with something to say in response. At times, I felt embarrassed to see people who might have had really interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) apparently realizing that they were in the hands of an interviewer to trust on them to lead the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's dual role as both a documentary and a lost son seems to do more to hurt the movie than help. It is felt that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, probably because it is not clear from Nathaniel whether he seems to be digging in truth or just want to hear good stories about his Dad - preferably those who want to confirm his hope that his father really used Nathaniel and his mother more than likely. His passive approach as an interviewer can stem directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel runs is his own mother, but these conversations tend to feel a bit like bad teenage drama (aren't you honest, mother?) And don't offer much to help us (or Nathaniel) Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him, what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. An independent instructor could have been away from the material given more reflections on what the interviewers could contribute, and one hopes to cut those parts of the documentary process that just don't work, like the nice segment with the guy who claims to see Kahn die (which made it look as if Nathaniel was just taken in by some loony) or the whole bit of joining Kahn's first cousin who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. by a Kahn building buttonholi ng stranger to tell them his father was the designer. (Ahhh, huh. Thaaat is lovely, Mr. Umm documentary can be too personal. <br /> <br /> As a side, I thought the score written for the movie was amazing! (But one of the weirdest moments in The whole thing for me was that during the trip to the Kimball Art Museum, voice-over Kahn quotes as a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's fifth symphony. The music is played at the same time? Beethoven's NINTH Symphony. A mistake? A miscue? Who knows? me to laugh.) <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect and it is clear that he was an unusual person and had an exciting life story.There is definitely a good documentary to be made about him. One is sympathetic to Nathalie's quest for the father he didn't know, but I'm not sure it's an interesting story, nor does it seem so good in this movie.
