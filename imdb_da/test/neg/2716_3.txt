Tacky, but mildly entertaining early 90s soft core comedy features Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey), as three outer space teens. Xena's parents have gone on holiday for a few days. After some persistent persuasions from his friends, Xena accepts to take her father's spaceship for a ride. The end result? They cease running out of gas in space and crashing on the planet Beta 45, AKA Earth. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) have come to California to be the summer with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez) a beach bar living right on the beach. The three of them meet our three buttocks who have gone away from the crash without a scratch. Uncle Bud is being thrown out of his soon-to-be condemned beach pillow thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley) who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with Bud. She is also a bikini magnate, trying to win a $ 30,000 bikini design contest ... exactly what Bud would need to repair his property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. And it's about it, folks. Knowing that their paper-thin plot was barely enough to maintain a film of their own length, the filmmakers subjected us to the scene after the endless beach parties, featuring plenty of extras that engulf their half-body bodies in the burning sun. Oh, and let's not forget the sexy. There is a lot of it. Before I move on, I have to put this movie into context. It was released in 1993, long before the emergence of such soft core labels as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, more transparent, more explicit films, the soft core films from the 90s certainly look a little mild. When Beach Babes From Beyond first came out in 1993 from Full Moon offshoot Torchlight Entertainment, it was heralded as a debut release of a label that specialized in the "mature audience" type of movie. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular movie genre has gone from a few steaming but short sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after seeing it on its 93rd release, it is safe to say that if the same movie were to be made today, there would be a hell of a lot more weight on sex scenes and less time used on plot and dialogue. As for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to run hot and cold. Our three butts don't waste time getting comfortable with the boys that night. So each pair gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting. They are really not that terrible and are surprisingly graphic in a few places, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry, which takes place behind a trailer. But the one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression and makes you be amazed at the overall intensity seems quite early in the movie. Sally participates in a topless photo shoot with three of his models that make up a pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautifully beautiful, but Nikki Fritz stands out from all the two because of her huge presence. Remember that this point in her career she had not yet achieved the kind of immense popularity that would soon follow. Her bag naked at a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soapy water in a tub and then again when they leave her bath. Going towards the bed against an almost naked pumped up guy in the wait, we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart-shaped rear and perfectly shaped back. It's good that Nikki's back is as muscular as it is by getting a pretty good workout. Nikki spends the next few minutes completely naked with a hunky guy in a number of positions in a scene filmed quite differently from the three other lovemaking scenes. No dark lighting or annoying slow motion here ... just two actors in a huge bed sense sheets and covering who thinks the time to be barely working at all. Nikki's ecstatic body language just proves that getting other actresses seems to enjoy recording sex scenes as much as she does. It's really the only time when Beach Babes From Beyond really delivers. But even without this spectacular scene, I mildly recommend this movie, just for the fact that it is quite visible and never boring no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive throw, many of which will show up in different direct to video features for the rest of the decade. .
