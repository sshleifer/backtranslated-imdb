I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few inconsistencies. The play wasn't that bad, and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as it says, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) The bleeding on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage proved to come from the back of his hand while it was his bones that bleed . <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victims from a very well-lit area? This seemed very stupid to me. I'm not unusually fussy about a movie, but in my humble opinion, this is absolutely NOT recommended by me.
