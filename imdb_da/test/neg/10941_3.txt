Oh my God. I would never have thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance here soon, but here it is. Armed with cluttered plot, horrible editing, stemmed plays and headache-inducing 'style' (sorry, I have no other word for it), Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is, this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete errors now seem a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only Sanctimony is a horrible movie in itself, it also succeeds in the difficult task of tearing off better movies and doing a pathetic work on it. Right from the main titles - nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce them from the Se7 - I was under the impression that something didn't smell right. As soon as the movie started with a series of corny, hip quick cuts would be full of gory images and bombastic colors, I knew where that smell came from. It turns out that two police officers, or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and policeman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating a murder course in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (as a threatening, chilling nickname, uh?) For his working methods, has killed a lot of people. You see, this nut seems to appear after the proverb "see no evil, do not hear evil, speak no evil" and cut eyes, ears and tongues out of his sacrifices. So far, six eyes, six ears and three tongues. In a very ingenious way, Renart and Smith find out that Monkey Killer is likely to kill other three people ... well because he is likely to complete number 666. Then suddenly the movie focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, beautiful businessman with a terrible mood. And this is where the rip-off of American Psycho kicks in. So we follow the lives of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of whom are interesting at least until they finally meet. Along the way, there is a disco, where Renart unnecessarily misses Gerrick unintentionally, and gives us one of the funniest scenes in the latest memory: Renart goes to the back of the disco because ... well, because the script tells us it's a suspicion place; So with a single stroke in the stomach, Renard gets rid of a big guard that blocks the path and the guard is never heard again? Does this scene make another one as completely unrealistic? <br /> <br /> At least after another murder, Gerrick turns in as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. In the typical Basic Instinct mode, Smith gets some dates with the young businessman assuming she might discover her true identity. I do not want to spoil the end, but it is simply an embarrassment; there are contradictions, some plot gaps, problems that are never solved, and especially there is a final scene where a brutal mass murder, which should be shocking and sad, comes as such ridiculously overdone and obscene that I honestly cannot imagine how someone couldn't laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In 87 minutes, Sanctimony really pushes it. You never like a single character, because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is the first time you meet them. You are never drawn into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot units when it is not completely unnecessary and out of place. The play ranges from the average (Van Dien) to just awful (Rubin, and most of the supporting spirit); the music is abysmal generic techno, and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course, like any failure of the genre, we are provided with a little bit of free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
