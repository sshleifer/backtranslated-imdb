I'm not even going to comment on which piece of waste this movie is, as it's already established. But when I saw this with my friends, everyone laughed aloud as the main girl made a Shelley Hack reference under the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the author would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on this reference, we assumed that this film should have been made around her Charlie's Angels in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here, it was made around 1987. You probably couldn't tell about the poor production values. It seems like it was made by a college student for a film class. And under no circumstances would I expect a low-budget trash feast like this would be politically correct, the rednecks in this movie were sure to dismiss gay remarks on each other. Still, I still only rate this as the 2nd worst horror movie ever made, only for "Nail Gun Massacre."
