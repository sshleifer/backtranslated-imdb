Just saw this at the Madison Horror Film Festival and was disappointed. A few shocking, funny moments (fisting the cave Carla, an urinating harpy in Dreamland) and two competing interesting spaces (similar to New Nightmare with faith that brings a mythical character to life and also Lost Highway with a man who lives a fantasy in his head) but had long stretches without movement and incoherent plot development. Just because you use the frame of dreams or a mental moisture state doesn't make Lynchian. You need the convincing visual and eerie performances. Positive things: Dr. Maitland had really comic timing and all the girls were very sweet. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt looked as if they were having fun. And Tom Savini at least looked like he had saved his lines and we couldn't see if he just read the cue card. <br /> <br /> I get the Hammer references, but it seems the director realized that the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughing at what footage he could put together. But they do not work because they are too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone. Condensate this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you can have a surreal clever card, but by feature length you have to skip it. It's not that bad, it's good. It's just so bad, it's boring.
