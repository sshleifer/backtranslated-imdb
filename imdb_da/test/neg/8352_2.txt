Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It's a shame that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s because of mistreatment with the producers, and MacNee probably told it as much as any fan - no one can tell how long the show might have lasted. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement, and her episodes retained virtually every quality and aspect of the Rigg episodes - only Rigg / Macnee chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a falling Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and one that hell is this guy Gambit. The mood was also forced and poor - I only looked at some of the episodes, because that was all I could see, but I think I got the idea. Try so much effort and do it, it's almost impossible to revive an old show like a new format or movie.
