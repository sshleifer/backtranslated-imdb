After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the primary suspect leader is Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). Middle East CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned by his supervisor at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to hold a "safe house" in Amman under surveillance and he connects the security chief of Jordan, Hani Salaam ( Mark Strong). Roger does not reveal the entire operation to Hani and it fails because of Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and he comes close to his family. When Roger discovers another scheme to capture Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) to lure Al-Saleem, he not only threatens Sadiki's security, but also Aisha, who is being kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to provide for the rescue of the nurse. <br /> <br /> "The Body of Lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnic tour through Europe and the Middle East despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. IMDb User Rating indicates that there are many viewers who resemble this type of espionage high-speed film using high technology, satellites and any lack of respect for other nation's sovereignty in the name of oil that does not allow time to think, but it is not my case. It is boring and ridiculous to see the cool Russell Crowe with a cell phone as a family man, while his partner risks his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character performed by Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed and, in my opinion, this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in the Middle East because of its biotype. But the film never explains its relations with the Middle East. Rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of Lies")
