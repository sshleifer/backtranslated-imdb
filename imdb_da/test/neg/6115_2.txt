These writers are trying to recreate the characters they have on "scrubs" in another occupation, but the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or merchant ability not to mention that writing seems poor and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting as leaving the show only lifelines to be two attractive teachers that it hardly keeps it alive. The mood of this show seems to be trying to target an audience with an I.Q. of 40 or less. Another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the "scrubs" show is excellent and this show has to follow it up and leave the viewer in a strange position without knowing whether to cry or just lose hope in new sitcoms all. This is just my opinion, but I think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves more than they already have.
