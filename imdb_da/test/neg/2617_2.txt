Retro puppet master is complete and complete CRAP. Especially the dolls look stupid and crappy. The play was unforgivable, and the story was rancid. This movie goes back to the past when the puppets were first created, not puppet theater. Retro puppet theater is rated PG-13, the first puppet star to be rated PG-13. The movie contains no horror or excitement. The fact that this movie was a puppet movie, the minds, because this episode has no shovels of blood, good acting or any entertainment that the previous films did. Don't watch this movie, don't let it rent, and don't even see it on its TV because this movie is outdated, not violent and totally crappy.2 out of 10. As a puppet master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
