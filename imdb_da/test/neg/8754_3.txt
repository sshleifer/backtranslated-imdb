Hollywood had a long love affair with fake Arabian evenings, but few of these products have been the time trial. The most memorable was Jon Hall, Maria Montez's film, which has since become a camp. This one is filled with double songs, anachronistic snake and slapstick. It is a truly bounteous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and pretty much intolerable today. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects that are almost unnoticed in this day and age, which are primarily trick photography. The only outstanding positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and clarity. Sad to say about the many movies made in this genre, some of them come to Alexander Kordas original Baghdad Thief. However, almost any other Arabic night movie is better than this one. It's a loser.
