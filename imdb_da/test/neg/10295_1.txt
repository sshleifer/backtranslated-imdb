The movie's executive producer is none other than this messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the director's father. I wonder what David's guru, his holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. The hypocrisy here is as contradictory as the film itself. It is a sure effort that Samuel L. Dieteman, Phoenix serial killer and devotees of recreational violence, would have loved every minute of it. I doubt whether many would film this movie into its cinematic craft; at that level it is pretty good. But at a moral level, it's the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I think it's the phoniness of what makes me the most. Morally-numb Generation Xers teaches a craft and a small postmodern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and becomes so involved in the arts and entertainment industry; And here's the result: a movie suffering from human suffering, injustice and carnage, much of which is witness to a nine-year-old who sees his whole family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational violators who eventually drive out into the sunset. <br /> <br /> No more SPOILERS COMING <br /> <br /> For whom are films produced like this? Sadly, sadists will love this - why wouldn't they? But who else? As I mentioned above, there are some really good movie vessels here, but good craftsmanship can be applied to any subject. Why apply it to things like this? The film is also very exciting, but it is not because of the graphics and gravity of the violence; It is exciting because it is orderly and well run. I'm sure Alfred Hitchcock's ghost could explain this much better than I can. <br /> <br /> So what has been set for us here? And above all, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty and even evil place, but shouldn't we disagree when an "artist" makes it his business to rub our faces in it? Or worse yet, keeping it in the faces of the nine-year-olds who somehow end up seeing this home DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people will make sure this movie is not seen by their children. Yes, I know - dream on, bernon ...
