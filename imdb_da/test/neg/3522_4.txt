This movie is so mild! I didn't try to expect anything bigger from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​history is interesting and potential. This could have been so much better. The characters are really simple, no depth at all. It is a shame that formerly talented artists Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen did not improve the already poor figures. The director does not get the viewer emotionally involved at all with this piece. <br /> <br /> And the chase sequence at the end of the movie. It's scary! Why would there be such a stupid and old solution to that situation? It is too much used item with even more horrible way to film it. OH NO!
