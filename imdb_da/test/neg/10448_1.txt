Finally, a film for rival 'El Padrino' and 'Darkness Falls' in the form of pure and complete dullness. This is actually the first movie I've ever given 1 out of 10 on IMDb, and for good reason. For one, the cast is nothing special. It's not usually a problem for me, except that the only sign that is at least interesting or different from the rest is Grand L. Bush's Harrington. Secondly, production estimates an understands TV sci-fi as "Stargate" has more compelling sets, and all the underwater scenes that are NOT handled by the SFX teams are filmed on dry sets of "falling particles" that are not much convincing. This movie is literally 'drydocked'. The worst part, however, is that this movie asks. For the first 45 minutes, I felt like we were walking around and around in circles: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t." "No really." "Bullsh * t." "I don't make it up." "Bullsh * t." "There it is now!" "I didn't see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yup. Bullsh * t." Then it ever fetches so little in about twenty minutes or so. Then we are back to the dialogue round. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that is all this movie has. Character speaking. It is also not a bad thing, except this movie is not very good at it. The dialogue is often constructed and clich√©d, and is not very interesting to listen to. I can't see any point that detracts from the particular effects; This film has worse qualities. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. The action is underpair. The script - oh gentleman, the script - is worse than a scrap of sci-fi television scaring up. It makes you wonder where the budget of this movie is or was. Another horrible, horrible addition to 'Megaloadon' (there are about four) series of movies. Come with Steve Alten, please ...
