Oh, but it's sad. A good actor after the other becomes in regrettable dialogue half-heartedly under what must have been incredible pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can work well when pushed, and David Suchet is a professional of the highest integrity, but they are all cradled as fish in a barrel of watery gin. I swear that Courtney was inebriated, on painkillers or both. <br /> <br /> Was there a good performance at all? Well, David Hood as a junior underground engineer whose buddy was washed away looked like he was taking the matter seriously and was annoying him, it can't be easy when "around their loses" to say, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the manager (if there was one), I do not know what these people were doing in a movie that was this poor (except to pay the bills of course), I can not begin to say how disappointed I am in them. YOU MUST BE OBSERVED BY YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> Any other positive than David Hood's third ... yes London's aerial photographs were largely submerged and the effective artists responsible deserved better than having their fine work marked by such a low story if you want Forgive the phrase, as the few people who see them will do it on a much smaller screen than it would benefit. <br /> <br /> What happens here? Why do British filmmakers try to imitate such characterless, acting, tabloid-level genres as the disaster movie and then make it even worse than the Americans. Gritty realism, character integrity, capturing real feelings in a way that makes you feel it and care ... Family way, spring and port wine, get carter, the long good Friday, trainspotting .... Don't get me wrong I like a bit of escapist hokum. The right "Italian job", Tom Jones adventure; but oh it was coming to this, there was more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
