This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The reason is about a man called Luther, who carries metal prostheses, bites people on his neck and walks around and looks like a chicken without flapping his arms. He also thinks he's a chicken. <br /> <br /> Does bizarre sound right? Well, the more bizarre and strange the person is, the better. The more they do, the better and so on. The movie starts with the board if they want to release this madman from their institution. They mention that he has created some prostheses in the prison, which he used to bite people on his neck. He also clucks like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had a patient like this, there was no way I would release him. <br /> <br /> First, Luther leads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away. Then he sneaks into the back seat of a woman's car, and she drives all the way to her home. <br /> <br /> While at the house, Luther binds the woman to the bed. When the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home, Luther pays homage. <br /> <br /> Later through the movie a policeman comes to the front door and asks about the mother. You can clearly see that the daughter is scared out of her heart and is crying, but the officer continues to ask if everything is fine. She answers that everything is fine. The officer finally arrives in his car and leaves. If I saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared, I would at least get into the house to investigate a little. The end is also stupid. While the woman enters the barn, she begins to cling and gets Luther excited, so he begins to walk around and clap his arms and cling like a madman. She finally shoots him and sits just for a moment before finally cutting it. <br /> <br /> So the credits roll. <br /> <br /> This is one of the STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens at the woman's house! NONE! <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like camp movies, but this one really sadens me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Good idea, bad direction!
