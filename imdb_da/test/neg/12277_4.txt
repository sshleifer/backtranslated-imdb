A CBS radio program titled "We the People" helps find an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (like Karl Braun), a talented surgeon and pool house. He arrives with the beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who "studies" to become a nurse. Moved to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station of burly John Wayne (like John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (like 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Mrs. Gurie is unhappy in the dust bowl and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of romance with Mr. Wayne can change her mindset ... God answers the people's many prayers for rain, but saving the farm town can't be enough. The whole city is advised to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and go out. Coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic. And Gurie teaches her fianc√©, suspected death, is going to claim her as his wife. She feels obliged to accept; but he has a dark secret ... This movie doesn't flatter Wayne that seems far out of his element. Being mated with Gurie, promoted as another Garbo, does not help. They have a cute scene in Waynes car ("Jalopy, an Italian car"). <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
