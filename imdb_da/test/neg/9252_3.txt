'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the smaller novels by Mary Ann Evans who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this boring and very turgid novel years ago, but couldn't finish it. I will review this film version solely on its own merits, as I do not know how faithfully it follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The film's opening credits are printed in an ancient English font that suggests the Middle Ages period, and then it is a very poor choice for a movie with a 19th-century setting. (On the other hand, about halfway through the film, we see a close-up shot of a handwriting announcing an auction. This handwriting is in authentic Victorian fonts and looks very * convincing.) Most of this movie is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of the early 19th century England. The exact location of the film's history has never been published, but - judging by the actors' accents - I'd place it as a place in the Cotswolds, maybe Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The reason what is there involves a mill that changes hands a few times (over a few decades) between two rival families, a wealthy and a working class. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer claiming that James Mason has only a small role in this movie. Mason has the largest and most central role in this drama as scion of the richer family. As it spoiled and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is dark brooding and impetuous. His performance belongs to a better movie: It made me want to see 'Wuthering Heights' recast with Mason as Heathcliff. As this is a story of a generation history (something that George Eliot did much better in 'Middlemarch'), several of the main roles in this film are divided among two actors' pieces: children's actors in the proletour, adults in the main story. The profile of this movie has a very well-written scene in which Tom Tulliver was established as intentional and bullying from an early age and young Philip Wakeham as decent and thoughtful. Through hard work, Philip earned a half-penny: Tom tries to bully it away from him, but is unwilling to take the coin with brute force: he wants Philip to * give it to him. All the children's actors in this movie, male and female, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all the children talk about their dialogue in nice, plump accents, which is quite unlike the actors and actresses who play the same roles as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the material's stubbornness. Unfortunately, none of the later scenes is as good as this prologue. The climax has a crowd of workers in a rainstorm, much better paced and photographed than the previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in the UK) can no longer take this kind of material seriously. At present, almost all British comedians have made a "trouble to mill", "squire" comedy routine, parodying this particular topic, so I had difficulty seeing this movie with a straight face. actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credits (in the old English font) store her first name as 'Marita'. I rate this boring movie 3 points out of 10: a point for James Mason's performance, the early stage with the kids and the authentic Victorian phrase in the auctioneer's handwriting.
