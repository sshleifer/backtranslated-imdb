My question is, what was the worst thing about this movie? Was that the actor? look? script?. Maybe it was a waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and especially Ladd are able to bring extreme tenderness to a role. In this movie, it was hard to tell who the bad guy was. Granted Ladd was playing an undercover good guy, but even in his good guy roles he could be very chilling. Then the net result was a potentially good movie deprived of any sense of conflict.
