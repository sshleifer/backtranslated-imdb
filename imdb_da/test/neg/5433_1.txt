If you can do it through this flick without laughing high on the screen, you are a better movie gamer than I am. Count the logic of lapse, common sense leap and credibility stretching ... betcha needs more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If a movie uses a place that is clearly UCLA and claims it is another university (in this movie is the case: Berkeley), I will lose it.
