The action is good. It is positive out of the way! SOSN is superficial and superficial. Almost all characters are middle class and English. Gay men are depicted as mind-boggling sexual predators for the purpose of using children in their empty lives. This movie can only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and will have less satisfaction from pointing to any landmarks. There is no time to get involved in the characters and have a result, you really don't worry about them, Catherine Tate at the height of her comic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on the screen for about the same time her Nana sketches could not convince, but if she had said "what of ****** freedom" I would have agreed <br /> <br /> I'd rather take a walk in the Park; unintelligent rubbish!
