My Take: The silliest of the AIRPORT films, and probably one of the worst 70 disaster movies. As if painting the franchise with it all, the producers of this third successor to the AIRPORT were throwing in several actions, silly subplots, free star games and goofier elements. In its attempt to be the biggest AIRPORT yet, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst yet, and probably one of the worst disaster movies from the 1970s. With its poor box office results, it is no wonder that the genre has exceeded its welcome. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a rather catchy score by Lalo Schifrin backed up by some impressive shots of titular aircraft in its former glory (the same plane used in this movie would be involved in a crash in July 2000). ). But then the credits are showing and we get a glimpse of the "all-star" support, which does not consist of more faded Hollywood stars, television actors and non-popular B actors. The reason is tougher than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, now pilot of Concorde (co piloted by co-pilot Alain Delon) on his way to France after the Summer Olympics. On board is journalist Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who has just discovered that his girlfriend, the famous weapon producer Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), sells their weapons to terrorists. To prevent her from revealing the news to the world, Harrison sends her most advanced missiles and best saboteurs to prevent Concorde from landing. <br /> <br /> Shocks / subplots are stupid than ever, even more sillies than an alcoholic Myrna Loy or a singing. We have Cicely Tyson carrying a living human heart in a cooler (!), Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character does not go deeper than that), J.J. Walker aa pot-smoking saxophonist (probably the most annoying character in the movie) married Eddie Albert with the "old" wife Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as a Russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (much to the sour eye of the coach Mercedes McCambidge). Plus the movie comes much closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever with the silliest cameos of Charo (and her pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Camp buffs will undoubtedly get a real kick-in-the-ball in this stupid post in a long load of 70's disaster films. This is a true disaster for more than a word. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of 5.
