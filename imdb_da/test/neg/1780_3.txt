Some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some marines and the researchers responsible for the scorpion project go under to retrieve their cargo. After finding 200 dead bodies, the marine commander tells the doctor "I need to know if there is anything down there that could be a danger to my men". Uh, give ... do you think? She refuses to tell him what's going on, citing "need to know". Yup, it beautifully breaks it up. One of the researchers apparently is a kind of idiot savant - really heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. He has the task of fixing the lights. He finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire and screams like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then he takes a hammer and smashes the control panel, causing all the lights on the submarine to start working. <br /> <br /> And then it goes. Apparently this was made in Sweden; I'm not sure if the Swedes have a really strange sense of humor, or if they are just really horrible filmmakers. I tend to believe they are horrible filmmakers. If you guessed that there is a huge explosion at the end of this thing, sorry, but it is necessary that I cannot tell you. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely have to watch a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest Tail Sting, a cheesy and fun movie about a scorpion on a plane, or Bugs, a straight descent B movie about scorpions in a tunnel. Look at this movie as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's wise, it's hard to just shut it down because of the sheer lunacy of it, but it's all about it.
