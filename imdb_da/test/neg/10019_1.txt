This is really, without exaggeration, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know it came out in the 80s after a trend started by "Friday the 13th". "The Prey" copies the aforementioned film into many aspects. The forest setting, the killer, stupid teenagers, gore etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Prey" is as bad as you might expect. I didn't even remember if it wasn't random. <br /> <br /> Now, the killer is human, so don't expect a supernatural killer like Jason. Situations dull boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. It just doesn't seem like a slasher flick. The action is simply angry. The result is terrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80s tunes?! I don't even want to mention the technical aspects of the movie, because believe me, it looks like it costs only $ 20. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to say. Thank goodness it seems to have disappeared from the earth.
