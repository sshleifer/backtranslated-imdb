"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981, under the height of Slasher Film Craze. Earlier this year fans were exposed to flicks such as "My Bloody Valentine", "Just Before Dawn", "Friday the 13th Part 2" and "The Burning" and the theaters still expect flicks like "Halloween II", "The Prowler" and "Happy Birthday to Me". I've seen all these movies, and out of all the popular 1981 squash's "Graduation Day" is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What "Graduation Day" represents an exercise in poor, low-budget film production with poor acting, poor writing, meaningless characters, meaningless scenes, unnecessary nudity, cheesy dialogue, and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well . And who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the movie (the opening scene is only rivaled by the music playing during a chase scene). But when you rent a movie like this one must be aware that these details will be in this movie. So why isn't "Graduation Day" considered a classic like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "A nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom Night"? Why are fans still looking for these movies, but ignore them without care? <br /> <br /> Where slasher movies are to succeed across all other areas is pacing. There is nothing worse than a slow slasher, and "Graduation Day" moves quite slowly. The most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up; There are many pointless signs that are introduced and never allowed to be suspected of murder or victim. There is a scary teacher, a stressed principal, a cunning secretary, a drowsy school guard, a clueless detective, an alcoholic father, a thoughtless grandmother, and a mother of a former victim who still mourns. All these signs could have a motive to kill or a reason to be killed, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story still focuses on them, and sometimes whole scenes just refer to educating their character. But for what? What amazes me about "Graduation Day" and its little fan base is that people are no more amazed at death scenes. Fans get crazy for death scenes like the raft massacre in "The Burning", the washing machine's death in "My Bloody Valentine", Kabob death in "Happy Birthday to Me", the upside down death in "Friday the 13th Part 3" and hot tub death in "Halloween II ", and even car hood hood dead in" Madman ". But where is the respect for some truly unique (though cheesy) deaths in "Graduation Day". A victim becomes impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword, while another gets the sword thrown at them like a spear. The best death includes spikes during a landing mat. Why aren't these deaths famous among the genre as deaths in more popular slasher movies? <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day" is trying hard to be a great and unique movie, but there is only one element of logic and pacing that really destroys the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try to check "Don't go in the woods ... Alone") and there's a little excitement, plus it just delivers what fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia), but "Graduation Day" will not be remembered as one of the greatest slasher films ever made. It's not a budget issue - almost all slashers have a low budget - but it's a matter of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. It's all kind of movie making is ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. General horror fans can get a little bored, and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should remove it. It's not the worst slasher movie ever made, but it's far from being the best.
