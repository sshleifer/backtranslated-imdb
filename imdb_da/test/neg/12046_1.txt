I went to watch this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed about it was when Robin Williams crashed into the car at the bottom of the hill and the end when he seems to be killed. Glenn Close was uncomfortable and she didn't seem to be old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garps would have had her children taken by the department for children and families. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his glazed donut look benign goodness are just too sweet and smarmy for me. He has two roles he can play: Fun person or sad, tragic, kindhearted victim. See Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and all his so-called "dramatic" roles. It's always the same performance. Put them all together in a long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember Fatal Attraction? Want an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you find any sparks between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warm up a screen ?? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. This was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least fun. Garp is made for all the people who love watching movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claiming it is beautiful and deep.
