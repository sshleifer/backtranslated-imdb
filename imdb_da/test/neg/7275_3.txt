Flip through the TV and see that the secret life was on; gave George Duran a shot at being the host. I know Jim O'Connor was very energetic and no one could be as much as him, but George was boring. He really didn't seem to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotone, did not get involved with the guests. It looked like he was interviewing guests at Unwrapped, and he just happened to be in the shot. I don't know if George will host this show better, I doubt it because he has been hosting his own show now. The view seemed to pack more info in, but only because we saw less of the host. The formula for this show was very delicate and I fear that it has now been disturbed for good.
