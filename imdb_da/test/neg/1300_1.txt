It was derived from a previous poster that the military would not be subject to police in a disaster as depicted in the film. In fact, the military role would be to provide assistance to civilian authorities when requested. Civilian authorities will retain priority. In practice, the Army would have 48 hours to mobilize itself, where there is not much Army presence in London, especially with current overseas commitments. Even then, they would be dependent on calling TA. <br /> <br /> As far as COBRA is concerned, we got the impression that it was a complete state emergency department itself - even referring to a Met Police Police Cobra Division. In fact, COBRA stands for the Office Briefing Room "A". It's just the room where the PM or DPM meets their advisors to discuss the current emergency!
