I was hoping that this show was something realistic. It struck me as just another mainstream show after I saw it. I have not felt the signs at all, is this America's glamorous idea of ​​how terrorism works? The protagonist does not seem like a fundamentalist at all, and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my understanding. None of the other terrorists managed to become genuine. One of the members, a blond American white boy, would never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a French ex-skinhead, does not quite fit an Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, the terrorists have sexual relations with white American housewives, which I find very strange. This is just another stupidly misleading American television show. It's about as realistic as Prison Break.
