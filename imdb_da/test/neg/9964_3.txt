A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfecting wolf blood into a gentle, quiet but very large gardener to prove a hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages, and the scientist tries to use him to recover his credentials, but is rejected by his former colleagues to manipulate nature. The island dr. Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all mingled in a terribly dated, goofy moral play. <br /> <br /> Although the subject is in pedant and unoriginal at best, this movie is not too badly made and interesting to see as a horror movie representative makes his time. Like most crazy research films, this is a faint warning against fooling around with Mother Nature. It does not have Frankenstein's power or intellectual challenges, but it never extends to any degree. The play is acceptable as it is cinematography, and the film moves together on an entertaining clip. Some of the dialogue is completely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and a B minus one in there. There are also a few fine shots of a wolf, and a smash of humor thrown in to prevent the movie from appearing to be too serious - always a plus for this genre.
