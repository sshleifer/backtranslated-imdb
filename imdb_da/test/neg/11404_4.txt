From 2002, the Dutch cinema was finally improved again. This movie is still part and a school book example of the bad period with Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily told in flashback style. All the "current" sequences in France are completely redundant and do not add to the story, emotion or power. For some reason, European filmmakers find it necessary to tell the story not chronologically. I never understood why or what appeal it is. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not exactly the largest. It is not always clear where the film is trying to go and what it is trying to tell. The story of a young inexperienced boy who falls in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic, sounds good enough on paper and even shows some parallels with Paul Verhoeven's "Turkish fruit", which this film was often compared to until before and at the time of its release. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the imaginative performances of the actors. The way the story is told makes the film far from always interesting or convincing. I lost interest in this movie in about 40 minutes through the movie. <br /> <br /> At the time this movie was made, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were promising rising stars with great potential and ambitions, but both of their careers have largely dried up now. Angela Schijf seems to give the family more attention than her career (that's not a bad thing of course), while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never got any more than playing some small parts in 2 Renny Harlin flops. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It is not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has the right look, but his English is just not good enough to say the least. Just listen to him who speaks English at the beginning of this movie and you understand what I mean. They are really not bad actors, but for some reason it is not shown in this movie. This is probably due to the poor dialogue. I liked Beau van Erven Dorens. He has been criticized a lot, but his acting seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. <br /> <br /> It is by no means one of the worst movies ever made, but it is not exactly one I would recommend either. Poor and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
