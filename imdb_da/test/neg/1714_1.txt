This movie (even calling a movie is an overstatement) is ridiculously horrible. Usually a big fan of Eric Roberts in the "B" list movie, makes this tragedy of a flick me questioning his real B-list clout! And Charlie, please go back and hope for a Diagnosis Murder Growth rather than this ..... You can't blame the nameless eye light (uhhum ... beauty competitor) for joining this weak movie, but you're a former TV star man! Pull yourself together. Don't even get me started on Stuart Pankin. For all that good Stuart, you should have seen it wasn't necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to deprive someone of investing in this image (money or time). Really, this was no parody or spoof movie, even though it is trying on a 2nd grade level. Mostly it is bad to write and act and camera work and editing and .... well poor everything. I saw it because I read an article in some power about Agent MJ's engagement and my interest was peaked because of the trial in which he was involved. I now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders in the movie is because, as in the trial, he was wearing the pajamas and hardly lucid (wait a second, is he ever considered clear-cut). And Agent MJ? Is it the best they could bring to a name for his character? Sheez. What a scary piece of originality! Or maybe it should be fun? Putting Marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first, but exaggerated and annoying after all, said and done. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the grief of seeing ...... don't say I didn't do it t warn you.
