Well Wright may have made a greedy depiction of life around 1800 - as he repeatedly and silently continues because of when it was written in contrast to published - but it is HANS not Austen's and should not claim to be an adaptation. Mrs. Bennett looks like a rural man. This is a spoiled woman - they have waiters (remember the book scene with the waiter dressing her hair, etc.)? But Wright depicts her with hard red skin all over her chest, red hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs walk through! If he wants a slut, he'll try Tess. <br /> <br /> Bennett - The scripture makes too cozy and modern and ignores the weakness of him. The scene where he stops Mary must make you hug - don't pass in seconds. If it doesn't - don't include it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in the section and seems to be doing some sort of Pride by speaking. The first suggestion looks like a nervous schoolgirl rather than a man overcoming his pride in making a proposal under his station. Most of his lines he could as well read a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is terrible. Across the top with excessive screams and jumps. In fact, Knightley Elizabeth plays more like the giggling inane character Lydia is actually in the book, at times. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Half of the time Knightley is obviously mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy is. And in her role you see Wright's big mistake - there is nothing premature. <br /> <br /> From the first meeting with Darcy, she obviously wants him. When he commented on Bingley about women's attractiveness in the hall, she initially looks - not shocked and frightened. The latter should create the front page of things. And when she and 'caroline' jump around in the living room, she comes across as a tease, obviously over him. And by practically cutting out Wickham, you won't get Elizabeth invested enough there to create the damaging aspects that fall out of that relationship. And apparently, Caroline is not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily walks into Jones's bedroom. And and - Wright boasts how big he is with period, whatever he wants. But a couple of rural panoramic pictures (showing Hardy's preference) do not apologize to him for the sharp blunders everywhere. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer - who clearly wants prices - should have been reined in. He tied between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't Tess's last shot / light? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with uncoated shirt was just stupid. But most importantly - when you walk between the two very different landscapes, they forget the most important - Austen. (She would have laughed aloud at Elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through to picturesque stupidity, wet Darcy nonsense). I admit that I found it impossible to watch the movie without using the book as context I was willing to give it some space as it was to give the story in a short time. But to forget half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy to constantly look more constipated than prideful, it made it almost opaque. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performance (since Knightley wasn't about to gurgle or jump over or both and only calm down a couple of times to indicate she has some promise - but faffing about swings to Conveying emotions is not a substitute for a bad script and poor direction - although for some it was simply a case of bad script. <br /> <br /> Tom Holland alone would escape censorship. As he toned down the comic aspects of Collins, he appeared in a very interesting approach. Dench does great things she can do in her sleep, whether here or in Oscar Wilde - but it should be Lady Catherine De Bourgh, not Lady Bracknell. She was just too healthy. <br /> <br /> The shortened length could have been handled by a competent scriptwriter, surely? Not characters fill the gaps of history and help the audience everywhere. Elizabeth couldn't have gotten on the Â£ 10k figure. And while they wanted to cut back on her learning of Darcy's commitment to Wickham's marriage, the lines didn't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of scary show in the play. It's really awful things. Anyone who judges it, says it works well in connection with the book, is a person I honestly do not believe, has read or understood the characterization of the case. Wright seems to think his characters are not the 1709s of their behavior in the 1990s. I am not convinced that he has read the book - he certainly does not understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's acerbic white or touch sensitivity - he certainly made a boring plodding movie out of it. <br /> <br /> What was possibly worse was the sad, pathetic need of chick little lovers to need 'I love you, I love you' everywhere so they can sigh and get out of it. The fact that it does not fit in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone reviewing it as a movie alone? Well, harder for me, unless I wanted to notice the poor actors, the weak Darcy, and the gobbling that is running out of annoyance with everything. If you want to adapt, you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and the key motives, then you will not offend the book by taking the title.
