I am rarely motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was so uninspired that I felt the need to warn others how bad this TV mini series is. Here are a few thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: They came across as they were in a Saturday Night Live Shit, who was funny about how Indians talked. When McMurtry writes dialogue in his novels, it reads so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: Looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke Series. Action is ok, and the manuscript of Robert Duvals McCrae is on, but the look is pure comedy story. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe you can use some dirt or sweat next time. Have you ever been to Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I promise you women didn't look like it. Do you think they have never seen any episodes of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisa Pease: Once again, when they are in the governor's office, it feels like a Saturday Night Live Skit, and dirty bombs. <br /> <br /> Woodrow Call: Call is the most sensible character, of course, he speaks so little how can you screw it up? But what about it? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that he's not even a little scary. They should have made Javier Bardem play that part. Rangers: Right out of "O Brother where you are," I expected George Cloony to ride up and they had to break into a song. br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too early because the miniseries aren't finished, but I doubt I will see more of it in any way. I would not expect anyone to duplicate the enchanting feeling of Lonesome Dove, but I see it here, and it looks like they have nothing for the old west at all.
