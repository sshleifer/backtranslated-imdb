Okay, the only reason I saw this movie is because Krista Allen is in it. When I admit to seeing days in our lives ... I know her as Billie. Oh, maybe there will be a reason to watch this movie ... it would be the soft pornographic area. They seem to excel at it. And a little bit different. I hope someone renting / buying this movie only rented it for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rented it for something else, say quality television, they can die from a heart attack. This movie involves a little imagination at all. Although I have a good laugh for it's stupidity, and maybe I'll buy it myself, I'm just a fool. Rent before you buy at this. 2 out of 10. (Note that I haven't yet given a movie a 1 star. The sensual scene alone gave itself up from a 1. If they didn't have a straight 1 in the pot and I want a refund, if it had nothing.)
