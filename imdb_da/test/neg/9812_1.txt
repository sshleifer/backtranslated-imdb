Hilariously inept - like "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon" that was restored by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Front Spoilers: Despite the title and the big bodycount, "Slaughter Trail" is actually a musical with Injun matches instead of dancing numbers. <br /> <br /> If you had ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a B movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions can only have been bad in thought, such as. Shooting in the short-lived Cinecolor process, resulting in faces that changed shade within the same shot. But there was certainly some eerie skimping on the film's main setting, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a Norman castle. Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote "The Bare Necessities" to Disney's "The Jungle Book", delivers a score full of original dinies that would have been wonderful for a comic, but fitting western action as a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. A song tells how "horse heads pound, and their melody sounds like the hoof serenade" ... under a mortal scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs tell historic shot by shot, introduce characters, describe their mood and movements - as they happen on the screen - and even stop advertising the Cinecolor process (!) <br /> <br /> The script sends giant Navajos at Warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band with a forbidden trio. At the end of the film, it looks like a hundred Navajos and cavalry have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters that die over and over again.) But the boss is happy when he sees that the trio of badguys has become beaten. As the singer helps to inform those of us who were not aware, Navajos is riding away, their battle is called off. The cavalry captain, surrounded by his fallen comrades, sounds bitterly over his appreciation. <br /> <br /> The direction most beneficial is referred to as wood or more to the point Wood. Navajos are consistently shot by their horses in pairs - never just one. Almost all red men on foot die by throwing their hands in the air and smothering. The movie also uses the most cautious stuntmen in Hollywood who hook before releasing a one-story saw (and still not cutting the landing) or turning around looking behind them as they slip, "dead" into a rocky slope. <br /> <br /> Star is Brian Donlevy who deserves an Oscar not to blush. After the endless last battle scene - "climax" is hardly the word - he scans a list of the dozens of his soldiers killed and shrugged: "It could have been much worse." Trooper Andy Devine gets to sing and robs / killer Gig Young laughs at Andy's attack ... leading to a character held by masked bandits to rat Gig: "I would know to laugh everywhere!" <br /> <br /> And for anyone to forget just what an unpleasant job Howard Hughes could be, remember that as head of RKO, Hughes was first in line to blacklist original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC condemned him. It would take Hughes another six years to finish running the once famous studio in the ground, but it didn't help things when he insisted on rebuilding Da Silvas every scene for this movie, which replaces Donlevy. <br /> <br /> It was almost a decade before Da Silva could work in Hollywood again. But all in all, to get him out of the "Slaughter Trail", he should have sent Hughes a thank you note.
