This could have been a good movie if several things were explained. Too many plot holes to find this comfortable. The end is especially from the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper come back to Dundee so fast and Dundee pops up in the house in two minutes? The way out of wack here. How did Anna get the money? No explanation at all. If Pete policeman knew Lancaster was in danger, why didn't he have a policeman at the door of the hospital. This and many more questions remain. Too bad because the premise was there, just bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> Good cast is wasted here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad? Lancaster's character is lacking in development, and Dureya is just like the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> This could be recreated with a coherent story and better writing. Of course it would be much more violent with lots of free sex and everything. The editing would also be jerky, I think, so let's go well enough alone.
