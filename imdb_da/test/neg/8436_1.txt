One of the greatest lessons I have ever had in watching a movie happened this way: <br /> <br /> I worked in Roger Corman's offices as so many other wanabees before and since, I intercentrated and tried to find out how it all worked and how to make me indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in itself asked me to charge a tape. I'm not sure why she would see it. I got the impression that it was a student movie or a show roll, something like that, a kind of phone card. Whatever the reason she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at that time was in the room I was working in, and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the tape. <br /> <br /> Fade in: On the screen sat a figure at a desk against the camera. Behind him was the screen to the left, a door that opened into the room. Towards the farthest wall was a coat house. Another sign entered through the door and began to speak. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned to answer (it's all a take, static camera, there are no pieces of pans or dolly shots. Just a locked camera). The other character turned to hang his coat on the fur stand and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said "I've seen enough." and left the room. <br /> <br /> What she'd seen in the ten seconds of recordings she'd seen was that the director was an idiot. Two-character opening that immediately turned its back on camera lines? No sorry. Next! That's how you got it. Ten seconds. Cook it in the opening shot and you're dead. I was reminded of the moment I saw the opening of this piece of shit. After a very long journey in the jungle, we see several monkeys seemingly throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see the taxi all the way to the terminal. God it is boring! Cut to the inside of the airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something happens! They shake hands. Cut to another angle of the two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the movie have any spatial relationship to each other and the guy has run up. 'Do not cross the line' is one of the basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping side to side on the screen and confusing the audience. The audience doesn't like being confused. Mystified? Confused? Marveled and fascinated? Yes. Audiences love all of them. Confused? No. You lose them. They're going out. 'Don't cross the line' is one of the things they pound in you at the film school, or must. These are basic things. It is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought, "I've seen enough". And off.
