This was a pathetic movie. Alien was decent, but the film itself made a new meaning to the pitiful. The reason is something that has been done over and over again! But this one does the worst! The action was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. No one developed any concern for the protagonist. The movie was too slow, and the murder scenes there were stupidly designed and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie. There are some movies that "suck" but can still be enjoyed because of that total discomfort, but it doesn't even have it !! The one who made this movie thought they could do something good and they failed flawlessly. There is nothing this movie has to offer, except headaches. Avoid it!
