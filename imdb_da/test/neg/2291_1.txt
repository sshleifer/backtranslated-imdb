In fact, I want to have my review be the one word. My friend, whose opinions I almost always trust in movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this, no matter how tempted or boring or desperate to see a new horror movie I was because it was a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, I haven't talked to him for a while, and I was busy choosing a movie and thinking, "What bad, how bad could it be?" Why don't I learn What did I think? Did I think it would be a better movie while sitting on the shelf for years waiting to be rented? <br /> <br /> 'The Plot relates to a guy editing movies for a company. His boss is a jerk. The guy who had worked before him went crazy and blew himself into the pre-credits sequence, so for some reason the boss chose nerdy 'Ed' for the special "Loose Limb" splatter movie editing project. He never says what Ed has to edit, but I don't think it matters. Ed is sorry for some of the clips and works on them in this house all alone that the boss has decided to move him to for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or make another project, but his boss doesn't care. He slowly begins to go insane, apparently to see the rocks, and wants to do the evil murders in real life. Or has he been this way all the time? Be aware that I make this plot sound much deeper, interesting and coherent than it really is. <br /> <br /> We don't care about the signs at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the evil ones. The ground is real, dull and predictable. The splatter is not even so cruel or creative - it is not worth renting just for the sake of doing, because it is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All 'tributes' to Sam Raimi just came out as really bad ripoffs, and no one in the movie is anywhere near good looks like Bruce Campbell, so you can't distract yourself with it. I think an "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is only highlighted on a scene in the hope that Sam Raimi is being flattered and not considering any kind of trial. A trained chimpanzee could have written a better manuscript. Every time I hear lines like "Do we have fun ... yet?" (which even Bride of Re-Animator could not pull off without causing me to twist) I begin to feel like capturing some kind of deadly weapon itself. Characters appear right out of nowhere, without explanation, wandering in only to be killed. This may be OK if the movie was even extremely entertaining or entertaining, but that was all I could do to keep going forward most of the time. Fortunately, I chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook while the movie was playing. Believe in me, it did not require my full attention. I still felt like 90+ minutes in my life were wasted just by having this in the background. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, no matter how tempted you are - you'll hate yourself for wasting your money. Horror fans will be completely hampered by how incompetent it is. Even those who have not seen too many splatter movies should stay away, as there are so many movies out there, you can rent what is much more worthwhile. If you want something brainless, low budget and fun, rent something else. Complete waste of time without redeeming properties at all. Be wiser than I was at that time, and let me not be fooled by the "warning - not too weak heart" on the box. You've been warned! <br /> <br />
