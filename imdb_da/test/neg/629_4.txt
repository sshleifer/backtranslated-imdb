I have seen previous films by Cédric Klapisch and therefore expected a quality film with psychological depth. Having been an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it means to spend time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. Yes, it's fun! Because of that I didn't think I shouldn't miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out that L'Auberge Espagnol does not meet in many ways: the characters are stereotypical, the events are trite and the story is low. Although there are few known situations, they are annoying clichés and do not go beyond the trivial events. This made the movie unattractive to look at, and gave me a strong "made-it-not-you-have-something-to-add?" feeling. Apart from that, the film lacks a fixed story. It sometimes looks more like a documentary or "real life" show than a seriously made movie. <br /> <br /> But I can imagine that if you haven't studied or traveled abroad, it can be fun to see.
