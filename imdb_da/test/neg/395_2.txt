This is one of the movies I watched and wondered why I saw it? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself, I didn't find very realistic. No, I've never used a "many lizards" or have I ever seen or heard about a journey around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar RV. The same thing about a pimp who has never sampled that lady (until the end of the movie and he still didn't ...) and only got 50 bucks 'a cut' when the prostitute gets $ 200.00 (well, $ 150.00 after his cut, yes ...). I still laugh at the tree-tree commentary Ivey made (they are Lot Lizards, they will screw something with 20 bucks, and some are men dressed as a woman ... or something just as weird), which means we are better than them, then we can still be prostitutes, but we are paid better. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, just a story of a young woman who wanted something more from life when a dead job while living at home (she is 18, remember?) and embarrassed that her mother is big seen doing the same thing (dead job). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She hit five tricks on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750.00 she made was worth it? I don't want to guess it.
