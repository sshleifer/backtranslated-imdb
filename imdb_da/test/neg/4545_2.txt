As expected, there is a pretty good reason why this movie is so unclear and unknown, despite the fact that the ever-popular premise for zombies is staring in the 80's B movie queen Linda Blair, namely: it stinks! "The Chilling" is trying tremendously hard? too hard ?? being a story with depth and factual background, whereas it should have been a light-headed and gore-packed horror flick of frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before something far away interesting or important happens. There is a lot of excitement about cryogenics, which I learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So, of course, a lot of people in this movie are studying the behavior of human bodies when they are frozen. Needless to say, this is extremely tedious until two dimmed night watchers decide during an electrical current that it is a good idea to put the metal-constructed cool cells outside in the thunderstorms. The coolers are hit by lightning strikes, of course, and the bodies are spontaneously defrosting and going to live on a murderous zombie ramp. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprising (for a late 80's action at least) gorefree horror movie that doesn't even use a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to build an atmosphere of excitement and annoyance fail tremendously, and I can't think of any reason why the Zombi attacks should be so bloodless. Even in spite of the low budget available, they could have done better. The set pieces, make-up effects and costumes are pitiable. For example, the research laboratory looks like a decent apartment flat, while the zombies couldn't see less threatening with their green faces and foil wrapping clothes. How Linda Blair managed to get involved once again in such an embarrassing low-budget horror flick is a complete mystery. She is attracted to miserable B-movies as bees are to honey.
