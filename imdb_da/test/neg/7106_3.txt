I made the mistake of buying this when I was collecting cartoon-inspired movies. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought there might be some campy fun in it, a "so bad" it gets good mood maybe, I was wrong. I had seen it a long time ago and didn't remember any of it. Now I know why. I was bored with my mind and looked for disturbances to do something else. I'm too grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl doesn't work on any front. The script is bad, you don't care about the characters, and humor is mostly paralyzed except for a few entertaining lineages. The special effects or places are bad or often replaced by cartoons or animations that are just too damaging to live action. It was as if they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and then resort to drawings how cool they could be (an uncensored animated feature would be better for Tank Girl, now I think about it). The scene scenes were cheesy, but not in a fun b-movie way. The idea itself was far from impressive or dynamic, although it was interestingly decorated. In fact, the best action scenes involving the thought were in animation. <br /> <br /> It has some interesting songs by famous artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don't fit most of the time. When they even break into a ridiculous song and dance song that was just meaningless and terrible. I think that is when I am completely set. I suppose Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, sees the trashy punk part besides her "attitude" and sometimes scary funny retorts, are more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst cartoon characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only saving grace of the movie, and it's great how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell wasn't so bad playing his usual heavy. It may be a cult movie for some, but be aware that it is very different from the original independent comics, and the original creators were disappointed with the movie itself (see the post for Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
