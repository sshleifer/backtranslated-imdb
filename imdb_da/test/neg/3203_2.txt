trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this movie falls into two of these. It actually takes place in the room - but it's not fun or scary. The reason is gloomy, and the one joke that relates to the computer's intellect is passed on to death. To say that Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. The homosexual relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is suggested but never explored, while the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so cruel to be ridiculous. All in all, it is a turkey that is best suited for late night television, preferably while ironing.
