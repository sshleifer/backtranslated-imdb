If you are a fan of slap stick that has horrible writing, horrible actor and cliché cliché, this is for you. <br /> <br /> There is far too much to list with the reasons why this movie sucks. In a brief summary, people with a total iq of 100 travel to New Mexico on a run of $ 200 million. And yes, they are all superheroes, as they can do many things like jumping on trains that travel 80+ mph, survive many car accidents and endless instances of direct cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics. <br /> <br /> If you're a teenager or don't want to think about a movie, it's here for you. Not an actor outside Lovitz is convincing at all. Lovitz hides the movie from a 1 with the Hitler bit. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save yourself the 2 hour pain and $ 4)
