I watched this movie when it was first released in 1986. At that time I was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy, ie. Monty Python, Jim Belushi & SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech & Chong, so I think my judgment represents most "sane" individuals. The absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new "My Little Pony" movie that came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was so horrible that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the first week ended. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised someone will waste money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".
