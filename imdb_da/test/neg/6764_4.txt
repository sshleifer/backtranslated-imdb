Some nameless foreigners on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the fighting robot Kronos to rob the world's energy. They have been given a prototype sounding around Mexico for openers, and if he turns out to be successful, more will be sent. It would certainly take a lot of time for this one Kronos to do this task. For reasons I cannot explain to foreigners first catching the mind of leading scientist John Emery, who telepathically directed Kronos to his first goal. When Emery is killed later and the monster seems to work well enough without Emery as controller, why aliens needed him initially, is a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> In any case, researchers Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, working under Emery, are not fooled by his nature. And of course they have come up with a plan to handle the raging metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect movie for the fifties, the evil guys are never seen, they are just out there looking to undermine humanity. It's a perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. The players look as if they have a great old age, which gets so many clich√© lines as the authors could put into the script. I get the impression that Kronos is that kind of movie, Ed Wood might have done on a bigger budget with a little more care.
