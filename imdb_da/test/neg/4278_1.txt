For anyone reading this book, Fanny Price ends with her own woman, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. Le Touzel looks like she's on medication. Terrible act, she just ruins it! Henry is a little high for his character. He's too little. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a little too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical - OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates also look too little. But Le Touzel is simply angry. This is not a good sign for her. Bad Fanny! I would only recommend this movie because it contains an almost complete textual account of the language Austen uses in the short story. The 1999 version is much more fun, but terribly incomplete. If they could restore this version with a better-suited actress for Fanny, it would be great!
