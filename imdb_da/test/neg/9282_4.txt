I saw this movie with great expectations. The blueberry at the back indicated that this would be an unpleasant one. But it was rather tame and somewhat unsatisfactory. The violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (it was probably probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - maybe more), and at no time was I myself feel uneasy, let it be scared. Again, a CAT 3 movie with large wraps is not up to its hype. Sure to rent this movie, but don't go in with any expectations. I'm so eager to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but are constantly disappointed. I loved Ichi and Audition, but then again, Miike stands alone at the moment. <br /> <br /> You must inspire me ..... There is a great cluster of shy fans who are hungry for quality cloud!
