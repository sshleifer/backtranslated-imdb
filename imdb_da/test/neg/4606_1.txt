The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a little girl faces abuse (both emotionally and physically) and tries to handle it and survive. What makes the movie fall apart is the horrible use of voice overs and corny dialogue. The actors must point out the most obvious things over and over again. There is also very boring, almost fun, over-use of metaphors in voice overs. The highlight is the little girl's action. Nice try, but this one is a stinker.
