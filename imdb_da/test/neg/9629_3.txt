So many people loved this movie, but there are a couple of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask unnecessarily uncomfortable to watch and challenging boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps and I will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so uncomfortably. First, to put the plate straight - I like Neil Gaiman's books. I sometimes find his knowledge of sarcastic, "wry asides" humor, a little geeky, and I actually prefer his work when he plays it right and leaves the jokes alone - but even with his occasional lapses in stupid Find his creativity and imagination to be something special. <br /> <br /> Interesting is one of Gaiman's most powerful works, Coraline, a Gothic adventure for children that is very low on jokes and high on tensions and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) exaggerates the funnies, and tends to read at times as Terry Pratchett does the sisters of mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirror mask inhabits the same area to Coraline, and when I saw the amazing visuals in the trailer, I was a little excited that someone had managed to transfer Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen. <br /> <br /> In praise of film, some sequences look great. However, the visual effects are occasionally destroyed by CGI animation that resembles a media science project. Wallpapers and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character animation looks clumsy, amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the animation is beautifully animated, but the book-eating cat cattle look poorly reproduced and very "computer-generated". Compared to the animation standard found in productions like 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask occasionally sees a lot of amateur. But in Mirrormask's defense, the budget was small for such a grand vision, and a few crushers in the effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What can not be forgiven is the stylish, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors are desperately struggling with the dialogue - and there is so much that they are constantly being inhibited and stumbled upon it. The conversation becomes completely unnatural, the jokes fall flat again and again, and the talented speeches seem to be the author's only method of plot display. Combined with the fact that the actors work against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'Phantom Menace') - it makes the movie almost unmatched. In such an unreal setting, the actors must work twice as hard to be believed, and by and large, they fail terribly. The girl who plays the leading role puts in a brave fight against the impossible phase-school dialogue, and occasionally shows true promise, but it is never enough. The god-terrible cod-'Order 'of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend a tremendous amount of screen time) pays any chance this young actress rises above the material. It seems to be Valentine's work to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add a little light relief. Personally, I wouldn't have him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What is annoying (for us Brits, anyway) we know Rob Brydon can shop! We've seen him keep the screen for half an hour alone (make them 'Marion & Geoff' monologues), and in the first 'real world' of the movie he's okay. However, keep him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and becomes the worst am-dram ham I've seen this year. A real shame. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Answer ... the bad slack-busting, sub-Courtney Pine saxing and unlistenable, also-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never closes. God, the music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant, and if that is not enough, the bad slack base has all over it. It makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but it can be a blessing in disguise. What's wrong with that? Answer .... The whistling mime artist. In modern society, there should be no room for mime, except for some secret places in France. At every moment, when the camera lashes on whine, whistle, mash juggling, yoghurt-waving idiot, I understand why the Edinburgh locals get a little nervous and exciting when the festival time comes again. <br /> <br /> My final criticism is that the movie is pretty boring. Surrealism is often boring ?? It either requires the audience to slip into a dreamlike, Zen, accepting state, or for the audience to be constantly wowed by bigger and bigger surprises. A story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and worry about would have been far from giving this movie the emotional center that it unfortunately lacked, while the eyelids were stuck. <br /> <br /> Finally, excuse all those who found depth, meaning and wonder in this movie. You've managed to suspend your disbelief you've seen past the creaky CGI, ignore the crazy dialogue and the unpleasant beliefs that resulted, and understood the maker's great, imaginative vision. I wanted to, but I couldn't look past the real mistakes that struck it down. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman will get it right next time if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.
