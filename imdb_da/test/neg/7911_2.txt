Anyone decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of the airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all his time insulting the intelligence of the audience and cast. <br /> <br /> This movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. If nothing else, it deserves to be remembered to achieve it. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. A really, really bad thing. Picking it apart point-by-point would be a waste of time. The best thing to say about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it. Do yourself a favor ... go and buy a picture of a purple plane, and you will have the best of what this movie had to offer. This one certainly goes under the category "What! ^ @@ & *! Thought the ????"
