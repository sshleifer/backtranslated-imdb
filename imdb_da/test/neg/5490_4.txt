This film needs very well-known land - the confusion of art and reality in the players' lives. It has nothing particularly new or interesting to say on this subject and is actually quite boring. Especially the last scene is interminably boring. Watching the audience cry at the "moving" play they see on the screen prompted me to ask "who do they think they are doing fun?" <br /> <br /> There are nevertheless some good performances and interesting scenes, especially from some of the smaller characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly affected actor who gets a lot of policemen patting his performance when they arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken again plays an over-the-top wacko. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her to bed? He makes an identical twist in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an antique table and poking him with champagne. All in all, this movie was enchanting and annoying, but mostly annoying.
