This is total swelling. If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck everything out of it, and add many twisted, kinky bondage parts, a few rape scenes, and one or two sincere scary scenes, and you will get this movie. People call this a ripoff of '86's The Hitcher, but I can't see it at all. Even the worst Hitcher ripoffs are still better than this. The main problem on the display here is that there really is nothing here besides a couple of the director's fetishes, which are exhibited as circus exhibitions. Is everything you need out of a movie picture of girls being mistreated and tied up, fighting in fear? Well, rent this movie! <br /> <br /> But I'd rather just watch a good movie, which it clearly isn't. The sad thing is that there are some really good tensions waiting to be uncovered here, but few. For example, the excitement of the beginning before bondage nonsense ... began pretty damn good if you ask me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (can't remember names) is chilling, very brutal in a way, challenging even The Devil's Rejects for unbridled rage. How can the rest of the movie not be so good? Huh? I really need to stop renting stupid crap like that. Closing message: Just let this X-ray waste die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
