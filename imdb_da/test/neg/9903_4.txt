I think "Category 6: The Day of Destruction" was very unrealistic. The digital effects are like a children's cartoon. <br /> <br /> Actors did not act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot, she seemed as if she had spit tomato sauce on her. <br /> <br /> The movie was boring, but I saw it because it was on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting sign was Tornado Tommy, he was fun! <br /> <br /> Please keep the special effects real. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: "What did we do to piss-off Mother Nature?" <br /> <br /> I don't know what to write to fill the 10 lines. What more can I say that the movie is so boring, I think my comment is just as boring.
