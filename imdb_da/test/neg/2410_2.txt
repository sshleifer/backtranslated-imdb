I didn't really know what to expect from "Future-Kill", but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than what I got. I knew the rating was poor and the reviews were unfavorable, but the subversive DVD cover illustration looks cool and I can't resist it. For a very long (too long) time, this movie increased the impression of being an unofficial successor to Porky's with lame, vulgar and offensive fraternity feats. Five mega-dorks, one of those reminiscent of a precise young clone of Jim Carrey, will desperately become members of a frat house, but their ultimate initiation may just be a little bit dangerous and dangerous. They have fallen into the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces at the same time as the outbreak of a violent gang war. It does not take long before they are confronted with Splatter, a seemingly half-moon and half-mask warrior who leads a gang where I never really found out who or what they were. Were they a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator imitations from a distant future? Does anyone care? "Future-Kill" is a bizarre amateur file with a scenario that jumps from one topic to another without any logical connection or narrative. The plot lends important elements from amazing movie cult classics such as "The Warriors", "Escape from New York" and "The Terminator", but the end result is a gigantic Sci-Fi monstrosity. Costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and there is a truck of cheap and free nudity. The action is horrible, but I'm willing to blame the retarded dialogues instead of the cast members. One to avoid at all costs, despite really cool DVD cover art. Resist it!
