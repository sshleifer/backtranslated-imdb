I don't mind Paul Schrader at all. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite films. But some horror movie fans were in an early uprising when his original version of EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION; this one you read about right now as it turns out) was beaten by Warners and when Renny Harlin was replaced by fir stuff up and low a new version that was "more scary". In my opinion, some viewers were injured and were automatically hated by Renny Harlin's take on the subject (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first movie film was ever unspoken for them to judge. And I should know; because I myself entered the theatrical premiere of BEGINNING with stubborn arms folded and prepared for the absolute worst that I surely had to come. Imagine my surprise when I found Harlin's BEGINNING much more serious than I could have ever done, with a good performance from Stellan Skarsgard as a young version of Father Merrin who fought with his faith in God. It was not a good movie in any way, but it was not far near the garbage, I had prepared myself in time to look invisible. <br /> <br /> Now I have finally seen the true garbage version - and that's Paul Schrader's DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST. It was relentlessly talky, uninteresting and motionless. Stellan Skarsg√•rd's troubled priest was not as interesting as he had been to me in Harlin's film, and the actor himself was not so good at the part. For all those who pointed out the obvious CGI effects in BEGINNING, guess what? They are also here in DOMINION. Remember the silly ending in Harlin's rendition (which I also agree to destroy the rest of the movie)? Now you must find that this end from Schrader is not a hell of a lot less. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I insult the nonsense that has been presented by those who appreciate this movie better than Harlin by saying that we are "retarder" or "cannot appreciate subtle filmmaking ". As a person who despises Stephen Sommers' MTV fashioned MUMMY of '99 and is a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror films of the 30s and 40s, I can assure you that this is not the case with me. At least there were "some" degrees of terror and exorcist-type goings in Harlin's BEGINNING; This one is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified by insomnia. It would be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO EXORCIST was as good as they had already made their thoughts about it beforehand; just as they were already ready to lambast Harlin's BEGINNING the second they learned Paul Schrader's name was soaked with White-Out.
