"Escape from Hell" is not made with enough artistry to explain what it is: crass exploitation. The direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera work during the battle between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can hardly figure out what's going on; Even if the alcoholic but friendly heart doctor had not killed the guard, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the "false plague" plan had worked fine until then, but he should just ruin it. I would have given this movie a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad, and Christina Lai has an incredibly beautiful face and body), but a very disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 points. Of course, some sickos will take it as a recommendation. One thing even more worrying than this movie is that some people actually gave it positive reviews!
