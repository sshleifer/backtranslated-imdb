G & M started an odd couple downstairs in Man about the house and continued to entertain the nation in their own sitcom. What was the typical little personal charm of the parkemy on the small screen, G & M's big screen transfer was as appalling as genuis Morcombe and Wise and countless fine TV shows. <br/> <br /> Involuntary. Unsatisfactory and with a sick Yootha Joyce who died before the movie was released.
