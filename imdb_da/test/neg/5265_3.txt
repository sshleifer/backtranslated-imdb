"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is sad because it obviously tries to succeed and just as clearly has no chance in hell to make it seemingly due to lack of clear meaning on purpose. An eerie failure by droll Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who enjoys cheating the police and his competition becomes a kind of folk hero in his own mind, this flick manages to be mildly funny when trying to be fun, a little more than boring When it tries to be interesting, and forget about sentimental or poignant or endearing, even if it takes shots on these qualities too. "Ordinary Decent Criminal" has a clumsy manuscript, naive direction, journeyman execution, thin story, poor casting, mediocre action, and eventually lost in itself and sinks into a swamp of hopeless mediocrity. Pass this on. (D)
