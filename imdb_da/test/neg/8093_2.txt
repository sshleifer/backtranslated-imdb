Very flawless, but just about watchable `comedy 'that runs like a Farrelly brothers rejects. The most criminal thing about it, however, is casting. I couldn't for a moment believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the superstole's role that could pull any woman down by a hat and I couldn't believe (the very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a streetwise hard policeman! The story is predictable, but manages to raise a peek at a few times, although "gross out" is thought to be "shock comic" scenes (one with an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank) is actually horrible. If this movie is on TV, it is probably worth watching if you are very sorry, but please waste your money if you rent it !!
