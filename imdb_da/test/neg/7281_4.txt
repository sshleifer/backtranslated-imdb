I really can't see how anyone could enjoy this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-releasing piece of junk. It would probably have been better if the director had not spent most of the film exhibiting his own artwork, which is really not so remarkable. Another thing I didn't really like is when a sign was hit on the face, a gallon of blood would be spit out shortly afterwards. I don't know how people bleed over there in Japan, but I hope they have lots of blood donors.
