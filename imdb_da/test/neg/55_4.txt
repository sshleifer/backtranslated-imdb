Maybe I thought ... maybe it could be good. An Early Appearance of Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); many tribute to old horror movies; Troma label front? this movie could be a gem! I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half greeting to scary movie of yore. The story is an old, young people breaking into a house, being filled, beloved and manipulating with things that should not be manipulated. They often ?? recycled slasher movie formula is used here, this time with a thought to be the dead actor named Conrad Radzoff doing the murder. In fact, the performance of Radzoff's actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He makes the snooty Dracula style very good. But for the kids it is not so good that Combs only has a minimal part. The movie lacks entertainment value and has only one cold character and one or two scenes that can keep your attention. I do not recommend this movie unless you are desperate for something to see, and that is the only movie left on blockbuster.
