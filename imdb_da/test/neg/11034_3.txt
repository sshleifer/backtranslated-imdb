What has Rajiv Rai done for himself? Once a hit director of movies like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making a bad movie after another. I was initially thrilled with the thought of Rajiv Rai, who returned to the action genre, but it quickly became cold. As a Rajiv Rai fan, I thought I should at least give it a ride, but I went after an hour. One reason I left the movie so early, so the amount of Paki bashing in the movie was not in Rai's previous venture. Many directors have tried Paki bashing, but I didn't expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music. Rajiv Rai has always had good music so far. There is only a good song, and it is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not up to scratch, not even from Rai Loyalist Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Avoidable fare from sometime my favorite instructor.
