What garbage is actually no part II? If this movie actually ends up as it did, everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. This movie is nothing close to a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This movie was rushed in hopes of getting a few easy dollars. I started to watch the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it would be so bad. This movie was no more than a way to exploit the American people's fear of profit! If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. Movies are filled with poorly developed characters and bad plays. I really hope the production of this movie was only a few weeks. Stay away! Don't be fooled by the hype!
