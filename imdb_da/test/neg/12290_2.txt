Saw it in the video store and thought I'd give it a try. Sounded like a good story, and the cover looked good. Thats it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, though he had no times in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but it is one in a minute number that gets it to my book. When the film went together, I managed to get better, but to no avail. Asthetic was good. The sound and lighting were good, but the actor in this movie killed it for me. It was like seeing a low-quality soap opera. I just kept saying, "I can't believe they've released this movement like this". I paused several times out of pure disbelief that the play was so bad. There is so much I want to say, but I just want to say this, everything else, mostly was good, it was the play as a last cut that really made this movie in.
