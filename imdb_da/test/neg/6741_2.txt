I've seen many TVs over the years. So much so that when I start to see new shows that almost work like restorations of old shows, I am offended. Fortunately, I'm not too sensitive because all "Hot Properties" do, are updates to the cast (meaning to make them sexier) of "Design Women" and drop them in New York City instead of Georgia. is more TV-14-ish, but it doesn't make the show better. The only thing that this show has shown is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like "My Mother the Car" a classic. Her comic talents are reminiscent of a modern Lucille Ball - only more fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the casting is flashy and sexy, which may be good for some brain-free soaps, but they are just not fun. <br /> <br /> Peace
