This is a pale imitation of Die Hard franchise that just sucks. The film's low ambitions are clearly displayed when the terrorists hold the vice president's hostage and he has to call the White House to ask them to transfer some money. In most movies of this genre, the president is kidnapped or held hostage because he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button, etc. Would most Americans really have been worried if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? The honest answer is - probably not. Why the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to perform their operation and why, despite many explosions around them, the audience inside the hockey stage is unaware of the situation, unanswered questions. Let's just say this movie is really hokey, not hockey. Those who liked the movie and found it exciting to have a life.
