How do the stories become bad? It's not a question. It's a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the history development was predictable and boring. My feelings ran pretty much in a flat line all the way through. There wasn't really much to draw the viewer in the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were definitely uncharismatic. One was a salary, the other was confusing, and the third was pretty damn boring. There was absolutely no reason to be attracted to these people. Even though I knew it wouldn't happen, I hoped they would run into someone else, some more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable to me. And trailer ??? In the desert ??? The desert is a place that most people prefer not to visit. How is it that these three people end up in the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. The author really expects me to think that the last three people on Earth would find each other within a few weeks into the desert? 5) Was it really necessary for Ms. Ryan being in two scenes that required a swimsuit? Hi, she looks good, but it was pretty free. <br /> <br /> Okay, so if I thought it was so bad, why did I give it a 3? I try to be as objective as possible. Although I found Alan annoying, I must say that David Arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of a few of Albert Brooks' more annoying roles). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it just wasn't very good. Okay, then she should be confused, dysfunctional woman. But why? What did it add to the story? Her mood swings left me feeling that I was shaken (hard!) One way and then another and then another. I don't often go to movies, but one made me consider it several times. Stiff, predictable, boring. Continue at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Min 2 cents.
