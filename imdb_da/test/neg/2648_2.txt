I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends, and at first I thought maybe it was just me that didn't enjoy the movie. After all, I didn't like As Good As It Gets, and that movie won all sorts of prizes. Well, it wasn't just me ... none of my friends liked it either. It was incredibly slow, as if thinking teeth. The only action in the movie is what is in previews. We didn't go out of the theater because we all assumed something more would happen. We were not as clever as the 7 or 8 people who went out. I have never been to a movie in my life, but I should definitely have. This is too hard for me to write, considering that I am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies. It takes a lot for me to think that a movie is great, but not much for me to just like it. This movie didn't even come in the same category. Not only was the movie about 2 hours too long, but it was like two separate trite stories in one, but they were not evenly sewn together. Plus, the "soundtrack" if you could even call it that was so annoying. As Seinfeld has the same riff played again and again (difference is that I like Seinfeld) .. this movie had this jazz riff that it continued to play, which sounded very inappropriate at times, especially when people had to do with the deaths of the plane crash. Hard to explain what I mean, but believe me it was terrible. I can't say enough to make people not waste their money. After I left the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my $ 7 back .. she could have gone bowling or for the money.
