This one and the previous "Toulon's Revenge" and the next seems to be quite different from the first two movies, where the puppets were not so good. It is basically to choose your series, the first two go together and paint the dolls as killed, while the next three are a series of those who are the good ones. This plays too much like a cheesy TV series episode to be as good as third three was, and I never really wanted to try to see part five of the series. Basically, a child gets the puppets while some strange dark gentleman or something sends his evil ones out to kill. This dark gentleman looks like a kind of enemy from one of the live action Japanese shows like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it, though it has to get the credit for not making you a very painful watching movie. Just too many plot holes and things in it to be considered an okay movie. You'll see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie, even if you have a very anti-climatic battle and who the movie is before it really starts.
