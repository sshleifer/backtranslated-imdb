<br /> <br /> A few years ago, I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard it was going to be a good movie, but it turned out that it was a flop and a B-movie. The story is good, but there are no good effects in the film. (Maybe they didn't have enough money for it in the budget ???). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. The first, only and last time !!!
