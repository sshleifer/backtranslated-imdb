the movie is precious, and cage is a treasure. <br /> <br /> But would anyone agree with me to say that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /> <br /> Where are clashes? ramones ?? deviants? social distortion? the cramps ?? six guns?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! The music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at least they play cures. <br /> <br /> Plus, Randy's feather hair and spotted khakis ... it certainly looks like a movie about "punks" as a bunch of movie industry squares look punks. Although it is a 90's movie, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s. just saying'.
