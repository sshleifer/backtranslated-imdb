Movies like these do not need followers. Part of the benefit of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn't have to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video, poorly animated cash-in sequels. But apparently it was a person's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven" so we get this. Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he is not very good. Most of the movie is just a bad excuse for a sequel, and it's almost as dark, different, or entertaining as the original. I'm sorry the coming generations will have to suffer endless continuing like this without knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn't really rely on successful movies as a crutch to release banal crap. <br /> <br /> Please, no more followers for children movies that I don't need them.
