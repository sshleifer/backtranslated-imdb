First, it is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novel or anything else. From EW's website, and their review on the show when it was first sent, "... he never writes down to his audience and he never rejects contempt for his subjects. His first original television work, Stephen Kings' Golden Years "(CBS, July 16 at 9-11) is no exception." The series apparently (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, so we never saw the end of the cliffhanger they left us. But it was never quite clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all ends? <br /> <br /> When the series came out on videotape, it wondered as having the "never before seen end!" It should have said, "it should-never-seen end!" <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** The final end was the only essential part changed to the video (though parts of it all were omitted) and the changed end was what destroyed the story. For example, instead of our two pristine FBI agents realizing that they were now labeled bad guys and on the run from the evil Jude Anderson of the Shop (as originally posted), Jude simply goes up to them ... And they shoot him. Bang, death and no real feeling to talk about in the scene. Dito on the piece with Harlan and his wife go poof. While the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff hanger, on the video, they simply come out of the cock-a-doodie car. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> It was a sad ending to a pretty well-made mini-series and not making the video worth buying or even renting. Sincerely save your money and your time.
