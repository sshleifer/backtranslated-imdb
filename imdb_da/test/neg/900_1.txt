I do not know what the film's decision makers were trying to either do or say, but they largely failed whatever it was. Unless of course the goal was to confuse the viewer completely. I saw this movie simply because Drew Barrymore was in it and it turned out that she had a less than little cameo in it. The whole idea of ​​getting this kid to go on a wild tour to win a big cash prize from a gas station and to meet all kinds of wackos is completely ridiculous.
