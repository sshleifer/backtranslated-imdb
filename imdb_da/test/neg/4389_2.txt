A stupid young teen expected comedy that deals with a serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) a hooker who is confused with a foreign student, a girlfriend, a girl who loves a gay guy and the straight guy who loves her and bitchy gossip. None of the following is fun or even entertaining. Nation Lampons use to be fun back in the day. Now the name is unfortunately synonymous with crap. And this is no exception. I think Topenga was a little sweet when she was at "Boy Meets World", but it seems like she lets herself go (and yes I know she has a name, but she does something else, she becomes like Topenga) <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann gets topless; Boti Bliss is dependent on a body double (BOOOOO !!!)
