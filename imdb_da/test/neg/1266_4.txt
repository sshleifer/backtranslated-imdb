I was very willing to give the Rendition the benefits of the doubt when it came to all the negative press I had read about it. Even though about three quarters of the way through, I still thought it was jumbled and a bit disjointed, but otherwise a solid story came to its conclusion. And then the bottom fell out. Not wanting to destroy the movie for anyone, but the conclusion flips everything you kept to be facts about what and when things have been upside down for no particular reason, except for maybe telling the world, yes, I'm cool, and I by the. I love a good twist, I love a good ah-ha moment, but only when relevant to the current story. The complete deception of the filmmakers does not serve any purpose in the overall narrative, timelines did not need to be parallel, and they did not need to be separated by a week. All the revelations were ruining any profit, I was to give director Gavin Hood and scriptwriter Kelley Sane, which may be a good thing because I look back, it wasn't really that solid a movie, as I was originally supposed to give it blind credit. <br /> <br /> It is an admirable thing to try to get the expression reproduced into the public conscious public consciousness, but it needed a story deeper into the connotations and politics involved, than the glory of those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husband's disappearance and the anxious rebellion of a daughter against her "interrogator" father. I understand that the bottom-line movie participant needs a human quality to understand and therefore I do not blame it for going that route. My only nausea is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should get. Instead, we show several plot lines, all confusingly brought to the foreground before being returned to the lower areas of our consciousness, never to be returned to. So much do you forget, what to take care of, wife? interrogation transferee? CIA agent? victim? Senator? the Middle Eastern daughter and her zealous girlfriend? At the end, I really gave up and let the film take me where it wanted, which ended up being quite different from the one that was first posted. Everything that happens happens as a result of a bomb explosion. This bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so harmless that you can't believe how big the waves it was scattered. The fluttering quote of the old butterfly whistle is in full effect because a boy's task of revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many. Whether by death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse or career suicide no one really escapes rude. But at the end of the day, only the story of the man who has been carved into Egypt for torture is really interesting. We are led to believe that he is undoubtedly innocent from the start, but he is waterboarded, electrocuted, etc. To extract any information he may have. When in power they include a man without compassion or reason to stop until something is wasted (whether true or not), and an observer without the courage to attend or stop it, the situation is somewhat intrigued about how it might end. The three actors involved are the best parts of the movie and again show that the film should have worried about them at all. <br /> <br /> I will not detract from people like Reese Witherspoon, (the victim's wife) or her senate employed ex, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they actually do a good job with what they get. Even Meryl Streep, her boiled accent and Alan Arkin do not diminish too much. However, it is the trio of Jake Gyllenhael's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interrogation and Omar Metwally's victim who really shines. Naor is brilliant as Egypt tries to remain sharp as a shaver during working hours, yet compassionate and worried as a father trying to find his daughter. This man is brutal, but he is because that is what his profession requires and why he is dependent on finding answers. Metwally never gives a false second during the pain and the suffering inflicted on him. Whether he is lying or really does not know anything about the terrorist who has called his cell phone, he buys into his situation and is desperately waiting to see how the situation is. As for Gyllenhaal, a person who seems to have a performance recycled through his career with varying degrees of success finds a part that suits him. The demons enter into his soul through the trial, he is forced to be part of the wear of his body and mind, creating both ambivalence and a need to intervene. The two emotions struggle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish challenge fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> It's just too bad that one plot line works never finds itself as the main focal point, despite being the namesake of the movie. With all the roots around the edges, we as the audience are jumping around too much, lulled into a sense of time and order, and then we hit the face, as the whole unravels in more of a laugh at us then a, "bet on you I didn't feel it. "I felt cheated, and unfortunately it is the lasting effect I have taken from the movie. Had it been more straightforward, I could have enjoyed myself more, but as it is, one can still take some positive things from the seriously mistaken whole.
