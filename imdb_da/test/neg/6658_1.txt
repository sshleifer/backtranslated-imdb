This movie, "Desperate Measures", was .... I'm not quite sure how to put it into words. Should this be a comedy? I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it was. I love Michael Keaton, and I really can't understand that he did this. They did a good job of keeping my attention because I couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it would take minutes by minute. I actually just registered on this site so I could get it out. I'm not going to film. I don't have time for this, but I can't let this go out and know that I haven't done my civil duty by letting people (those who have an IQ of 85 and above) know that this is no action / thriller, it is honest to goodness fun. The people who actually got excited about this scare me. Go see a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's plays aren't amazing, but I was about to finish. Train Your Brain America!
