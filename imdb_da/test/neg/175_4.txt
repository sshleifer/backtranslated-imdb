I was looking forward to this, and to be honest there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on a story rather than shooting around the world. The many dogs were very funny, but I became bored with the wine fascists pompous whining (;-)) about their results. I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary, concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored. The most interesting is the French town near Montpelier, which is fighting for a US wine company campaign to get rid of the historic forests. A socialist mayor agreed with a deal, a well-timed election arrived, and a communist mayor was elected who knocked it down, much to the American wine export's regret ... hopefully the manager's cut would be shorter than the original.
