Talk about scary. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was kidnapped in Firefly later is there for you, but only if you like this stuff. I don't think that, to be honest, this episode was horrible. Fortunately, it is one of a few duff episodes in Season 3 and the only Charles Grant Craig episode, so you won't get much of this kind of thing in season 3. So overall consideration? Just read the summary at the top. This is a strong contender (Hell Money says hello!) For worst episode of season 3. To be honest I didn't really expect much. I wish I could Oubliette this episode completely. That's one thing they got right: the title.
