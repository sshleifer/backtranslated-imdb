I saw this at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken video camera and action characters. Of course, you expect horrible special effects with a movie this old, but I've seen silents that were better. The story has huge gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are right at certain scenes. The cameraman apparently does not know what a tripod is and had too much coffee, or something harder maybe, because the camera always shakes. I couldn't even follow the plot, but that's enough to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. UPDATE: I watched the "Epic Movie" a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2. It's NOT the worst movie I've ever seen anymore!
