I was trying to give this show a chance, but it really doesn't work well with me. Although the performance is good, the writing is not. The two oldest siblings, Derek and Casey, are just as annoying; I get the impression that we have to sit with Casey when she is the protagonist, but I do not find her at all. The parents are regularly portrayed as completely unclear. The three younger children are the most visible things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are cute as they go along, and Marti is sweet. The baselines are a little removed, and the whole premise is mostly difficult to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family does not quite try everything that is difficult to mix. On the whole, I think it marks the thumbs down.
