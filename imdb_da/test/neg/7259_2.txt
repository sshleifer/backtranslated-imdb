Other commentators have described this film as "classic 1950s SciFi" with the smart use of stock footage and documentaries and smart character interaction. <br /> <br /> Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the classic 1950s SciFi ... but the 1950s SciFi at its most dazzling stupid worst. <br /> <br /> Consider Manti's first switch is a radar station that first appears from the air and then on the ground. .. but the station is (from the air) depicted as on a mountain top, with snow on one side and semi-clear dark earth on the other, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the place, it is suddenly on an apartment, smooth white plain , kilometers from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Also consider the ridiculous pseudo-scientific babble of the highly recommended expert brought in to investigate a large claw. He says, "Well we know one thing ... It can't be from an animal, for all known animal species have a bone skeleton. Even the reptiles and birds have bones." He goes on to say that some creatures ... snails, shellfish, insects ... don't have bony skeletons. Excuse me? Let's define "animals" here. Not even in the 1950s could anyone over the age of six take this man as an expert in biology, as he clearly does not know what an "animal" is and does not have the ability to mention several broad categories of animals lacking below. skeletons (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, molluscs, arthropods, fungicides, fungi, arachnids, echinoderms .... you get the idea.) The characters are pap, 2D types ... scientist, sidekick girlfriend, big bad monster. Nothing here shows any kind of creativity. No pulse, no sign of life. <br /> <br /> There are no witty dialogues, the special effects are stupid even for their time, and stockpiling is employed with a reckless disregard for continuity. This is B movie production by its deadliest worst, with a production crew member who obviously couldn't bother trying himself half-heartedly. Use sparingly, like sleeping medicine or punishment for young children who are easily offended by poor science.
