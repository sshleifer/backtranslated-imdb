After spending half an hour investigating rumors, a gay bar outside of Tupelo, Mississippi, focuses on the SMALL TOWN GAY BAR shifts towards the murder of Scotty Weaver in Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks run by the interview topics. But there is a problem here. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, which the movie entails. It's not even in the same state. It's actually about three hundred miles away in coastal Alabama. <br /> <br /> Director Malcom Ingram does not jump straight to point out this fact, nor does he bother to mention that although Bay Minette itself is slightly more than a wide angle in the road, it is actually about two deep weather features from the great metro area Mobile, Alabama - which has a noticeable gay community, a lot of gay bars and even a ward in the Metropolitan Community Church. If Ingram is disingeuous at these points, you have to ask if he is on others as well. <br /> <br /> Speaking as one born, raised, and living in Mississippi, I have to say that I find most of the SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither the Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities in which Ingram focuses are as rural, small or as isolated as he would have imagined, and homosexuals are actually more common in the state than the film implies. That said, Ingram ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean a lack of a homosexual example, thus showing a rather deep ignorance of the Southern culture, which tends to keep those who frequent bars - be gay or equal - in low honor. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is an example where a film producer came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda. Are gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi facing major, sometimes scary, challenges? You can bet they do - but it is no excuse to fail with such a degree of reality. The DVD contains a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes, but I found the movie file itself so ridiculous that I did not waste any time on them. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
