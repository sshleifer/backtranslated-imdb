The movie is good, well picture, but no originality ... This movie is directly copied from "The Hitch" where Salman plays as a Date Dr. as Will Smith and Govinda as some fat jerk, who is desperate to fall in love with his boss at the end of the movie comes to an old Indian flimsy style, the bride's father does not like the bride's lover and gets another groom, and Govinda the bride's Love finally comes and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff. Comedy was really good, no doubt when hitch meetings Hindi would be more fun. <br /> <br /> Ultimately worth seeing, but when it comes to TV after a few months ...
