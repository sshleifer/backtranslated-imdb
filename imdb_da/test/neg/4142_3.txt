This movie was a thorough diappointment. There was no history of the story. Viewers were thrown into history without explanation and left to defend themselves to try to figure out what was going on. The action sequences were okay but confusing. They were not The Matrix and they were not Crouching Tiger. This movie is best left for cable TV where you don't have to pay to watch it or convince a friend to hire it and then go over and watch it. As a huge Jet Li fan I expected more. How can a person who is involved once in China put his name to it?
