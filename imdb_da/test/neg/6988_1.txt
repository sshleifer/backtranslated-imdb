I've seen this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago, and I have to say it's an hour in my life I wasted and won't come back, the play is shit and the scripts have a serious look at and the one who wrote them must fight, maybe the TV explodes and puts me out of my misery ..... The only good thing about this movie is that for boys and girls it has something good eye in it, Although, most would wish to disappear in terms of the film, the special effects of Sh * t, Dante? who thinks a guy dressed in harsh leather pants and a half leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie, Dante's voice is pathetic, nobody finds it threatening or scary at all. . Please tv, i ask you to blow up !!!!!!!!!!
