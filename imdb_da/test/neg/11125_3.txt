First of all, I take a question on the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name to which they refer is 'Chupacabras'. I imagine they lost 's because it sounds plural that way, but I assure you it's uniquely Spanish. Next, I thought this movie had been made many years ago. It happened as one of the B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. Then it would have been a little scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important 'effect' is the costume used for Chupacabras. Considering that this is the main character, you would believe that some serious money would have been put into it, but that is not so. The shape, colors and texture were all stupid as some stupid haunted houses in Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when Chupacabras walked where no one could walk. His movement was appalling and strange at these times, but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man. Another thing I take the problem with is that there is no animal in the world that goes around beating everything it sees without regard to actually eating it. Chupacrabas wanted to kill one, then the next, but it never seemed to eat the injured. You say, "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so far out there that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Which country is Dr. Pena from? He sounds kind of Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think he should be latino. The problem is, his accent is so bad that even a Russian could tell he wasn't a Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers fired around after this round and did not make a belly, but it continued to fire. I am not a military man, but must not have soldiers, especially the special tactical forces like this, knowing that they should do their job? Wouldn't they find out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? They didn't. They just kept shooting away while Chupacabras continued to slaughter and not eat them. <br /> <br /> Do they have to kill the little dog? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this flick because it was bad. Why did I see it all? I'm sure you've done the same at times, so don't give me a flatter. ;)
