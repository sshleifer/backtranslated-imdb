Writer director Emilio Estevez shows a concrete lack of talent here with this irreconcilable, supposed comedy. The scripture is completely hopeless, let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and poorly worked. The comedy just doesn't work. When Estevez does not use bad taste buds, he borrows used gags and makes them very bad. You'd think Estevez and brother Charlie Sheen's team would be cool ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is uninspired and unfunny, never manages to raise a laugh and barely coaxing a smile from their audience. Do yourself a favor and leave it on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Video
