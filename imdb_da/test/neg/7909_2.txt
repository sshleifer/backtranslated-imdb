I wholeheartedly agree with Greg in Ontario. I watched this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theater manager afterwards and told him "It might be the worst movie I've ever seen." I've seen a lot of movies with this person and he's pretty forgiving so I was actually shocked. (Manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was offended by a lot of humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and then the film with a primary black audience. For a while, I might not have thought that I'm getting this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that no one was laughing. The script was poor; the direction was poor; the timing was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> There were a few fun moments that were just way too much time between them. Even Airplane Two was more fun than this, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt I was sure to enjoy this movie. No. <br /> <br /> DL Hughley was fun as usual, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had some fun moments like "the white guy", but most other attempts at humor were far from the mark. Unfortunately, I couldn't give this movie a negative star rating.
