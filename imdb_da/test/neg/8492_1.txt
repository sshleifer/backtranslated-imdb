My wife got tickets for our family to attend the premiere of this movie from her employer for free. I only regret the popcorn prize and the two hours in my life wasted on this garbage film. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD in the original Mask and have enjoyed it completely. I didn't expect a remake near the original in production values ​​or writing .. but was not prepared for this vulgar pile of waste. Weak action, bad plot, a bad CGI baby passing gas and urinating in hyper "mask fashion" .. a woman turned into a giant nose, spitting mucus. Funny hello? My eight-year-old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this was over, I asked him what he thought. His exact word; "I hated it. It's like Scooby Doo movie. They take something good and have to put all the brutal stuff in." My twelve year old daughter and wife hated it too. My wife later told me that my son asks her twice during it if we could leave. He has never done it before. I'm proud of him. Believe I am a kind of puritanic, from the groans and the lack of laughter I heard in the theater, I think most of the patrons agree with me. <br /> <br /> This movie represents everything that is bad about children's entertainment today and any positive reviews must be from people financially connected to the movie.
