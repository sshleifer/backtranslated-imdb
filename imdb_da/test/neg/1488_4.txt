Like many Western Pennsylvania history buffs, I had really been looking forward to this very heralded PBS program produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. But I have to say now that I was a little disappointed. On the positive side, I generally believe that this film did a fair job explaining the main problems and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian war. In particular, its presentation of the Indians' point of view was something new and interesting, although at least it was overloaded. Also on the positive side, the mix of story and action scenes was well done and came across something better than many of these typical documentaries consisting of "expert" interviews and imagery (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many of the games had a somewhat "staged" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all, I was very disappointed and frustrated at the importance of Forbes' successful 1758 campaign against Fort Duquesne compared to the previous mistakes of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was unbelievable that there was no mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary of the British service, who was most responsible for Forbes success. Finally, I could not believe in the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run, which started as a revolution of Braddock's defeat, but ended up as a victory that determined the outcome of Pontiac's war thanks to Wiles of the same Colonel Bouquet, who must surely rank as one of the most successful British commanders in this war.
