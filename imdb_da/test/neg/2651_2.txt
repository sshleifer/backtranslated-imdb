Harrison Ford plays Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck from the District of Columbia Police Department. He tries to get the bad guys, but does not do a very good job. When we meet him, he tries to catch a corrupt undercover officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire Senator, Kay Chandler, trying to get reelected. She runs towards a candidate who has lots of money. The last thing she needs is her husband's death. She is a politician - she cannot be overthrown by emotions. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. I look at my watch every five minutes and wonder when it would be over! The story is lost in detail, as the director, Sydney Pollack, did not have to insert. We will not know about Dutch police investigations. They throw in an insight into the politicians and "spin control" they do for campaigns. After watching the movie, I still wonder why they were involved in romanticism. Isn't it anyone who cares more? Don't need more than two weeks to even consider going ?? horizontal Â«with someone else? <br /> <br /> It was good to see actress, comedian, Chicago natives and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt. Her role is not necessarily comic relief, but she was the only one I wanted to see more of. Do yourself a favor, wait for it on video, if you want to see it at all.
