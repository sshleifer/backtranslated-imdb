This is a terrible recovery from the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine where anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What were they thinking !?) accepted to be associated with it, MacLaine is seeing the original, rightly impressing, and acquiring a friend (with no written credits - or talent! - to his name) to translate the themes of the American audience - as they both agree on is stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she encouraged other friends to sign up and they made it as friends - certainly not on the benefits of this pathetically engineered, all-but-the-kitchen-sink script. <br /> <br /> I am not a French-made knee pusher, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, thought-provoking and thought-provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I would love to see it gain broader exposure among English speaking audiences - and if that means an American re-spouse, be it as well. But puh-leeze! a little respect for the topics and audience intelligence - and better direction for the actors, who couldn't seem to decide if they worked for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
