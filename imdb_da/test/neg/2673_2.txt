This movie is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh. Without giving anything away, a man's head actually explodes into this movie. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I don't think the scene was supposed to be fun, but it's nonsense. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it is a shame they have to go and do such a stink.
