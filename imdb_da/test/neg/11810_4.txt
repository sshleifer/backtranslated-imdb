Ken Burns' "Baseball" is a decent documentary ... it presents a clear origin of the game, a fantastic depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There is plenty in this movie for any baseball fan ... it is said that the movie has more sharp errors. 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. Clearly, Burns stretched out his movie to fit his "nine inning" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours ... the pace of each segment is slow, almost morose ... the music is always nostalgic and wistful. Isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is each player and their performance presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after talking head, turning every note into an emotional heartbeat that makes baseball as a metaphor, baseball like Americana, baseball's psychology and theology ... enough! This is syrupy, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all Yankee hokum he has sold us before. Ken Burns uses the folk song as the series theme song and manages to play "Take Me To The Ballgame" as many times as you might throw up. We'll get it, guy. Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends one third of the film on the Negro leagues. These segments are used to clear white yesterday until not as open as Kenny is today. For shame! He chides baseball to be separated in the thirties and eighties, but fails to realize that America was separated in those times! Burns falls over his heels in love with Buck O'Neil, a former Negro-league player and drools over every piece of footage where older O'Neil becomes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense ... Burns would have been better with an adult to help him edit his creature down. "Baseball" wins up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as Americana. Obviously, Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know we are watching games laughing and cheering, not crying and reciting soliloquies ... you listen, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
