I once heard this movie described as either you will love it or you will hate it. From reading some of the other reviews and reviews, I would venture to say this is true. I put myself in that hatred, it crowds. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This movie is bad on all three fronts. This island's Exeter (Jeff Morrow) returns to his sci-fi / b roots as Dr. Read (minus giant major prostheses). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - also George Jetson's voice), along with Les's boyfriend Vera, tracks a meteor. This is the core of the cast and is almost a double date. Read has Vera and Arnie have their "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor - aka computer). Let's just say that the relationship between George and his robot girl Rosie (and his relationship with "Susie") is more credible than the cold, Muslim feelings that Vera has for Les (and vice versa). However, the intention of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor. It is really an alien art nouveau / art deco energy storage device that moves around like a 3-lay dog. There is also the little foreign "energy" that controls Dr. Hubbel (aka, chief researcher there). Alien is, of course, from the get-go, malicious and evil. Is that the kind of science we give out? No wonder foreigners from explorers were afraid of us. From watching some of these movies we shoot first. There is no need for questions afterwards. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is synonymous with seeing some really boring science experiments like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery. It's not the fact that this is a low budget sci-fi movie or it's a bit cheesy and outdated. It really is really really boring. The whole movie is about trying to figure out what's going on. That is it. Most of the things we learn about what's going on are through monologues and self-dictation. Now add crappy dialogue, cardboard and cheap sets, and you have an Ed Wood clone macro (by the way, Ed has also made some really boring movies - avoid the Orgy of the Dead). Dialogue ... Oh, the dialogue. Jems like: <br /> <br /> "... from under 2 miles from the sea? <br /> <br /> Why not? It came through a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> "Do you think you'll be able to respect a man who's been pulling the scientific bones all the time?" <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie tries to draw a forbidden planet, this island ground, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer borders, the twilight zone. Namely, a low cost sci-fi movie (or TV episode) that is convincing enough to overcome the technical difficulties and strange situations. At the core, these films are comfortable at some level (the story, the underlying meaning or the completely comical character of the dialogue or situations). This movie has none of it. It's only 90 minutes of boredom. I couldn't even enjoy this at an Ed Wood level. I definitely recommend skipping this and seeing one of the movies I mentioned above instead. It's so bad that if I was called Dr. Forrester, I would never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except Frank maybe.
