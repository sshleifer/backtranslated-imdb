Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie with one of those who love it, and the other one hates it. As for 'Halloween: Michael Myers' curse' I fall into the latter category. I think John Carpenter in 1978 made one of the best scary films of the decade, which, despite its shortcomings, is still well-received in the 21st century. It reused many of the old horror movie units, but exploited them in original and effective ways. It had no prediction that it was anything but a movie about a blown up mental patient stalking babysitters on Halloween night. And yet there were "ideas" in the movie, but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. It sits alongside the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what took place in history, and it did so with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this 'movie' might not even understand the previous section. That's why we saddled us with this miserable and eerie part of disposable celluloid. Direction, script, acting are of the lowest layers that can be imagined. This is the type of movie that is so fun that it is numbingly boring and nausea that makes you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It's also really sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence wasting her actions with this spit of a movie. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned from this being his last movie. Maybe that's what killed him.
