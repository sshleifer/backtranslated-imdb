If you're looking for a movie that is fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not-so-great plays, cheesy "special" effects and typical sci-fi plot ... then this is the movie for you! Not the actor was bad, in fact some actors were actually pretty decent. The special effects were not the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. There was an annoying squawking to cover the sword and there was only one song played over and over throughout the movie. All in all, a good movie if you're looking for something totally cheesy and fun to have fun with. Not a good movie to see if you're looking for something serious.
