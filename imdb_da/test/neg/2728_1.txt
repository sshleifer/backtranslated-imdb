It is a little hard to believe that it came from the same instructor who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is the style, the vanity and the charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a big horror movie, but at least it had something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball with bad ideas that are poorly executed. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety: Monsters are shown in the first shot! The open dream sequence shows too much for a long time. Our hero doesn't show professional capabilities (but no one expected it from this bastard genre). There are killings that you want were more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man was never really meant to be an actor. He adequately fills the scary psychiatrist's role, but what he should have done was step behind the camera and rescue this disaster. Then we come to Midian, a creepy fake cemetery with a grimly false gate. This thing is not a major improvement over the graveyard in PLAN 9 FROM Outer Space. It gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There is nothing really wrong with the cartoon design and make-up effects here (well ... except for the guy without scalp, the guy with a cheeky chin and forehead and the cool guy with dark circles around his eyes) terrible dialogue given to them. Barker photography of the underground city is tired and this part of history could have been much better. Some may call what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes "nightbreed", we are waiting to see what he will be like (things are flying and werewolves), but when the time comes to change them, they seem to be moving forward. Their hero is far too beautiful to give a decent creature design. With the turn of Cronenberg's "character", the story just becomes less interesting until the battle for freaks vs. standards (which is just bad). Barker's mythology celebrated him here. There is no genius and little originality behind something of NIGHTBREED. The picture could have used a bigger budget, a serious script and a character design that doesn't leave you saying "oh ... oh, how paralyzing." What a waste. Not scary, not cool, not even very dark, just weak.
