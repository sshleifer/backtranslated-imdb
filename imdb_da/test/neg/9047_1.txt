And strings go. I saw this piece of horrible, smelly, worthless, junk at Cameo Movie House (now the famous Crobar Night club) on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three friends and I laughed horrible, brutal, piece of trash can. The theater was on the last leg and there was mostly drunks snoring and sleeping on the spot. They didn't miss a darn thing. The worst deal ever. These actors deserve the Oscar award for the worst, and I mean worst roles in the history of the cinema. Joke was, the theater showed another Mi Mi Lay (a big name at least!) Stinks ... barf city. Enough said. If you are under 12, you can get a few chills. Over 12, you will snore after opening credits. It's just amazing that everyone used a cent to make this movie. And to think, it is considered a "cool" classic. YUK !!!!
