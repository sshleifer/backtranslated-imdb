The film was to be released in 2002 and was very much awaited because of the promotions, but it was finally released in 2003, after the producer died. <br /> <br /> The movie is good in parts, but in general it's not amazing <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are okay, but the other scenes are not handled. <br /> <br /> The movie is similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood, and although it was planned, it was first released, so the originality has been lost <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria draws everywhere after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> Music is good but too many songs <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan sees jaded and his appearance gives away that the movie was delayed and his action seems to be Rani's good Sonali is good at rest is okay
