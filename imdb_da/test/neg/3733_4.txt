It hasn't even been two years since I first saw this movie, and yet I can hardly remember anything about this movie. Needless to say, I found it very forgettable. Of what I remember, nothing stands out as particularly good. A talented throw is wasted on what I suppose was supposed to be a dark comedy, but if it does, it doesn't fail. At best, this movie is mildly interesting. At worst, the seemingly ubiquitous cloudy sky is more interesting than history. If you like watching movies where it always seems damp and cool, then I think you can find something to like in this picture. Just try to ignore what is going on otherwise it can hardly be seen.
