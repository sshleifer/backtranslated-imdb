When I first saw this movie in the 80s, I loved it. I was absolutely fascinated by the music, the dance ... everything. But I have recently seen it all again on DVD, and I was completely affected by how extremely stupid the big line was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - honestly - a lot of scramble - and how terrible the dance was. I believe in a realistic world that she would never have entered the ballet repair. The whole thing was pretty pathetic. Sign development also lacked depth. I think this was a lot, a product from the 80s: the movie doesn't last today!
