This documentary was boring and quite stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, of course, that the documentary producer doesn't even know how Darwinian evolution works? It's a theory, and the name is simply stupid. Reading a university biology textbook could have told the documentary what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory but vicious if it is done as a policy. <br /> <br /> Also, there was no real evidence in this documentary, just interviewed some people ... no science and shadowy driver ... </> The documentary was also boring. I think it could have been edited down to 35 minutes and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are much better documentaries than this ... it wasn't worth looking at ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = D DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
