Have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that it could eventually get away with some curvy nonsense and repeated half-hearted gimmicks that it's creators can get away with? If you don't, you have never seen Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show seem to think of it as witty, edgy and poignant. It is none of these, however, it is boring, repetitive, insulting and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The "humor" of the show comes from two sources. 1) Irrelevant idioci. The view often has flashbacks to things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and meaningless. And then there are the random movie references where the shows resume a scene from a popular movie without parodying it effectively. . . or parody it at all (which is not delicious !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) The same crap that is in each episode show. One guy is a sexual deviation with STD's, AHA HA! Is it not funny ?! Hey, you know what's even more fun? Make the same joke about him anywhere between fifteen and one times in a single episode. And not just tell it many times in a single episode, make sure you pull it out so a whole scene is set aside just to tell one joke. Now you can also imagine that this same routine is used over and over for almost every character in the whole series. The creepy "un-PC" humor is not as "un-PC" as they would think you, mostly they just say what morons think of recent newspaper headlines, politicians and random celebrities. The series had moments, but now I think it's time to just take the show out of the air and do it with it. <br /> <br /> You know what's fun? I still like this more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind.
