(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a living dinosaur at a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business known as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a place where they can kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must remain on the footbridge and not disturb the ground or any creature around them. Unfortunately for mankind, a hunter enters and kills a butterfly. This insignificant action has major consequences for the Earth's climate and creates new animal species. The development process as we know it is now changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia are trying to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent and man is extinct. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The movie was a bit slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little exaggerated. The death of a single butterfly, which causes the enormous changes in the world's atmosphere and evolution, is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future were stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:43, Rated PG-13) (4/10)
