Another movie to punish us for the crime of enjoying "Pulp Fiction." <br /> <br /> If you like to see people being killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, it will probably fit the bill. Fans of the debut "Aeon Flux", where the title character literally beats thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers unilaterally, will really go for it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not exactly a smart movie. In fact, all this is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes a whole scene goes by and the only thing that happens is that you guessed it! someone gets shot. Or to spice things up, 20 people are shot. First, they are just sitting there, the next time they are dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Rough plot: A young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, gets it?), hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), gets in touch with some old French friends, one of whom are AIDS, they are planning and trying a bank hoist. Of course, the film convention states that no bank robberies on film go out without hitch, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the maturity (it's like "Dog Day afternoon" without Sidney Lumet's humor, patience, or humanity). While in the bank it goes wrong (surprise!), And the Parisian with AIDS goes wacko with his Uzi several hundred times. No spoilers here, but enough to say that you are at such an emotional distance from these characters that it is unlikely that you will fit who lives and dies at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some have called it stylish. Perhaps it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already been made, and "Killing Zoe" is captured by the convention. Nowhere in the film does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the "Pulp Fiction" play Oscar) do something completely original, stylish, funky or outrageous. Unless you are considering the fact that no movies that have taken place within a bank have had such a high body count, there is nothing else to put that one than the multitude.
