A few men have destroyed the ship on a remote island. They are so captivated by a crazy counter who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle the dungeon lives the unfortunate leper's wife. <br /> <br /> The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. Amateur actors sleep the whole lake through the movie, while an annoying insistent score is playing in the background. The various pieces of action are all filmed in an incredible unenergetic way; In fact, the film is generally completely blunt. It just seems to be on and off again. And even though the end is not that bad, you will be very pressured to look after that. As an example of 60's Gothic horror, this is strictly a purchase example of basement. Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this one.
