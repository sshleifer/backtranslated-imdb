For an indy movie, it's probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but generally it only gets a 3. The effect is not terrible, and at least they have some adults playing adult roles instead of all children who a lot of indy low budget horror movies do. The actor is a lot of wood, but at least they had a better "screen" than some movies in the crooked budget category. It is filmed much inside a building rather than a friend's cellar. The reason as a whole is not the worst. It's a Resident Evil rip off if an evil company invades a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies. I would have liked to see some kind of creature rather than the big villain just being another "super" zombie. I'm not trying to write spoilers, but this review has such a warning !! SPOILER ALERT !!! Not only do some of the casts just seem to move past the zombies (the same are reused again and again, but at least they have more than 5 people to play them). But one of the plots really doesn't fly with me. The deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the wicked business payroll. He kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess. The substitute has just shown us that he is also a really bad person and speaks as if he can clean it up (which means killing all the surviving witnesses) no problem. But then 2 seconds later he helps them out. There was no true "change of heart" feelings or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy a few minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out without problems being their savior. There was no event or anything to get me to buy into this. Worth to see if you are a fan of low budget tabs, otherwise you will not enjoy this.
