I can safely say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I usually love foreign movies. The film is no more than badly made violent pornography. If you choose to watch it, prepare yourself for endless sexism, free nudity shots, and a stupid sensationalized rape scene that I'm sure is the most important appeal to the people who like the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot beats without goals and none of the characters like it. Many scenes are filmed from the forest around the river, the girls are on to give a constant sense of someone stalking them, which was a pathetic attempt to compensate for the lack of history to tell. <br /> <br /> Maybe I wouldn't have wasted my time watching the movie if it had been accurately described in reviews.
