For all of his wonderful images, for all his good intentions, this just comes out as yet another disgusting one-sided, over-glaring, self-promoting propaganda. The message is simple, "All Japanese Giants on the Kokoda Track were sadistic, malicious f *** sticks who enjoyed throwing every Aussie troop, cutting their necks before hanging them." Kokoda not only captures "Gallipoli" only mistake (the enemy is faceless, nameless and seemingly inhuman), but manages to prove the opposite of Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect movie with a bug, we have a terrible mess with a redemption feature. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: We are without any pleasurable adaptation to the characters introduced to these seemingly rather laid back, two-dimensional people that we will never ever ... sympathize with. We are kept at such a distance that even when we could so easily relate to the characters, they find a way to stay away. It alone is a tedious function as it drives us from the actual plot, helps the terrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression and makes it so much easier to see the contrast between an overt sentimental end and an otherwise missing body of a <br / > <br /> In other words, it draws us through a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them) and, as it should, we are thrown into another eye-roles of a skirmish ending faster than it began. So for those not yet uninformed: when it comes to ending, it starts again, only to end when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and disturbing pace! <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the ultimatum: This is supposed to educate us on the events of the Kokoda track. It doesn't come close. Not only does it describe a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (sprinkling a little "mateship" on top in an attempt to make it relevant), but succeeding in making one thing a movie as important as it should do, it does Don't care for us. My eyes were always glued to my watch all the time. The audience around me, all proud Australian, confessed when they came across how big the movie will be, moaning, moaning and whined in disappointment, as every one of the painful ninety-five minutes drowned on (in a short time it felt like apocalypse now: the difference is that Apocalypse was now a good movie and deserved the three hours it got) and to the point where suicide could wholeheartedly be an alternative, it should be mandatory for this movie to be seen. <br /> <br /> While considering how much television has advertised this garbage, I would say that it is mandatory, in a subliminal sense of the word. <br /> <br /> See if you like beautiful pictures. Although you would rather see Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway, as they have superior cinematography and ACTUAL plots. Gathered: *
