I am almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with production are almost too many to mention. The script is under-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to discard it). The direction is worse. Most of the film consists of long shots intersected with close-ups intersected with cross-cuts of mostly non-erotic porn (more widely of course in the "uncomplicated" version). The cinematography is especially underpair, which gives the whole production a cheap washed out look that undermines some of the elaborate sets of designs. The movie should have looked much better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would easily have been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it "paganography") is thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Bob Guccione obviously lavished many bucks on this, but it all seems like a big waste. If you want a much better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, look in the middle of 79's BBC production of I, CLAUDIUS instead ... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, see one another place.
