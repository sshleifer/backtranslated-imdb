OK, at first this movie was not like the book at all. I read the book when I was 13, and since then it has always been my favorite. When I wait for another book to come out, it's the book I'm going to fill out the time. I have 3 copies for God's sake. anyway, I knew this would not be like the book, but come on! They could have done a little better than this. I seriously think if I wanted to see American werewolf in Paris or London than I would see these movies. They took a very good story and twisted it around in a copy of a story that has been told over and over again, and frankly I'm tired of seeing it. I mean hello the best part of the whole f ***** g (sorry) story is she ends up with Gabriel. He does not die What was it about? And he is old in this movie. Gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 then ** it. Awww. And Astrid, whom he ** came up with the idea that Astrid was Vivian's Aunt no no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyways yes it was my little rant seriously pi ** ed off. hope it helped.
