1. Watched 2/25/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): Predictable action thriller where any frequent movie-goer could guess what's coming next. Charlie Sheen is the good old boy for the president who just doesn't happen to like the rest of the president's staff. Of course, he is involved in a situation where he is framed again and again, and he has a friend in the White House, played by Sutherland, who obviously does not get so far in the way. His other friend is a reporter played by Linda Hamilton (who has little to say or say in this meaningless role), and of course his greatest and best friend, the President himself (Sam Waterston), keeps his friend to the end despite everyone else is killed around him. Brainless, but action-packed meaningless triple despite loads and lots of acting talent (all pretty much wasted.)
