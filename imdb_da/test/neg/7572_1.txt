And scary, over-the-top-acting, you can enjoy this nonsense. Generally, atomic bombs are life mutations within a day or two (or, according to other viewers, they wake up). Or so it seems. And apparently massive nuclear explosions off the coast of Spain don't make anyone ask any questions at all. Come to think of it, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever at all (why would evil socks attack lighthouses?), So the Nukes go without reason, don't stand too much. <br /> <br /> OK, get past this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorious thing you make in kindergarten, you can actually stand here. But for once, the complete lack of doing does not help, as the monster attacks in all their bare rock bottom budget "glory" are left. I doubt you will see this though, so stay away.
