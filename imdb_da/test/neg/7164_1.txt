Movies like this simply disturb me because they do not deserve the funding that enables them to end up in my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its jacket search and even more impenetrable in its choice of casting (why is Ms. Song a romantic interest? Would they just have an Asian woman in there, or actually give her incredibly clever character this "message" movie story a new one) perspective)? You have very little going on in approaching this movie, and even less as the story unfolds. But a good hour in the matter, I realized that the boring casting is that all the casting agent could kill up, the unconvincing character studies are the result of the author's brain drain, and the story is amorphous and plagued by unrestrained references to the fire of capitalism, materialism, and moving forward in the postmodern world. At the end of this movie, just before I nodded and missed the last two minutes, I realized that "Everything's Gone Green" is a product of "connections" in the movie world - a person with very little talent known Someone with very little managerial skill knew anyone with absolutely no marketing sense (but lots of one-time ego) and dodged this boring and ineffective attempt at whimsy and humor-with-a-conscience nonsense. And this is the most annoying thing - how many infinitely better scripts were transferred in favor of this almost unacceptable triple? Skip this movie and feel good about yourself to do it.
