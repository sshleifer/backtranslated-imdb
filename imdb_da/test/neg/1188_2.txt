As a massive fan of the three television series, I was very interested in learning that LoG moved on the big screen. However, in my more honest moments, I had doubts about the probable success of the concept and whether the authors would be able to maintain the high level of humor, comedy and horror that infused the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fear was not unfounded and the movie was a big disappointment. I struggle to understand the other comments on this site. Of course, people are right about their opinions, but the guys I saw it all agree with me, and they are just as big fans as I do. <br /> <br /> The action lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when they are not the best they are still very visible. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. Worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the cinema. So rarely have I felt so completely uninspired by a movie and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. I write this comment as a warning to other League fans - get a wide range of meaning about this movie before going to see it. If you love the League, you might convince yourself that they didn't completely destroy their move to the cinema. If you cannot convince yourself of this, then you will have tarnished in your mind the otherwise immaculate genius exemplifying the television series. <br /> <br /> LoG in the cinema? More like log. (or small brown fish).
