I thought id check out this movie as I am currently making a movie about a mysterious box, so it would be great to see how this movie took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> Before going to the cinema, I had a high expectation of this movie. With actresses like Cameron Diaz, you'd expect the play especially her to be amazing. the play was a kind of disappointment to the movie, the character's accents changed throughout the movie, it made it incredible. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​a strange box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story, but I feel the director lets it down, this movie had potential it could have been much much better than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie had no space for it. It was too confusing and needed a stable story. nobody wants to go into the cinema and think about what i just saw 'i didn't understand it at all', sometimes it can be exciting and make people see it again, but this movie never made people want will ever hear about the movie again. all the time I noticed that half of the audience had left before the end. I feel that every person had been knocked down on this movie because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the movie were. <br /> <br /> Let's put the bad points on one side ... I liked the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. It was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie, and the way it was put together, made me imagine it and how devastating and frightening it would have been to be in that position. The lighting and the effects made it an excellent look, so this scene a little more than the 1990s than the 1970s that this movie should be. <br /> <br /> This movie was confusing because it had so many different bits to it. parts that you expect to be summarized at the end, where everything comes clear, but it did not, it went completely against an audience's expectations, even if one left the film on a cliff hoop and did not give the audience a reason why things could work and do it really well, but it did not, it was a creative, differently unusual movie, I thought it had the potential could have been better, disappointed not enjoyed it, would not buy it on DVD to be honest.
