This movie has more on its record than a sumo wrestler, and the result for the viewer is indigestion. There are some good performances, but the subplots are alien and largely unsolved. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found all the signs odd, and if you can't identify with at least one character, there's not much to get excited about. All in all, this is a classic example of trying to overdo it too little.
