Another horrible movie from Hollywood. This time, a woman helps the revolution in a Central American country. yes yes yes. Hi lets make a movie without any realism at all. I'm so sick of movies like this. The actors and actors are miserable, the effects are cheesy and the dialogue is horrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the evil president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he is very proud of this. Well, I shouldn't have expected much of this movie, and I didn't. And I'm glad this sucks bigtime. I wonder what kind of people like this movie. My guess is younger people aged 12-16 years. And I think some people like because of Kristin Dattilo. Well I am in none of these groups and I hate it.
