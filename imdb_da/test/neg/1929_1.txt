Dear Mr. Seitzman, or who I can hold responsible for Seitzman does not meet with his righteous fate to be eaten alive by Rabid Wolverines; <br /> <br /> I don't know you and therefore can't comment on your character; For all I know, you give charities and help small old ladies across the street. However, I must insist on the common good that you never write another script as long as you live. Put the pen down, walk away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to claim the wounded brains, I have seen a movie or two in my life and I think you will find my advice useful: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include love scenes where overbearing teenage girls name the body parts of their girlfriends after US states. To write such a scene, do not mention the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey"; It causes unnecessary speculation about which cities are taking nipples. It's also almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes movies to enhance class distinction. <br /> <br /> 3. Bludgeon does not crowd the audience with exhausted clich√©s. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain and it cleans them of their concerns. We'll get it. Yes, the roses continue to bloom in Kelley's dead mansion, although all other plants have begun to rot. It is a symbol of their love. It is also very painful when applied by tight trauma to the backs of our heads. For God's love, Mr Seitzman, we get it. We get it all, all over the country. Amish people, the harsh, unborn babies - we get it all. <br /> <br /> 4. Don't require the actors to perform mime sequences. Ever. No, never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I say that you should ease the trite symbolism? Because the audience can draw the parallel between the restoration of the restaurant and the building of the relationship between Kelley and Sam without help. Indeed. We'll get it. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and erase the following lines and some lines are similar to them: "I don't know what we are anymore." "I do not want to lose you." "He's like the rest of them!" (And it follows, "Father, you don't even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, she's in heaven and runs around in a field. We'll get it. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news we get it. <br /> <br /> I've seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I would just have left the theater, but an elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" painted on the side fell from the sky and attached me to my seat. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
