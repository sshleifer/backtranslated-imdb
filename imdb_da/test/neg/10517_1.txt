Everyone knows that late night movies are not Oscar competitors. Lived. I think I will admit that I was a little pushy and bored and figured I would get some skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when info on the TV guide channel makes it fun with the movie in the description. It even gave half a star. To be fair, I put the whole thing thrown because you were soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words that come out of these people mouth and how they tried to be serious. Most of the time I think people on the screen tried their hardest to not laugh. In fact, I think of a scene, they laughed. Anyways the movie didn't make sense. It was such an Sopranos episode with the cool gay guy. Only the Sopranos are fantastic show. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, just sex scenes from the 90s. You know the kind that uses shadows and silhouettes instead of meat. I gave it a two reason why this flick creates a good drinking movie. I mean with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. If it's late at night and all that is on TV is this and that Tony Little guy and his training bike, then I suggest Tony Little.
