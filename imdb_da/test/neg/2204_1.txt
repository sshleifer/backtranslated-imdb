This movie is such a piece of incredible crap. Let me first talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is all very bad. We have told computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - WHERE WITTY !!! I beat the directors cheering over one for an hour), who basically controls other Company software for glitches etc. So we start with his order pizza on the internet and then put fireplace on her screen (EXTREME computer skills shown so far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program that breaks down the entire system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a major problem, but the virus created to do so could be done in about 1 minute with a single batch file. <br /> <br /> We continue any event. She gets this call from another block (working at the same company), and this fool says you click this symbol, which apparently opens up a secret internet gateway to a lot of unprotected "top secret" data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disk and now the people who created this loophole are out to get her. Of course it is only after she drives up one of the evil guys before attempting to kill her, BEFORE she jumps into the sea from her boat, BEFORE she is won in a random hospital. # 1: You can't create a loophole on the Internet to access a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did it come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic power of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem No. 2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She couldn't just pack her stuff and go. <br /> <br /> So these "hackers" or whatever changes Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and comfortable enough, is all her id away. Then she returns home and a cat and museum hunt continues and continues. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe her. Then she has to use a lot of tactics to get into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling her in) and coming back to her old computer. She starts talking to another random block and finds out who is behind everything via a BS address that the director knows the audience is too stupid to believe. <br /> <br /> Then she goes to some center to send all this information to the FBI. She must apparently use a mainframe to send items to the FBI. But saw the same fool who tried to kill her before she threw her in the water, caught her and easily hacked into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Now, fortunately, she gets it, and even though the virus only worked on software, it now also works on the whole system. It brings the whole mainframe down, which has all the fake information because the mainframe was right in the middle of some conventions ... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAFT! Anyway, now uber virus works and Angela (the real now) runs away and later kills the evil guy with a fire extinguisher. Of course he has a gun, runs up to her, so he is like 2 feet away and then chooses to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who does not know much about computers will be deceived into thinking that this shit is possible, but not one thing is accurate with regard to computers or the web. And I honestly doubt I would see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (* cough LMAO *).
