Films about the everyday are often the most interesting of all movies to me, in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of everyday life. The French cinema often seems to be very good at this kind of thing and I love the French cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was about everyday life. It didn't have much of a plot. It was just signs that lived in a city, very normal people, and only things happened. But that was not very interesting, and much insight was not investigated. The movie captures a bit of mood, but it was not a particularly captivating mood. And even though I don't think much about the film doing wrong, almost every level managed to do something right. <br /> <br /> There were many signs in this movie. Many of them look straight, so it was hard to find out who was who and what were their relationships with each other. I don't mind making an effort to understand a movie or even see a particularly complex movie more than once to iron out the details, but this was a puzzle that wasn't worth solving for me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can really say about this movie is that the filmmaker was comfortable - functional, not brilliant, but comfortable. The camera often caught some pretty postcard-type shots. But it has rarely found the very interesting little details. <br /> <br /> I've seen a handful of not-so-good movies so far at the Seattle International Film Festival, but it was the only one who couldn't get any applause when the credits rolled. I felt a great collective sigh of relief when the movie was finally over. But I suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
