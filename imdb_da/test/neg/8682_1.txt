<br /> <br /> Very boring, cumbersome adaptation of Amis funny satire. The hero is portrayed not as a sympathetic loser, but a mere oafish cretin. Most of the remaining are pure cartoons with only Helen McCrory putting in real quality and giving something of the novel. The setting of the period has been camped as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war era for horror comics and rock'n'roll. A real dud even by the standards of poor UK TV. <br /> <br />
