It's my fault. They all told me that I should avoid watching this movie because I am a big fan of the old TV series. They were right. Although the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "do not see now") Julie Christie is not so bad, the whole movie shows a cheek and self-awareness that is clearly without any justification. A comparison between Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes to mind. In fact, Belphegore 2000 is much more due to the new Mummy movies than to the old series. But then scripting is terrible, speed there is none, and at times the movie is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the grave looks stupid), with cats that are clearly thrown when jumping (landing with their coffin first ). Belphegore moves around like a statue on wheels, neither impressive nor frightening, and the psychological drama unfolding in the old television series when the heroine learns that she is a villain is completely neglected. This movie is so wasted (wasted money, spilled players, wasted ink) that it hurts. It is a sub-pair of Mummy rip off, which is only good for some laughs, but has nothing to do with the Greco classic (she also has a small role in this movie - in the cemetery).
