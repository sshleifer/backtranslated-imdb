This movie is not worth watching, at least not in a movie theater. The story is hard to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just as bad / weird that sometimes it seems like it. American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars are just one example. The action of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as usual, but I think Jenny Lampa works like Jasmin seems very bad. Zara Zetterqvist works quite well, she has not been seen as an actor in Swedish films for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it is released on DVD or on TV.
