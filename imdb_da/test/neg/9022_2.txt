This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest, where he had a leading role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is particularly awful; it seems that the editor (if there was one) literally fetched film pieces out of the floor and glued them together. The opening should be seen as believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! I know there are "B" movies - but are there "H" movies? In this case, this is an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan.
