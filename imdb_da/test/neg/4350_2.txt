Decent action scenes, but the movie is saddled with a slow, horrible story, almost non-existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a serious horrible story ... Did I mention that history had no meaning? But in his defense, the action scenes were impressive enough, even though they left you scraping their heads on why they just happened. There is not much else to say about the movie. It's a smooth, fun action adventure that doesn't make sense. It's like seeing a worse version of the Matrix and skipping the whole story and dialogue.
