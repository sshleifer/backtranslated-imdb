I saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and I can only imagine that the guy is a shill. Actually, it is pretty good to shop with the women's lead, but the whole movie is just so eerily boring I could hardly bear to sit through it. This is the very definition of dullness. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is rated as 8 out of 10 in 7 votes. It has to mean that the director, director's boyfriend, producer, actress and drinking companions have given their own film a 10. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who just want to be entertained or enjoy a good story, you avoid this. This man on the street should give it a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> FDA note: while this movie can be used as a tool to get a good night's sleep, no medical value is implied or offered.
