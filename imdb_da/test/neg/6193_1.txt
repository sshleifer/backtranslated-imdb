Let me first say that I have previously been a great carlin fan. I think George is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet. What made George so good in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things. It was not always meant to be fun, but you always respected their opinions because they were presented in such a smart way. But you are all sick is just a long rant. he gives us no unique perspective on something he just gives us a long list of things he is on. There is no insight, no wisdom, just an old man who complains about an hour about things we have all complained about. And on top of that, it wasn't even fun. You are all sick appealing to stupid people who cannot handle anything more advanced than anything simple and direct. I don't mind the anger burned comedy, but George could have done so much better. I really hope George George's next show will live up to the quality that George has shown in the past.
