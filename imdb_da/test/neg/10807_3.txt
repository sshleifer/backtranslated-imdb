Now I looked at this when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then we were again teenagers. But honestly, not so good in a movie in thought. Sort of a hair metal, the Dokken version of the Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie doesn't quite mean it's unmatched; But this seems to lack the charm that contains a lot of the common Mst3k food that usually contains. But if it was on cable and I was sorry to drink beer - then I would see it again. But then again I have seen Howling VII about five times now, so maybe you really should not listen to me. <br /> <br /> Anyone else thinks it's so sad that the director allegedly commented on movies alone? And why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much?
