The fact that a movie is on DVD does not guarantee that the quality is very good. The fact that the quality of the movie is blurred does not mean that you should not buy it. In fact, this review applies to 2 movies paired on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The plots of these films are of little importance. They are only of interest to people who collect Holmes films ?? Anyone who just wants a few of the better deals would do well to buy some of them made by Jeremy Brett ?? or, in a pinch, Basil Rathbone. There are a few other very good Holmes movies with good actors on a single shot basis ?? such as "Seven Per Cent Solution" or "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes". In any case, these films are considerably less beautiful. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of movies with some of the best actors to make Holmes, although the results tend to be disappointing. This seems to be the only disc with these movies on it (although "Deadly Necklace") appears in itself in the same version on other discs. "(Sherlock Holmes and) Deadly Necklace" dates from 1962, even though it doesn't look or sound like that. Some who have seen this may be surprised to hear that it was produced by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer hasn't knocked out any real things, but where Christopher Lee was worried, they usually did a better job. Print a direct transfer from a fairly worn 1: 1.33 black-and-white copy. The quality of the color suggests that the original might have been in color, and the carved ends of the film's aspect suggest that it could originally be 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The movie is set at the beginning of 20th Century ?? not unlikely when Holmes was still working then (and actually did not die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted to any Doyle story. It involves an Egyptian necklace, and Professor Moriarty appears as a world famous archaeologist as well as prince of crime. The foundation is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in this movie is that ?? for creepy reason ?? Hammer filmed it in Germany. It was still filmed in English. It was then baptized in German and then re-encoded in English. So what you hear is not Lee or any of the other original actors, but a lot of unknowns ?? Not that outside of Lee, I doubt anyone would know any of the other actors. This is too bad since Lee (see his "Hound of the Baskervilles") makes a pretty decent Holmes. As it is, his voice is doubly discouraging and clear as bread pudding without raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music for this movie is primarily jazzy, in a possible attempt to be "period". Too bad nobody thought about ragtime. As it is, the music is not related to what is happening on the screen and is often unlike the action. The second movie is "Sherlock Holmes and" The Speckled Band "from 1931, starring a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the picture and the sound is right up to the 1962 stakes and actually a bit better. Massey makes a pretty respectable Holmes, Although he certainly does not own the roll in the way Rathbone did and Brett does. The other thespians participating in this production are unlikely to have an interest in modern readers. due to post-Victorian scene and silent movies, it should be noted that "The Deadly Necklace" is available on DVD alone, "The Speckled Band" is only available with the previous movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little to say about this movie.The settings seem to be a strange combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices like a primitive dictaphone). to buy the DVD with pairing one instead of a DVD with "Deadly Necklace".
