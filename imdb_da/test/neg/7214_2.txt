You stop making followers for good movies. The original was a great movie that was over the top with battles, sex and one of the coolest characters that adorned the screen in the 90s. The story is trustworthy, as if you were in bars in the south, you would know. But here comes this piece of junk Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Let's just hope they are serious about the title and never make another Roadhouse. It does not have the charm of the original characters, nor is the story really believable. The story is more of a Steven Segal-type action that although Roadhouse 2 is a B-movie, it still doesn't click, as some B-movie actions still sell the movie, no matter how cheesy it is. The only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out, one question is left from the original Roadhouse. Patrick Swayze's character Dalton, is Dalton his first name or surname? Now I will save you $ 4.00 rental fee. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER DO ANOTHER ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
