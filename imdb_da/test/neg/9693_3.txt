Dramatically? Yes ...... Historically accurate? Not quite! .... This movie twists the Bibles details of the river by placing Lot meeting Noah under the ark building. Fascinating time journey for Lot partially made by NBC! .... that Lot was not born before 2136 BCE, 234 years after floodwater's (2370BCE) .... It's like having George Bush meet with William Shakepeare! And what about this guy floating around selling goods and nicknames to Noah? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie based on historical facts dramatically, but don't twist around placing people where they weren't ... especially when it comes to God's Word.
