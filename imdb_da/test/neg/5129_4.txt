SPOILERS, BEWARE !!! Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. Some things confuse me about it (eg Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to be so good at dancing, Alex's answer "In 25 years", it is not Alex who must be 18?) And some things fascinate me about it (I LOVED the spins!). Overall, it shot me. When this film was made, I was not even born. I didn't really see the 80s (I was born in '85) and I have to wonder: Sometimes Alex just wanted to run a little or throw himself all the time, not really dancing, just slamming things and throwing her head back and waving with his arms - was it considered "dancing" then? If it was, I'm not sure I could have asked. The spiders, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of it - my neighbor's kids could have done better! Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? When she's not going to work for almost a week, won't she be laid off? Living in a warehouse - I can almost see it, but not quite. It doesn't seem right that she is a welder, owns a warehouse, and tries to get into the ballet. None of it really makes sense. I should not be too judgmental considering my own background, but thank you. Perhaps Jennifer Beals is feminine for me to see her as a welding machine, I don't know. But in some way they could have chosen a better actress. The actors were fine. I even liked the romance. You make your own decision. But mine is - rent it once, don't see it again - it's not worth it.
