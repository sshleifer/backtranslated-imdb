I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and because David Zucker was the director. I saw his former "Naked Gun" (both), Airplane and Top secret! And I liked, at least I was good and laugh. I'm not saying the movies I mentioned were masterpieces, but were OK. I can't remember any more stupid movie than this. It's amazing how the Hollywood industry is in all decadence. If some studios spend money to produce this horrible picture, it is not a surprise that these kinds of stories are more common these days. This is a clear expression of a decadent civilization in which gender symbols and stupid sites are produced to entertain ordinary people. I have nothing good to say about this movie. If you plan to rent it or buy it, don't waste your money or your time, avoid it anyway. Although you are a fan of one of the actors, it is not worth it. In fact, this can be a very good example of what a director should avoid. I don't want to see a Zucker movie again. (He plans to lead the fourth sequel of scary movies, imagine it!). Pathetic. Terrible.
