Let's cut through everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers", the latest movie from Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror movie, is deeply bad. And like a movie in general is a big disappointment. It is nothing but a reheated "sixth sense" and as long as there is still a picture, there is no reason why the Earth is paying money to see this turkey. Ultimately, horror / slasher movies such as. The "Final Destination" series, "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "The Ring 2" and "The Grudge" are becoming increasingly dependent on big shocks without payout (for example, something goes out on the person's screen, develops a gasp from the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a collar or something.) Little goes into making it a truly scary experience like "The Sixth Sense" or "Signs" or some of the classic horrors Movies of the 1940s, '50s and' 60s. <br /> <br /> "Messengers" rely on the same old tired clich√©s as these newer, much inferior films and are therefore old, tired and - to my surprise - ended as one of the most boring movies I have seen for a while. The plot has another stupid family, led by Father Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), mother Denise (Penel Annie Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop", the television series "Desperate Housewives"), big sis Jess ( Kristen Stewart, "Zathura: A Space Adventure" and Toddler Ben (Evan Turner) moving to North Dakota from Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for the move is never really outlined here, but it has something to do with father's inability to find work and Jess's drunk driving flights. We know that there will be problems immediately because they move into a large gothic house in the middle of heaven; a domicile that looks like Munsters cottage. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie shows something really awful happened there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates the place (hello, who could blame her), but optimistic pop jumping to make a go of raising sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and resembles Kevin Costner in the movie version of "My Name Is Earl"), a traveling driver and expert on raising sunflowers, things start to pick up. <br /> <br /> But then strange things begin to happen; Jess is terrorized by a violent invisible force in the house (of course no one else but the two-year-old Ben can see it so she is labeled a flake) and the crawlers are hanging. Ben is also able to discover the monstrous creatures, but since he is two, he cannot articulate it. Scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally, I wanted to shout at the screen, "He can't tell you! He's two freaking" - years old! "Yes, the only protagonist who can solve all of these things is a dumb toddler, is really smart. <br /> <br /> Yet, we're back to considering Jess when and if Ben ever wants to describe the paranormal visions he sees if the father will work sunflower things; if the high plains drive is a good guy or bad, what is pointed out by the George Plimpton-looking real estate agent is how a pitchfork threw himself in the back can only be a flesh wound; the family is and where all the crowds come from. <br /> <br /> All this while waiting and thinking about something - something - happening, the conclusion is also really paralyzed, and again the question of how a spirit that does not have Any physical body can harm a living person. Very boring, meaningless and most horrible of all, not at least scary. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are many crows in this movie.
