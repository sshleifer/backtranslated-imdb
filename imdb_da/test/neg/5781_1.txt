Be very afraid of anyone who likes this movie. They probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child. It's so terrible I refuse to revive a plot. Oh yes, there wasn't one! This movie is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who do not want to think of a theater. Are the bad guys going? Are the good guys going? So what!
