This movie is a bad movie. But after seeing an infinite number of bad horror movies, I can say that it's a little different than many I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly regular slasherhory, but more like the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us many inane dialogue scenes, but they go much further than in most movies of this type. Because of this, some of the victims seem a little less like cardboard cuts. Just a little. I had a difficult time figuring out what happened at the beginning and wondering if certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are fleeing the killer and taking refuge in a car. In the glove room they find a gun. "Thank god!" one of them rejoices with joy. The guy's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head, and it took as little time for me to wonder: "What is it? Where's the mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" So BOOM! The head explodes, and I figured it should be one of the guys in the car who got his head shot with a shotgun. I love that scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 10.3.
