Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: A complete suction hole, in every possible way. He laughs at all his guests jokes, he asks the most boring questions, and he will never dare to contradict them. He hits me like the type of person who wants to suffer from ... everyone. Friendly, boring, disobedient Harry. He probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they are not bombarded with what we, the people, want to know and have the right to know. Let's say that: he interviews as if he's in a red country. 02/10, 2 for the guests coming on the show, but it all seems pointless when Larry begins to question emotional issues like "What is it like to be a mother?" followed by the usual answer in line with "Being a mother is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me: it is wonderful but tiring".
