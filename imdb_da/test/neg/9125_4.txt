As with many successors, this just doesn't have the quality or effect of the original. The first one is up there with the rest of the greats. This just doesn't cut it. The first movie had a magical "good time" feeling of what is missing from this movie. We were enamored by all these characters (minus Richard Dreyfuss) in the age of innocence. Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. While this is what happens in real life, we do not expect this to happen to our favorite movie characters! The film does not have the humor that the original had, and we waited to laugh. Which little humor is there is dark. The first movie also highlighted what is probably the best soundtrack ever while this is good, but not even close to the original. This film is so completely different from the original that it is not even a successor. I gave it a 4.
