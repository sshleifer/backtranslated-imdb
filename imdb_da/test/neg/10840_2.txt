There were some decent moments in this movie and a couple of times it was quite fun. However, this did not matter to the fact that it was a huge boring movie. There was no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this movie, and I couldn't understand why he would even consider leaving his wife to be this chick that he apparently was knocked out of. There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler in Armageddon. Hell, there was better chemistry between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the movie that just didn't have to be there and were scary slowly moving. <br /> <br /> This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait until it's been half a year on video and rent it in .49 cents bin if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon and you can't think of better movies to rent.
