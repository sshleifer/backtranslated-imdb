The digital effects were made on the cheap and the action sequences lacked tension. This was mainly made for television and it shows. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Plans look down in shame! and for Robert Carlyles Dick Van Dyke London accent, no comment! If you want to pass an hour or two when you have nothing on it will do. If you are going to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and download it in Copenhagen at Asda, this is where it is going! If the budget was bigger and Richard Doyle's book came closer, it could have been something special, but as it stands, it's a little poor. Watch trailer instead! Or read the book and see what could have been.
