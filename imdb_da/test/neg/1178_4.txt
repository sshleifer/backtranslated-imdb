There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based movies, but more than anything else, how the filmmakers are creative about the story. If they have such great fantasies then why not use that talent to make something original? Otherwise, stick to the facts. This could have been an okay movie if only they had done so. Ed Gein was an insane scary man. It has been said if you were to take Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, pack them into a person, Ed Gein would still be more ill / scary. So why can't anyone make a movie about him who can convey this? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately frightening than fiction? <br /> <br /> I've read books and watched news programs about him, and now I'm not a writer or anything, but I think there is enough evidence on Gein that it shouldn't take much to write a story of all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never been documented. I realize he was only found guilty of 2 murders, but with all the evidence found in his home and left, there should have been many other ways to put this movie together instead of using the substitute's relationship. his mother and girlfriend as filler and too much. <br /> <br /> I guess what I'm wondering about is this ... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein? Why didn't we know his mother, father and brother and the relationship between them ... what made him psychopathic he was ... what abuse was he like a child who might have contributed to the man he became? Instead, the only thing we got from his childhood was flashing by him as a little boy ... running. <br /> <br /> Finally, I give it 4/10 stars. That's 2 for Gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Although it was a kind of bad casting in my opinion, Gein was a little man, and possibly relaxed, and Hodder is anything but small and not near what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
