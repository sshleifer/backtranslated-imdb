Over the past few years, Ron Miller (son-in-law Walt Disney cum Producer) has ruled out live-action crap on a stick that often starred in the very boring Dean Jones whose entire career was based on that kind of light, empty fare. Other horrible films from the same period include Pete's Dragon, The Last Flight of Noah's Ark, Unidentified Flying Oddball and the dreaded Condorman. I don't want to mention Tron because I thought it was ambitious, and Miller was only the executive producer on it, so he had little to do with actual production. But he was in full force when this godly piece of humanity was expelled from creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. The second successor to the beloved Love Bug story finds Herbie in love with another car that also has the brain and heart. There is a race, some lame evil guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. The shot in France is actually the film nicely photographed and the landscape is lovely. But you get the idea that the film was made so that everyone involved could have a three-month holiday in France. The rest of the movie is a wreck. Prat falls, bumbling thieves, evil German racing competitors and a beautiful jumping feminist all fall under the category of warehouse supply. The movie's biggest insult: Attempting to further develop Herbie's love personality through shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements that suggest a horny seventeen year old makes Disney's writers an injustice to our cute little VW. Then again I would think it would be difficult for anyone to top Helen Hayes driving Herbie around a skyscraper edge in the second outing.
