I'm a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of serial killers. Of course, the director refused to investigate the movie he created because half of the film was fictitious. More than that, Ed Gein's character was portrayed in the wrong light. I didn't rent the movie to worry about the vicar and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to see Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was horrible, the only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because gore wasn't that bad. Acting = horrible actors = sub par Movie = waste of time. <br /> <br /> A big sad thing, but I won't give up my search for a good horror movie.
