As a child I never understood why anyone would see this very crappy show. It was pretty stupid, and I had always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to come in some kind of fatality (they were so annoying). Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new approach to cartoon. While I still think it was complete crap, it's only compared to the American version of the show. It was because I read a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched were quite different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots responsible for the syndication of the series thought it was too violent, so they cut it out of the episodes. It's bad enough, but what they did more is convinced - they have actually cut the episodes apart and split them together to create shows that were not original! For example, an episode may consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really don't know if the original show really was bad - it could have been brilliant. But who can tell contemplating everything we should see is this American mess!
