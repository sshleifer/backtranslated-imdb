I saw this night for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But it probably has hilariously awful moments that it's worth seeing. First and foremost, was it deliberate to get the boy to be babysitting completely? He even says to Costello a la Mae West "you fascinate me!" as Costello does a double take. God only knows what would have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk. This child would have seduced him in the heart! Then there is the most important male dancer. He is completely inept. Laugh with laughter as he jumps and pranks without any talent over the giant's grave while he never looked better in his life. The two romantic leads are zero, waste. Abbott will sing a line and it was dubbed by another singer. Geese, I don't think he couldn't even hold a tune! Costello manages to be charming in his I Fear No Number, and I think very young children like it, but there is not much to recommend it. But Oh, the seductive little boy! This aspect alone blew me away! Plus the fact that the family accepted someone from the street without referrals to babysitting a child! Today, little femmy boy will be taken away from them!
