Wow, I was told this would be a B movie worth seeing. I feel I was misled after seeing this preview event. The reason is at best a twisted of several films. Even the title is a recording on another movie if you can give the movie so much credit. I'm sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaning assistants. I wouldn't waste your time on this one. This movie seems to be a bunch of wannabes that came together and made a bad idea of ​​a movie on a weekend with a loan camera. Being in the entertainment industry I can judge a decent movie and this one deserves to be shouted or discarded. My advice, stick to a classic like the 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10, even 1 is a good producer because this movie BLOWS. (Under the limit of what sucks) Manufacturers must stay with their daily jobs. If you see the movie, be honest in your posting, it seems to have been hyped and inflated by a few. There are a couple who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly. Sorry, but I have to say this is one to be skipped.
