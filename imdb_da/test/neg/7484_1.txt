It's not often I feel strong enough to write something about a movie. However, this was simply the worst movie I've ever seen. At best, the performance was ridiculous, at worst they were good, there is no other word for it, terrible. Especially the leading woman, who is random sexual coming, must be seen and heard to be believed. In fact, the plot is unclear, the dialogue shaking and the characterization ... there are none. I'm surprised it's not an Alan Smithee movie. I cannot emphasize this strongly enough ... avoid at all costs. How do movies like this ever made? This is no budget film production at its very best.
