Only three words are really required for this review: Piece of crap. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed watching the comic book as a kid, you'll find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor. Yes, they use all the names and catch phrases. Even the name of the dog "Shoeshine" (in the reference to the dog is "Shoeshine Boy" in the comic). They are called Polly's love interest, but she doesn't miss Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son kill me to see this. They should have drugged me to see it. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was spoken by Wally Cox, the ultimate geek. This one is pronounced by a person with a "smart allck teen who knows more than all the adults" setting. As an independent movie, it's terrible. As a tribute to Underdog, it is even worse. It's not a tribute. It's not a story of the story. It's not an update of the story. It is only an attempt to redeem a known title and create merchandising. Next time I go to the store, I fear I will see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. McDonald's and Burger King have probably fought over the child's meal rights for this. <br /> <br /> However, the worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. THEY EXAMINED THE THEME SONG TO RAP (read it with a quiet "C" at the start)! Great, now that we have to destroy something, let's go all the way. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I left. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local 12 plex and found out that they opened it for the first day and first showed up in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four outside stadium seats). Even the theater people knew that it would be garbage! Save your money on the tickets and invest better by going out and buying the original series on DVD. It becomes more entertaining and has better production values.
