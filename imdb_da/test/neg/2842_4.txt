The best thing I can say about this porn horror movie is: boobies boobies boobies! <br /> <br /> Besides that, this movie is made by a Hindu / Indian guy with some background in porn movies or such. <Br /> <br /> Plot: The Talk-Show host and boyfriend are stalked by a psychopath who's overwhelmed by the homeless minds and takes it out, you guessed it, beautiful estate agents ladies! (films like these are why the 80s slasher films got a rope for misogyny) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a Slasher but has the same kind of obscenities and stereotypes: the stupid robbers, the villain is a old white man and the women are busty babes. <br /> <br /> If you like porn horror, it's your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans are going to see her boobs in a second or two)
