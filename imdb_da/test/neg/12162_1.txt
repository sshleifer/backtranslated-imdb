First and foremost, the nature of the film is beautiful and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and camels, but it is all about what was Mongolian in it. Oh, Gone is played by a Mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. But she is beautiful, which solves a little lack of performance on her side. But I completely failed to understand what was meant by this painful to see a piece of 1.30 hours of imagination created by Mr.Bodrov. The reason was completely lacking in a sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was almost no history, just a series of loosely bound scenes with a bunch of guys in "Mongolian" clothes and spoke some kind of pidgin that would sound like Mongolian. Most actors were either Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia, and there were many disturbing pathos about what it is to be "Mongolian". The dialogue is primitive and the scenes of dialogue are slow. The fighting scenes are ridiculous. All the supernatural pathos are paralyzed and of course are only there to compensate for the lack of history. The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and when he looked at him, one would not get an idea of ​​how that person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. He looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> And I won't even start with the subject of the historical relevance of this movie play. To see Chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave, to see his first two children born from other men to see his wife sell himself to the Tangut merchant ... my blood starts to boil. And where is the beautiful story of the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? You could make a great movie out of it. Where is the story of Temujin's rise? From his childhood, about his relationship with his family with his brothers, how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies in his family? where is van khan, who has helped him a lot? where is the portrayal of life in the steppe, the life of the nomads, their traditions, their relationship with the other nations around them? Where is the development of the characters? We completely fail to see what led Temujin along with Jamukha and what brought them apart and most importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast without wealth and military power, managed to unite the Mongol tribes and create such a organized and effective war machine that crushed a nation after another and created the largest country empire in history. All of this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't see anything in Bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.
