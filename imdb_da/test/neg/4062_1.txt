The plane is a 747 Jumbo. The cockpit is located on the upper deck of a 747. In the film, pilots do not lead up the stairs in the first class cabin to reach the cockpit. They go to the front of 1. class cottage and through doors into the cockpit. What a gaff !!! The front of the first class cottage has a wardrobe for jackets and a TV screen. Besides it is radar dome. Before the start, a 747 is shown to start the taxi to the runway. At start, the aircraft is shown to have only two engines. Area 747 has four engines. Who was responsible for the continuity of this movie? In the early part of the flight, the front of the plate suddenly contains restrooms - another farcical fork !!! Then the front of the plane is backwards and vice versa. At this point, I stopped to see. Absolutely rubbish !!!
