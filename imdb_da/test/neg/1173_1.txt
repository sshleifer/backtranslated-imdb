I made a review of this director's fictional recreation about BTK. I had also seen this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This movie was horrible and this director is unlikely. I do not understand how he finances these films. They are terrible. I have decided to make sure I check who the author, director and producer are, and if the director's name pops up, I won't waste my money. There is nothing worse than renting a movie on a Friday night, which makes the popcorn, and then you realize that you have been pushed by creative art on the cover of the movie box. Stay away. So I guess I have to do some things to fill the lines? I've always checked IMDb for reviews before, but I don't think I anymore. It's ridiculous. I have been corrected in my reviews too many times. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
