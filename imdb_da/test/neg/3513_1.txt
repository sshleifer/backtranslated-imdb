Stupid, pointless movies should appeal to Southern Rednecks, teens with IQ's limits on retardation and the average Bush supporter. Noble Willingham plays the lead in this simplistic script for what it is and uses a generous dose of MFers, eff this and eff and SOBs. The end, which I expected to "save" this hollow story was the biggest letdown, so I hung out and wondered why "? It's a story of cat and mouse or more like Bully vs. Sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you like to hear the phone ring every 2 minutes and constantly curse and scream during this 123 minute section of dumpster drops.
