It's great to see Julie Andrews try an equally dramatic role here - something she hadn't done for a while - but her character of Judith (wise they aren't trying to transfer her as a 'Judy') has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle, and Andrews creates "adult" as any other actress would interpret frigid. It's a surprisingly bland drama in Barbados, involving Omar Sharif (not the most lively man around - not even in 1974!) Hoping to make Andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the magical bedroom. Unmemorable excursion has some camp values: James Bond-like credits at first are a cheesy hoot. As for Julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but it doesn't do much for the audience or for the movie. Blake Edwards pushes the freakin 'thing like a funeral. * from ****
