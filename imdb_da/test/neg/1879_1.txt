Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst shortcomings of the Mexican cinema, a rare experience today. <br /> <br /> It's pretentious: it wants us to think it's deep, just because a scene is out of focus, another is pseudo-surreal, another player with Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes the tradition of laughing grin, the edition is fragmented and it is so solemn. <br /> <br /> It has a weak script: the main story hardly evolves, so it has other three smaller, unnecessary stories stuck in it. They are only good at making the movie last longer. <br /> <br /> Most of the play is bad. A true experience, remembering that many of the most well-known Mexican actors were cast. There is an abuse of unnecessarily foul language. To the point that the character of Paloma, which symbolizes the dreams of a child's freedom, uses it all the time. It's homophobic. Eduardo Palomo's character is the most sad and punished representation of a transsexual I've ever seen. It is very boring. I ended up envying the people who left the theater before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever it tries, it's been done better in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words, "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
