Among the many accolades here for this production was an individual whose comments asked if he was the only one (who was not so enthusiastic about it) - that is, giving this movie 3 stars. But the comment continued to indicate an overall taste of the story and other production of the same. Well, this person is not the only one who did not like this production (including me!) But I participate company with him / her. If you put a gun in your head and asked me to choose to shoot me or look at this flick again, I would definitely see it - but I would probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I would very much prefer to be locked into solitary confinement, or to see paint dry on a wall, though. Moreover, I will not see this story again, anytime, anywhere or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's "pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo" and this is one of them for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in my favorite movie, "Long Hot Summer," and while she wasn't a big fan of the show, she enjoyed "Murder, She Wrote." But here - I didn't just care about the story or other aspects, but I found Angela's trembling, squawking, singing and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the most honorable presence in any movie (or presentation in other media) I have ever experienced. It was like an endless continuation of Audrey Hepburn's straight "over-top" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier parts of "My Fair Lady." But that was the case for the plot, presented with light, comic effect and (merciful) card. Ruthlessly, it was anything but short, and for me it seemed as if it had gone for approx. 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of "relativity" in the workplace.) If I hadn't been with friends with the need to remain, MY view would have been short. However, I laughed at the episode "Seinfeld", where Elaine pisser everyone because she tells them how much she did not like "The English Patient." My friends saw me in the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie. Give me some to pull fingernails high over a chalkboard anytime instead.
