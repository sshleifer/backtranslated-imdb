Don't take this movie seriously, hire it with some people who want to play the Mystery Science 3000, and you'll probably laugh at your ass. The evil guys are not so scary, it's funny, it's like a 7th grade guy with a seal in a scarecrow, standing up. The action is fun. I occasionally love self-confidence with a bad horror movie and it really made me giggling. I recommend it on this background. Of course, recreational drugs will increase the experience. Oh, there is a nude group swimming scene that will allow for some star dust on the 5 star system. The token black man is badly injured, but continues his fun and uses the damaged body part easily. Enjoy this complete and complete disgrace to film.
