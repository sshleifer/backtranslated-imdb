The detonator is set in Bucharest, where a form of ex CIA government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked a dealership named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), but it goes wrong, and Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for it US government. After a great shooting, most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni, whom the local Romanian police force is dissatisfied with, and the chief man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the United States while protecting a woman named Nadia Cominski ( Silvia Colloca) also sent back to the US. However, it turns out that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru and his football club, which owns the boss Jozef (Tim Dutton) who needs her to conclude an agreement on a nerve gas bomb that they intend to launch in Washington killing millions of people ... <br /> <br /> This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong & The Detonator beyond any shadow of doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the washed action movie star club Referring to generic action films in Eastern European locations, yep Snipes has joined such fixtures as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a little credit when he lasted a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004), which is still fresh in a lot of cinema's thoughts (every movie he made the page has gone directly to DVD) but it should happen sooner or later, as many of the names I have mentioned Snipes have lived up to the reputation of a couple of fantastic films. If you look at his career, he has been in worse movies, the good ones. Like the latest films from JCVD ​​& Seagal, the Detonator is quite terrible. The manuscript by Martin Wheeler is as predictable, boring and by-numbers as something out there. The detonator is the kind of movie you expect to watch on a fuzzy cable TV channel playing at 2 am. The detonator is chock full of clichés, Snipes is forced to a situation where he has to protect a woman and initially they do not like each other, but ultimately they are in love, showing his closest friend at the CIA to be traitor to the unpleasant the book's boss, who no one likes, turns out to be a pretty decent guy, Snipe's character is allowed to run around in Bucharest, shoot and blow people up as it doesn't matter, and he is never arrested, the action is boring And forgetful, the bad guy owns a football club, so there are lots of annoying football terminology and there aren't even fun lines. <br /> <br /> Director Leong does nothing for lively things, the detonator looks cheap with a billiard where the two cars never seem to get over the 30 mph mark. Ok the action scenes are relatively well staged, but they are few and far between & completely forgettable in a 'bad guy shot at Snipes & misses, in return Snipes shoots at bad guy & kills him' kind. There is a half decent car accident and explosion, but very little else. It seems that some of The Detonator were shot in a Romanian football stadium, I think I'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes instead of this movie. With an assumed budget of about $ 15,000,000 The Detonator is reasonably well made, but not so much really happens. Seen & filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The play isn't that big, Snipes just doesn't seem interested and feels like he's just there for the money I don't blame him at all. <br /> <br /> The detonator is yet another bad clichéd action movie starring a has been an actor and set in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony continue to do these things? Don't recommend there is much better action ticket out there.
