I bought this movie for 99 cents on K-mart several years back (along with "Hawken's Breed") to find something with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is definitely worth it. It wasn't. "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought it below) was a bit over "Hawken's Breed" (IMBD rated at 2.4), but not enough to let myself keep it in the house. I threw both movies in the bin. This thing fails on so many levels, it's hard to narrow it down, but let's just say it's foggy, unbelievable, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even in 100 minutes, too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this show looks really bad on his CV.
