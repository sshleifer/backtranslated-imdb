I found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes. jones was a strange child and is seriously messed up! According to my memory, which could be wrong, was he only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** Why did he leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls sweeping over boys for some time? and the cowboy who lives under jones scares me how he knew what happened in the apartments, did not float past me for a moment. I do not understand his thinking about the girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and it was quite clear that she wanted to be more than friends with him. I really can't find this movie fun or artistic or dramatic or anything I found to be stupid and a complete waste of time (D-F +)
