I just went to see this movie with a friend. I looked quickly and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting. We came out the movies didn't feel very sure if we didn't like it. <br /> <br /> The action was good enough and connection with characters was OK. The protagonist, I thought, acted much like someone like Van Helsing. Yes it was pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> But the plot I felt was used from other movies. The script was a little weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the protagonist says "Oh my good" every time. <br /> <br /> The special effects worked well, but (sorry for this spoiler) the main monster at the main climate reminded me a lot of Balroken out of the Lord of the Rings. Overall, the movie was ok, but I felt it was already done. Go and see buy all the funds, but don't expect too much.
