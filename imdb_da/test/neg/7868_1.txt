Target is the story of a special agent who, after executing orders to murder Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of the American "films for men who love thoughtless nationalist super-patriotic crap films") returns To find out what his ex-wife and two children are taking hostages. Charlie Snow has just a few hours to do what the terrorists tell him to get them back. <br /> <br /> This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And if it hadn't been for a person I actually know (and probably mistakenly) take it out of the video store, I would never have seen this gigantic pile of waste initially. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like any generic action movie story I've ever seen before. In fact, this is the kind of thing they spoof on different shows, it's so bad it is. I expect half in the Living Color 'Homey the Clown' for Mad TV's Will, Sasso makes his Steven Segal impression to bust on the screen halfway, reminding that this was just an exaggerated action movie, but now ours characters here to forge how ridiculous it really is. There were not even good fighting sequences or action sequences. By the way that is played out, you wouldn't even think anyone was kidnapped, that there were any terrorists, or that there was anything distant interesting. <br /> <br /> Not only is history completely and completely uninteresting, the play is such a terrible tree. Just see the part where Stephen Baldwin, as former special agent Charlie Snow, speaks to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him they have their wife and they put her on the phone. She says "Charlie, help!" or something thereof. And Baldwin replies, "It's okay, honey" in such a way, you think he read the manuscript and tried to sound the words phonetically. I imagine that despite being such a ridiculously bad movie (one belonging to the bottom 100 on IMDb - a list that they should extend to at least 250 movies and should contain almost every Stephen Baldwin movie), anyone with Some talent has at least made the effort not to hammer it up so much. Anyone. Anyone. I couldn't pass by that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script. Save it is the only person in the entire friggin movie who has some talent (and shouldn't have been in here), Mad TV's Deborah Wilson. <br /> <br /> This was the capital cheese feast. How really embarrassing.
