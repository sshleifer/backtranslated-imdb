This was one of Christie's later stories. Throughout her long career, she was interested in changing narratives and the concept of conflict mediators. Both are basically the same and boiled down to questions about who is controlling or creating the situation. In detective fiction, the game is a matter of conflicting realities. The murderer intends to change the reality to deceive the detective, the author intends to do the same for the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in similar struggles to create what they see. Therefore, her stories often involve a writer. <br /> <br /> In her works she explores every combination of tricks she can think of dealing with this. Along the way, we often have organs that are not the ones they think, and sometimes, and intended victims and such. But the real magic of the books is this notion of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here's a dead man. Well, sometimes it happens, but not so. It's as if the author was the famous Mr. Rafiel. This is especially sweet for Marple readers who remember this same character from "Carribean Mystery", which in a way was also framed by his nephew. In this story, Rafiel was history's carrier to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series have an almost skewed commitment to using another creative team on each one. Sometimes it produces bland work. Bertram's episode was pretty brilliant. This is the most lavish of the party and has an active camera. But, unlike Bertram's work, it has nothing to do with history. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and captures only because it can. The Citizen Kane quote at the beginning was a little too literal and silly. This story is good, but the adapter took some very critical things out, and the irrelevant camera irritates. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
