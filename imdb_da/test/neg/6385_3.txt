Well ..... scare this is not, but ....... !!! ??? A horrible low low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind, sort of ... so quite charming and fun to see ... at least on my tv set !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... says .... horrible, I give up ... just can't make any "more beautiful" similarities to this blurry movie. Everything is sooo wrong that I just have to catch up with it in my movie collection along with .... Death in Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue Velvet and The Good, Bad, Owl ... Real! ! ?? People with a little talent to add gory bets or sexy events to movies they buy other people should choose this movie right away .... It's probably a fat lil 'ol' gold mine waiting here, oh maaaannnn !!!! !
