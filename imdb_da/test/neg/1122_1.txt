When I found out, there was a Christmas holiday 2, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and looked at it as soon as it came through the letter box. I love all the national lampoons movies with Chevy Chase in it, and I bet he was glad he wasn't in this one! I couldn't believe how bad this was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoons movie, but believe me it is! . This movie probably looked like a good idea on paper that had cousin Eddie as the protagonist, he began to get on his nerves early in the movie and became completely unfunny at the center of the movie and at the end of the movie I had gone brain-dead and couldn't remember what happened! .
