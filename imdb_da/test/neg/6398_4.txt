"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy 80-style, with more than one eye full of sex over a 101-minute run. <br /> <br /> The reason concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of the same prospect. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter by their side. Complications are stopped when one of them becomes involved with the daughter of another. <br /> <br /> This potential riot of a story is pretty fun, and there are some good lines, but it never gets really fun as it could. Any attempt to seriously deal with the moral problem does not work either, and perhaps the director Donen must have attached to the situation of humor. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, but what really destroys it is Michelle Johnson's horrible performance as the naughty little temptress Jennifer. Whilst using her body to the full, this is all she has. Michelle's acting skill leaves much to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
