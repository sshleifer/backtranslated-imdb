Someone remembers the first CKY, CKY2K etc ...? Back when it came to making crazy, cool things, Bam Margera looked like a douchebag, spoiled by the 5-year-old super / rock-star wannabe. <br /> <br /> The show used to be amazing, but Bam's fame and wealth have made him believe that we now enjoy him acting childishly and idiotically, more than real cool stuff that used to be in ex. CKY2K. The trades are so repetitive, there is nothing new, except annoying stupidity and repeated comments ... The only things we see are Bam Margera, so busy showing us how much he doesn't care how much money he has or whatsoever. <br /> <br /> I really don't have much left to say except, give us back CKY2K, because Bam sugar .. <br /> <br /> I enjoy watching Steve-o, Knoxville etc. a thousand times more .
