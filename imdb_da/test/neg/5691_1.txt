In a world where people can live forever, you use the whole movie that wants them to die. First of all, if you insist on watching this movie, you first have to break two things, don't worry about missing a plot, hell, they don't even speak for the first 70 min of a 87 min movie after you have beaten the sound of you must now rave quickly forward, until the main chicken dies, do not worry yourself, even if you are aware, you will not know why or how she died. When you get to the "good part", take it off dumb. Oh, how would you know the good part, wait for an elevator scene with two morons in the spacecraft with WWII weapons. These weapons do not work so much until you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag gun and a bandole of CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick that resembles that she was attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "plot", you will wish they went back to not speaking. Of the four people in this movie, none of them can get remote control, not even a little, you get better luck and are witnessing performing in a kindergarten theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the specialty of the special effects, let me just say "Wow", no, you really want to use the whole movie to say to yourself "Where did the movie come to $ 1.8 million! " Seriously, it will leave you in the aa of the extent of the uncertainty. The best "sets" are basic Windows wallpaper backgrounds. The ships are basically flying keys, some are ships that are similar to whales. I have never heard so many words in my life. They have buttons on their wrists (large pedometers) that can put them in "combat mode" and super running mode (making them super blurry). This will seriously drain their electricity reserves, but they find bits of wires to chew on to regain their strength. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth July, I only had sparklers. <br /> <br /> So the plot, as far as I can find, goes something like this "mother" is a spacecraft captain and goes to the desert for a while riding a rocket door. So her daughter, 6000 years in the future (no I do not exaggerate) reminds of her mother's memories through a kind of capsule. Anyways they jabber on for another 10 min and then cause a big bang. Yes the same "Big Bang" that started our solar system. It is explained how she goes back in time or something, it doesn't really matter what happened to me. Roll Credits Seriously, the entire script was merciful on a sheet of paper unless it actually describes some of the terrible battle scenes. After seeing the credits, I have now grinked more than I did the whole movie, the job created as a catering supervisor "galactius sarcophagus" and then the special thanks to George Lucas was just the best. I didn't really expect much for a movie I paid 99 cents for, but seriously some body owed me for this. The most frequent comment was after the movie "I Want My Life Back". You must admire it, but put time and effort into this movie, but seriously, why?
