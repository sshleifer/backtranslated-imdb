First of all, this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it, since I did not understand this terrible story myself. In addition, the unknown caste, led by an actress called Laura Mennell, is simply horrible. Expressions and screams of the character Sara Tobias are ridiculous and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with plays. Last but not least, there are many good reviews about this flick in IMDb as follows: <br /> - Top Notch-Can't wait to see more of the directors' work ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br /> - incredibly shot, incredibly intense ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Not your typical blood and gore, actually better. 7/10 ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on February 13, 2005; <br /> <br /> - as intense as Asian scare! - The author has only one review in IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they parents, family members, friends or people employed by the production to promote this crap? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 ?? A Nova Profecia" ("11.11 ?? The New Prophecy")
