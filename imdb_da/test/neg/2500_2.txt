It's odd, while the movie contains full X-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it should. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists go to an island in the Caribbean to investigate a radioactive accidental incident. Upon their arrival, a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women. It doesn't always seem to work that way. <br /> <br /> Among the black acts we find some lesbian meetings, a three-way male prostitute, various heterosexual links and rape of an already dead body. Although everything is quite explicit, it never gets shock or touch as it is supposed to. As soon as the sex becomes completely pornographic, it just loses its edge; The suspension of disbelief is broken and we are aware that we are just looking at people who have sex. There is some blood and murder, but considering that this is an D'Amato flick, it's really pretty. For a much more rounded experience see the corresponding 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead'. <br /> <br /> 2/10
