Once again, Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any other inspiration than recovering himself. Here we have a mock documentary (like Zelig), the film's structure is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) in the 30s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about a low lifetime (Deconstructing Harry) who thinks Being a genius releases him from being a jerk (ditto). Considering this movie and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's reason for his own actions with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; yes, i was a smoker, but i am a genius so you must love me. Allen has only produced two good films in the last ten years; the fine but exaggerated bullets over Broadway, and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His second effort ranges from small books (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite), to edgy but experimental (House and Wives), to pure drag (Alice, Scenes from a Mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry). His film no longer tries to have a story arc, and his humor seems to be fun fun, not fun. After Deconstructing Harry I stopped watching his movies in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I can stop renting them too.
