I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video "Music". I always think he's funny. (Actually, he really is.) Just last year I always thought about buying a VCD from "Ali G Indahouse". That's why some months later I bought it cheaply and I started to see it. <br /> <br /> But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I expected to be a good ridiculous comedy. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of waste. It really was really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality and very gross humor. It didn't make me laugh either, just a big smile. We certainly hate that movie. Oh, by the way, I plan to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was very different in his movie compared to his television shows - in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really well focused and probably serious about making this flick. Just because there are some sex scenes in it does not mean that it is freaking fun (for sometimes it is too much not so ridiculous). For the first time ever, I was disappointed with him. It made me really sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 over 10. In fact I really want to give it a 0 rating. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I would not recommend to anyone who wants to see good comedies that are not too explicit or terrible.
