I'm at a loss to find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was. The original bid was promising, but in all respects it was horrible. Let's run through the main points. Plot - good first idea but really awful development. There were many points when I thought "no, no one would do anything so stupid". The ending was incredibly anticlimatic. Characterization - all characters were either gentle or grotesque caricatures. I'm trying to think of someone who wasn't - possibly the mother, but that's it. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Direction - totally amateurish. Cinematography - Doubt that they have heard about it. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels are often very poor. I'm totally confused about how this movie has scored so high. It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if not ever.
