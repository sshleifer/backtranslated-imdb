No spoiler is needed to steer clear of this ... Well, bizarre movie. Canada becomes part of the United States. OKAY. So I guess I'm unusual, but I expected something about the consequences of Canada becoming part of the United States. Silly me. Continue on with this movie and you're out to shoot coocoo land. The introductory principle has nothing to do with the rest of the movie where you want (trust me) not to break a squat to any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South must be among the most imaginative series ever. But in this case, Paul Gross, I'm so sorry to say, had no idea about making a coherent movie and wasted many talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
