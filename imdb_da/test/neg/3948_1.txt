The plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus and October) are gathered together at the death of their equally ridiculously named friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decide to divide the property of their late evening. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better way to show their grief than to participate in some virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they discover the connection between the game and the bad ol 'Loomis death. <br /> <br /> Production: This movie is just a new entry into the latest Hollywood craze of low-budget PG-13 horror aimed at depositing at the junior high school crowd. The direction is sloppy to say the least with fast, music video pieces that make the action difficult to follow. The dialogue is so poor that it actually kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this movie, although not entirely original, had some promise. But the poor performance on both sides of the camera makes this a big dud. <br /> <br /> If you ever had a desire to "kill someone in a video game, make them dead in real life" horror movie take my advice and skip Stay Alive for the parent Brainscan.
