We were looking for this hard-to-find VHS after seeing two excellent Merchant-Ivory photos back to back. Knowing it was an instant checkout error, a bug like rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, the very Liberal Agenda goal was to destroy the founders and in fact they had some success in eradicating the founders of many American classrooms, including, for example, New Jersey; whose extermination of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the truth in the NJ School Board and their subversive action. A small part of this was the head of the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connection, ignoring the inconvenient DNA findings that did not support the wacky left agenda. Forget it! They got James Ellis, a writer of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University concluded the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br/> <br /> As for Jefferson in Paris, the liberal agenda begins spinning in the opening scene where James Earl Jones claims to be son of Jefferson. The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true, Hemming's claim would be an insignificant detail in the greater question of Jefferson's long-standing and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands where he secured crucial financial support to America when ours infant country was without funds). Besides Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing else interested in this killing and tortuously boring movie. Some of the other stories are in fact accurate --- adding credibility to hitting the lie - but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Let me not ask why the Liberals laid the foundations for the founding of the founders, for I do not waste time explaining the actions of such people. Don't ask them either; they usually answer such questions with the same answer: "HOLD UP!"
