This whole movie is just so horrible, it's a complete mess. The story is just so stupid I can't believe anyone actually sat down and wrote about this and thought it would make a good movie! The action may be the very best of any b-movie ever made. I've seen a lot of sci-fi type b movies before, and some of them are actually pretty good, some of them, however, similar to Venus - should never have been made. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers just think they put something together and somehow it has on the shelves of a movie store that they have achieved something - that it is good and should be monitored by humans. This is not always true, and certainly not true from Venus. This movie loses on all accounts: horrible plays, stupid plot, very weak special effects, ugly costumes ever, non-realistic dialogue, bad direction, etc. You can just tell this movie took only about $ 20 to make and I can give it for very credit there! I encourage you to stay away from this train wreck of a movie for your own good!
