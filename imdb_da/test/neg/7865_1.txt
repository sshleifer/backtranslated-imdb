* The ELITE sniper team that has deployed 24h or so earlier, instead of digging in and making them invisible, decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes. * When the hero "runs" to save his wife, he actually jumps. * When inside a building and aiming for a goal only approx. 20-30 meters away, the hero uses his reach. Besides the fact that most non-elite soldiers would get the shot from the hip and still hit, there is also the fact that the scope would probably not be able to focus so closely. * There is a satellite that can actually look horizontal in buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest pile of crap I've ever put in my DVD player.
