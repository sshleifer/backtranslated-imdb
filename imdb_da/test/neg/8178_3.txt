What You Need In the course of 'What You Need', each episode since 'The Lonely' had been a winner to some extent. This episode is the first big mistake since 'Escape Clause'. The Serling script is again based on others' material, a brief story by Lewis Padgett. As with 'And when the sky was opened', Serling significantly changed the content, removed a scientist and his machine and inserted an older peddler. <br /> <br /> 'What you need' works best when it's cute. The opening half, where the paddler gives customers in a bar with items to use in the near future, has a gentle charm about what may have been worn throughout an episode, but works well in the timeframe it is assigned. Unfortunately, the main plot that it creates is full of holes in holes. The moment Steve Cochran's performance as a two-bit tug becomes the main focus, the episode falls apart. Cochran is a minor stereotype, and his flat performance highlights this error. His exploitation of the old peddler is dull and predictable, and the revelation that he will murder the old man is completely convincing, making the whole smooth shoe scene seem completely false. Ernest Truex is good as a peddler who brings a magical, mysterious but warm edge to the character, but he is not good enough to help floating script. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. For example, we learn that the paddler's power to give people what they need comes from an ability to look into the future. So how does that allow him to produce a pen that will choose magic horses. It seems that it has to be a little outside his powers. Also for a man who can see the future, the paddler seems surprised to find hesitation waiting for him in his apartment. There are many more gaps that can be selected in 'What you need', but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway.
