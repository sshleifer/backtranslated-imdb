... but I would lie. A relative was a crew member and we had to watch the production of this movie for a few days (and I was an extra). I'm going to die and have a second of the screen time, not that I'm planning on moving to Hollywood anytime soon. I just thought it was great to see how movies are made and be part of it. Plus, I got a copy of the movie when it was finally released. They didn't have a studio background when they made this movie so it was truly independent. Why the writing and the play are so terrible is beyond me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister, so it could be part of it. But the filmmaker was good. :)
