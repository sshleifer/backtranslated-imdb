No matter what other people have said, you cannot review this movie without comparing it to the original. If it existed on its own, it would be a 2-3 out of 5 movie, but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 movies and then has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached these standards. If the movie was a re-treatment or, as in the Apes Plane, a replay of the original, you would be able to watch the movie itself, referring only to the original. Imagine this way, if someone took the model in "Mona Lisa", put her in another way and painted her, you could only compare the framing, concept, etc. to the original, but if someone had just painted her in the original position You have to compare it completely. <br /> <br /> It is said that this film not only fails to be as good as the original, it fails spectacularly, just like it or not, the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten , the recovery was supposed to be a celebration of Hitchcock, but ended up breaking down him and his masterpiece. The degrading aspects of this image were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with whether they acted better or not, it was that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman really didn't understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world, and when he met beautiful Marion and looking at her change, you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination, as he does not really understand sex and his attraction to her, it makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero you are at his side because he is not fully beyond understanding the world and constantly struggling with itself and its 'mother'. In the remake that the whole dynamic is gone, I must admit that Janet Leigh is not my type, but she is very attractive and you can see that Anne Heche is really uninteresting and so Norman finds 'her' Marion attractive is incredible, if you add it to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbation while looking at her and you get a Norman just waiting for a chance to stand out with any naked woman, no matter what she looks like who you feel absolutely no sympathy for , they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting porn mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to suffer and is sad that it is like recreating 'It is a wonderful life' and having the protagonist a pimp, totally degrading. The only other character I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says that the line "he must have noticed my wedding ring", a ridiculous response arises as she totally enjoys herself when Rita says so, it just seems to be plausible, since there really isn't any other reason why anyone would flirt with Anne Heche over her. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite movie all the time, if the movie had been reworked at a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads, and It would have been perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> Hitch famously said the movie would be too big in color and made it black and white to reduce it. This also made the movie more atmospheric and frightening in its own way, and it gave it a beauty that could never be caught in color, and it is a sad claim about how film dictates the public that people have said how the shower scene was more scary in color. (nb before people think 'he can't spell' remember, I'm from England and we spell that color) <br /> <br /> A remake just needs to be what it's done, it's a fake, a complete copy and one very bad about it. I could continue to compare, but there is no point, almost everything is superior to the original. The only thing better is Viggo Mortensen's performance as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him The Stiff behind his back) and Mortensen gives a more credible, if less sympathetic performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors who hold the originals. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie to be labeled "Expensive hostile unsuccessful experiment. Look only if you compare with the original or if the original is unknown to you. But also look original." The movie would have got 3 out of 5 if it was original or a recast, but since it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
