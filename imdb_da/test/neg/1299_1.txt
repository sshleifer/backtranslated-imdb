Oh dear, oh dear! What were they thinking about? Terrible script, terrible acting. I'm not even sorry about the actors ... they took their checks to the bank and smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since when did an air shaft from Charing Cross jump on Bank? Why are vehicles crossing Tower Bridge approaching the city when the wave strikes? Why is Tower Bridge not crowded when the city is evacuated? How does Carlyle dive into a raging torrent .... and survive? I could continue ... and beyond. <br /> <br /> There is no real sense of urgency in the command room. They might as well wait for England eleven to get back on the track after the tea interval at Lords. <br /> <br /> It says something when I wait for adbreaks to learn more about diarrhea treatment with keen expectation. <br /> <br /> Absolutely eerie garbage bin!
