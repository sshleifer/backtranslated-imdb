I stopped watching this movie halfway through. It was just awful! Drilling, constructed subplots. A complete lack of pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback's depiction of Ed Gein. A movie doesn't have to be historically accurate, but Ed Gein's true story is so much more interesting than this three-dimensional melodrama that was completely made for no good reason! Ed Gein as depicted by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadist. The attempts to show the trauma which his mother has inflicted on him are just weak exercises in recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it turned itself up. Fortunately, there is a better movie of this story. 2001's Ed Gein told the story effectively, and offered a couple of real chills when we saw a sick man who had no control over himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein back then, was already famous for remembering another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His movie is the one that sees. Avoid this mess.
