*** SPOILERS *** A warm and sexy Linda Blair as the witch Amelia Reynolds is very sorry for her friend and rival witch over the town of Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia gets her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a promotion at his work with the Giger & Greengrass law firm over the more deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica, has thrown her a spell on Hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up killing himself. <br /> <br /> Larry finds out about Eric's attempt at her best friend Larry's life has a fierce battle with her, causing Erica to fall from the balcony to her death. That's when Larry returns to his former wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things start to warm up, emotionally, and sexually. The evil Amelia tries to get Eric's dead spirit to take over Carol's body and end up killing Larry, as she is responsible for her husband's neck injury, which left him permanently confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Not much of a story, but much of the cheese and soft-core act of bad Larry being manipulated by Amelia through Eric's resurrection, planning to kill him the first chance he turns his back on. Amelia is a little knocked out herself, not exactly who is, and who is not a threat to her. Amelia even gets her bad and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks first to lose him family in a bloody invasion burglary at home, then his mind, being accused by the police as being murderer and finally, life is being blown up by Ameila himself . As he has done to run into Reynold's house, under her control, as sour as a hats trying to kill both her and the lame Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks looked and seemed so strange that you had the feeling that he accidentally went on the "Sorceress" kit and ended up throwing his role as Stan. Without the help or benefits of a script, he improvised himself through and then slowly realized how godly the bad movie really is. Stan gets killed early in the film was a big plus for him as he didn't have to suffer as those of us are looking through the whole mindless and mindless movie. It becomes clear to you as well as it made the decision makers of "Sorceress" that this whole shenanigan on the screen should come to a form of hope and successful completion, and a trick ending is set to finally finish the movie. The ending is about the best, besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-maintained women's caste, one can say about the film.
