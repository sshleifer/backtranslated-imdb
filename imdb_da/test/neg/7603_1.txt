Unfortunately, it's not one of those movies that at least makes you laugh at their incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value at all. It's simply bad. I don't know where to explain how much this movie annoyed me. I think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. It sounds like someone took a simple blow and then for the rest of it, let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it. It's really so terrible and as if that's not enough, there's no scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie you are either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier. Which will at least keep you from falling asleep, as nothing happens in the movie to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad actions, a couple of cheap and unconvincing kills, no story at all (it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make sense) and in the last 30 minutes or so can witness some of the worst "special effects" ever. It's extremely boring. Don't watch this movie! You can do something much more entertaining than staring at a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack sucked?
