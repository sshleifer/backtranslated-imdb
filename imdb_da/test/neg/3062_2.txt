Wow, pretty amazing that something so bad could actually be done. I give this movie a 2 because it is so bad that it has some "car wreck" kind of appeal. It's so bad it's comical, and it has some entertainment value. In addition, there is a bit of free nudity and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where do I start. The play is beyond terrible, it's like watching a high school play being filmed. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad for being forced to make this movie, and her play reflects how happy she is to be in this mess. The rest of the throw is simply silly with the casting of Dan Cortese as an FBI agent cherry on top of this piece of shit. His play actually had me laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> With regard to the manuscript and director C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester, simply be taken out and shot.
