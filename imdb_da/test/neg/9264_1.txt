Well, after the hype around the movie and after Surya has marked the movie as PATH-BREAKING, I went into the theater and expect something big. Boy was I disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characterization of the film is so strange! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic, coo-coo one? And what was the meaning of her standing in the rain with her baby (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgar shot "Maaja Maaja"? Not only was the song not aesthetic, it was just not necessary in the manuscript. UNNECESSARY! Second, the first half had almost no history. The whole of the first half was a TROUBLESHOOTING. Each scene in the first half of the film had no significance as to what ever was in the film's real story. And also how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) change radically all of a sudden? And how did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi live a good life together after six years, even though they were so dissatisfied with marrying each other? And if Gautham loved Aishwarya as he claimed, did he, why did he marry Kundhavi, even though it was the wish of his uncle's death? WHY? It's the question you're still asking while watching the movie! And how fair is the end of Aishwarya? After all, she was Gautham's first wife? Krishna, the film's director, claimed he was working on the film on this movie for two years, but his scripts are full of errors and leave the audience completely annoyed! Third, Krishna's unimaginative images of Rahman's awesome are just disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's editing (usually excellent) sucks the "New York Nagaram" song just! The whole song looked like it was a slide show made on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" Rangoli choir was wasted and shows Gautham PLAYING FOOTBALL !!! Who wants to see the freaking guy playing football under such a beautiful chorus?!? What's more, the whole movie needed only two songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" are just not necessary. Rahman's fine work is simply wasted on a silly movie, directed by an amateur director! Fans of Rahman, you ask why Rahman continues to move to Bollywood. After looking at the way his songs are pictured in Kollywood, why would he like to stay here? What's more annoying is that after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the movie, the song was cut half as really really annoying. <br /> <br /> Surya looks great in his new get-ups, stores them under college scenes and packages in a performance. His expression under all the songs he was mentioned in does not really fit the way the singer sings the songs. Was Jyothika himself appearing in the movie? The only thing she did was CRY! Do you want to call everything that cries acting? One of her worst performances ever! Moreover, her new hairstyle does not suit her. She looked much better at Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. Her costumes under the "New York Nagaram" song are far away. Bhoomika Chawla is just beautiful under the film and makes right to her role. Vadivelus comedy is ANNOYING. When you see him, you want them to slap him in the face. It is Santhanam who is the show stealer during comedy scenes. And why the heck did Sukanya even agree to do such a small role that could have been done by just anyone? And why is her makeup so heavy when she has perfect skin flexion? Music by A.R. Rahman is just wonderful. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" deserve special mention. R.D. Rajasekhar's film is ok and is not as good as his previous movie, although the stage under the "Kummi Adi" song deserves special mention. Anthony's editing is really really disappointing. The film is just as freaking draggy and could be trimmed seriously. <br /> <br /> Krishna's direction just sucks. Dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are just for corny to digest especially the part where Bhoomika praises her love for Surya. The play and script (Krishna) are horibble. The film is moving at the more uninteresting pace ever. And Krishna's script is just filled with inexplicable sub-lists. <br /> <br /> And for the sake of goodness, why was there so much advertising in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you're called. Was the producer of the film (K.E. Gnanavel) low on budget or was he just desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a damp spear. With a title as such, one would expect a heart warming and cooling love story, but what you end up with is a painfully squeezed love story. Really, really disappointing.
