Another winner from the 50's, 60's era, which I love so much for the comic value they give with every show these days. Corman never lets you down with these movies, they take seriously, and they have very low budgets, a recipe for good to see for sure. Ed Nelson a very competent actor began with Corman as well as many other favorites that appear in Superman and many of the Western of the day. The cost is pretty bad, and the sound of strangers speaks well, and it was a bit of it, but it was the beauty of it. Movie making for the love of it, not looking for perfection, just digging the action of doing what it comes through. These movies are fun! Even better is the MST3K version !!
