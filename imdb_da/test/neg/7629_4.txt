This derivative erotic thriller remains monitored mostly, mainly because a viewer is randomly curious about how it will turn out, and because the director, Peter Hall, manages to create a rather warm (and rather bold) sex scene. But the final, but unexpected, is obstructed, and the entire plot (complete with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders) proves to be unbearably clumsy, especially in terms of motivation.
