I'm really disappointed with this job. It is quiet low, stays to repeat, is mostly not exact and sometimes on the verge of being wrong. I think it's made for primary school, especially because it repeats itself over and over while leaving big holes. A young child can actually enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to get a child to appreciate theoretical physics is books such as "A Brief History of Time" or "Tao of Physics". If you are familiar with the subject at a very basic level, you will not get any new information or views from this series. Don't waste your time with it. Nice eye candy dog.
