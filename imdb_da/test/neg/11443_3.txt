I've seen this movie recently, mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this film was made right between her 2 Oscar's award-winning performances, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was horrible, and I'm still back and wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. Scripture is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat credible if one like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit man. The idea that Jodie runs off with Dennis Hopper and his annoying accent was impossible for me to buy. I thought Jodie looked good in the whole movie, which was probably the only reason I saw it all. Maybe parading Jodie around with as few clothes as possible was the only reason why the film was made. I saw a television biography of Jodie, where virtually all her films were commented in chronological order, and this film was the only one ever mentioned. After seeing it, I can now see why.
