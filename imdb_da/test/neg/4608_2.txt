I would have given this movie a 1, but I laughed so hard, so many times that I had to give it a small credit, in the off-off chance the movie was supposed to be fun. A movie so bad, you think chimpanzees wrote it. You want chimpanzees to have written it. Dialogue so blown that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by crossing scenes from Original Carrie (a really good movie) to scenes from this. Like interspersing scenes from taxi driver to baby generations. Don't rent it alone as you won't enjoy the experience. You need someone next to you to confirm the evil you are looking at. Millennium's worst actress goes to poor poor Amy Irving as the stone-assembled, monotonous, catastrophic tree school advisor. This year's worst movie so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
