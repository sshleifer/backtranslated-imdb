This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst Biblical theme movie ever ... Absolutely incorrect, I mean, they have put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They described Lot as a Noah's friend, even though he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, Lot later became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood !!! ??? And what about the merchant coming together on a boat that has moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism ??? And exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic! Mockery and persistent blasphemies one after another, and it goes over and over and ... Movie maker and all contestants have probably secured the front row of hell with this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from This shot because you will save yourself almost three hours in your life.
