I carefully checked if there is another movie called this one and there is not! But I really don't think we all saw the same movie! There is no way! How can you vote more than "1" for this movie ?! The idea of ​​this movie let's say it's acceptable. Oh, and Dan Gordon's (Chris) play is pretty good. But these are the only two things that are acceptable in this project. The others are ... awful? It is a very sensitive word to describe the actors from the other actors, control the (so-called) "special" effects, even the way the crew filmed! I don't even like the way the camera operators moved to record the scenes! This may be the most miserable movie I've ever seen. I really can't remember a movie that is lower than this one ... Maybe there, but ... I don't think so ... Ehh, what is done, it's done ... It's the movie and there is too late for someone to change anything. I voted "1" but my realistic voice starts with a "-" (minus) front ....
