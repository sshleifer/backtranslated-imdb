I loved the blood and doing. That kind of violence is what Alien and Predator movies are, no one is spared. This really answers the question of how it would be as if foreigners were on the ground. The answer to that is simple. We're screwed. The effects were beautiful. Where ever there are any real problems with it. <br /> <br /> 1) The play was terrible on the human karate side, the witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was, which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. The authors could have made SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the Alien and Predator effect, which I thought was done very well for the most part. <br /> <br /> 2) The predator ship's size was much smaller than what it was in the first AvP movie. This I have scratched my head on <br /> <br /> 3) Predators have their mask on while they are still in the ship. This upset people and I can't understand why. It is not a plot hole that most people make it to be. So I tell you that people are quietly fucking down. It is no problem. If it will make you feel better, remember, they had boredom in storage, so it could be a good reason for it. <br /> <br /> 4) The Predator fires its plasma master inside the ship. I thought it was pretty stupid on the Predators section. But then I began to think if it was a younger Predator who panicked. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son approached the crash site immediately after falling several miles away. At least they didn't drill us by showing them running through the forest for 30 minutes. so be happy with it. <br /> <br /> 6) Why only a Predator went? I thought it was strange. But then I thought it was because he thought it was only a Predaly he had to deal with and not an outbreak. 7) Why didn't the predators in the ship destroy themselves? Well if people were attentive, they did, but he was killed before he could fully activate it. <br /> <br /> 8) The unlimited blue melting goo. I thought it was pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) Predator stores evidence with goo but shines a policeman. It was too stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) The black out. Now people came, an Alien and Pred knocked it out on a power plant. <br /> <br /> 11) The Predaly is half face-cutter / queen. This really crossed me. I'm an Alien and Pred fanatic. I know for a fact that foreigners don't do it !! Just as they don't feed like a human, they like to show them in Alien4 !! Out of all the comics, games, books and movies 1,2 and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs close in to the face patch's face scrub, the parasite pops out and kills the host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a predator with a Predator and Runner with any kind of four-legged animal. And then, after living for years, they melt into a Preatorian (a my queen who doesn't lay eggs). I can go on, but I don't want to. But that scene alone ruined the movie for me. If the managers are wise, they will go back and edit it by making a face jam infected by the pregnant women. <br /> <br /> Any way to watch this movie, just watch it for aliens and predators. And when the stage comes up where Predalin infects the pregnant women ... Close your eyes so you don't have to see the insult to the Alien and the Pred universe.
