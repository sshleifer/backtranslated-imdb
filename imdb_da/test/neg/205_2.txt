What a bad movie, the premise was all there, the actors were all there. And yet, a credible plot, a good dialogue, signs to relate to were a little lacking. Typically heist incorrectly went the premise set on the basis of everyman who was shaken by the system. The main character Tye and his little brother have not been successful and their house will be repossessed, together comes godfather Matt Dillon (who does not look much older than Tye so not quite sure how it happened) for rescue with a plan to steal money from an armored car as they work as security guards. Tye has a short flirtation with a conscience, but decides to go with it. And thus, a really horrible hole rides 30 minutes of incredible trash can. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic, but let me point out the big ones: <br /> <br /> Because of Tye deciding to be a good guy, because a homeless guy became security damage, all his close friends including his girlfriend die. His godfather, who is allegedly family and the man who led him into the last minute captain to help him out, dies because of Tye. Time to counteract his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that repossessed his house. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> There are many more, it is unnecessary to say that this movie was tripe, and I really hope nobody else sees it.
