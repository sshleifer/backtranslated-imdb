This was the most awesome horrible movie I've had to sit through. 30 minutes in the movie and I couldn't take more. Seriously, don't bother with this unless you're a sentimental nut job or one of the pseudo-arty types who like this kind of tripe so they can feel more cultured. Drilling, although the play is fine; The child is simply annoying. Some scenes are a little weird with very strange close-ups. I don't know why they made the whole movie black and white, but no matter what effect they hoped to have failed miserably. There was just nothing to look at, and although it's a sad story, supposedly, it's just so stupid that it's hard to feel any sympathy for the characters.
