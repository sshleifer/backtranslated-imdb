Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is kept under the control of Core Trackers, android assassins shipped by the US Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty. The secret service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who established the USCJS), by the Union of Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly tries to enter Phillips into his private circle, but the SS agent starts after seeing Dilly murdered a cold blood UHR agent. Dilly sends Core Trackers to him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first of a series of sci-fi / action hybrids directed by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment, a powerhouse of action films in the 1990s. Other Pepin films include "Hologram Man", "T-Force", "The Silencers" & "Dark Breed". Pepin films typically start with a larger action sequence that lasts approx. 10 minutes before the plot can kick in. The script of this movie has a few plot holes ?? It is never clear what the conspiracy hero is trying to stop is actually. As far as the actor is concerned, Don "The Dragon" Wilson can be tough, but cannot work for prayers with little charisma. His co-stars are much better. The movie's best bet is the action scenes that throw up an impressive artillery fire, a big body and not one, but three moments when a vehicle flies through the air, flips and hits the ground, explodes. The visual effects border on the cheap side & musical score is low key & shrill.
