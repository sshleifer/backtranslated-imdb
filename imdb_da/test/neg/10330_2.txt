Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible I couldn't help chuckling the whole movie in disbelief that I actually looked at something so shit. Ha ha. Sound editing is horrible, they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they are just weird and stupid. The script sucked. The action was horrible, history not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20 year old movie ..... so I give it a bonus point for that. And yes, the music was horrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And submitting these things is such a hassle ..... 10 line minimum ... annoying. Now I know why I couldn't find this movie in the movie store .... I had to buy it offline to see it ... good thing was only $ .58 cents .... even though the shipment was $ 2.59. Oh yes .... I do not recommend anyone to waste their time and money watching this movie ...
