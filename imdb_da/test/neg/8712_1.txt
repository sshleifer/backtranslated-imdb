I almost fell asleep during a screening of this. Of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can't be together and how to go in their separate ways. The male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his "true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they visited, looking for more traces or signs where he can find his love. Meanwhile, he chops with a nasty guy (who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay, and a guy who ends up having a "three-second intercourse session" with him in a back street. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to wonder how movies still play random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a short time for a few seconds, as in this case where the trick hardly has its pants unbuckled before they print three times and miraculously experience orgasm! <br /> <br /> All these random meetings end with the sexual partner and ask him to call them as he discards their phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a short side plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. There is also another short side plot involving a random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times on the bridge from her window. And there is also a more brief page plan with him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not advised on his relationship with that person. None of these things are really connected to each other, to show us just how lost and confused this young man really is. He seems to be living life as a ghost. There was a good scene throughout the film that involved him rummaging through a work sale looking for a particular record with the world's most boring song on it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamy, but sitting in the theater for almost two hours watching this drive will look more like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I found the end to be confusing when I was not sure Is the young man dead and gone to heaven? It would have been a good reward to end the misery that both the audience and the protagonist had to endure in this pointless trip. But as this is an "independent film", movies with endings like these should encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are searching for nudity, there are only short scenes, and most of them are recorded in such a way that everything that suggests is artificially hidden in the shadows. In other words, don't waste your time with this one. <br /> <br /> My rating - 2 out of 10
