Sadly in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career increase for Connery was not that neither the heaters would have it. Overlap by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this movie and "Robocop 2" is evidence that Irvin Kershner had no real control over "The Empire Strikes Back." Connery hadn't been in a fight since he bowed from Bond in 1971, but it didn't bring him back. "Octopussy" was released several months before this movie, and it became widely used. Imagine it - a Roger Moore Bond not only better than a simultaneous Connery release, but overwhelming it (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopussy" is on par with "2001." <br /> <br / > worst Bond theme song, even worse than "The Man with the Golden Gun", meaningless scenes that draw immeasurably (with the worst example being the ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHERE USER?!) and the most horrible collection of non-talent as far as the fantastic "Bond Girls" goes. Is anyone serious about Kim Basinger being attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never get dates that looked better than she does in this. And Barbara Carrera - Just stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her to wrap around all the time did not help her out, she is the seedling that would be the very impressive "Onatop" which was about the best function of "GoldenEye," but it does not matter when you are struggling hard through the nne movies. <br /> <br /> Casting Search Is like a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction of Connery and he should have is terribly bad. Two actors never seemed to lump together - deliberately the scene where, in order to escape the local authorities, they beat them to their boxers and let themselves be exercised - I can't imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitless be laughing.
