Apparently, SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie in which Julius Harris played a role. I haven't seen all his movies, but Julius Harris was in many good movies and I remember him best from "Live and Let Die" where he played Tee- Hee and filled with Voodoo references, something common here in South Florida! I have always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystery, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona! He has an amazing mystery and occult style, and his role in this movie is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a bit of a comedy. SPOILERS: Three kids that are like being fired from the cast by THE LITTLE RASCALS are killed by a neighborhood hoodlum that looks like he's fired by Cast FAME! or who dances at DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN TIRE. In other words, these children give LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the Mortuary-Funeral Home, cuts off the three children's heads (and no one notices) and then leads them to his Condominium Unit, where he has a huge boiler of boiling liquids. The three heads are thrown together with some herbs, spices and Voodoo items. At one point, Mr. Harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he wastes his blood on them and they come to life as head of speech! They can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes and exact revenge from the evil deaf people. They usually look nice fun around, but the effects are not bad. For some reason, one of the children always has a knife in his mouth, and he uses it to cut people's neck and cut holes in the deck. This movie is weird and funny, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell, and Meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangster. Strange movie.
