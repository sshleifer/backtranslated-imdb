SPOILERS FOLLOW - and I haven't even seen it. <br /> <br /> Let me guess ... the murder is related to the evil real estate developer who wants to develop the river, and Dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar dastardly plot. If anyone is seen, it can tell me if I am half right, you have saved me the time it can take to see something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to remove both of these film and its enthusiastic reviewers. On the other hand, it sounds * exciting; but if it was any good, would it * really be given away with a Sunday foot? And what kind of track record does Foley have at least? <br /> <br /> ... As a public service, I managed to get through it. It's worse than "swept away". Really. I've read stories from eight-year-olds with more drama than this. Really horrible. And I was half right.
