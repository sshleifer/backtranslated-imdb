From time to time, it is highly advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent films about the harsh life of ordinary people in order to recall the privileges and pleasures they have had since the beginning of mankind or even before? in comparison to the complicated and hard work that ordinary people have to endure every day since the aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first movie directed by Dame France Marion, which will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks in general to her work as a scriptwriter; better for her, certainly because her career as a film director does not impress this German counter. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford) a beautiful Italian girl living surrounded by a "quaint gossip" (an important difference between upper and lower classes; aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "quaint luxury" ??); she has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all she gives him in return is indifference. Fate begins to work hard, and soon war is declared, and Lady Angela's two brothers are using and in the next wheel both are dead. But fate is even cruel, and Dame Angela falls in love with ?? a german !! And to make matters worse, she does not know that her teutonic sweet is a spy and that the light signals she sends to him every night from the lighthouse, she maintains that it is a love signal, does not mean "Ich lie dich" men " Sink Any Damn Italian Boat At Sea "?? Fortunately for Dame Angela, soon her sweet German spy will be found by the neighbors in her house, where she hid him (a strange fact, because it is not an easy task for a German to go unnoticed?), But the German spy prefers to die before being caught by these Italians. From the German love, a Half-Teutonic baby is born (the evil Destiny at full speed ??), but a greedy neighbor who has a definite idea of ​​motherhood will carry her son with the consent of a Catholic nun who has taken Trentes advice for extremities ?? a fact that will put Dame Angela at the head of insanity. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dame Angel's secret admirer has returned from the war, and one can think that Lady Angela's sad life will eventually improve. a huge mistake because Destiny has in the store for her that the returning soldier is blind. But as they say in Germany, it can be a blessing in disguise and finally, Dame Angela will regain her son and begin a new life with her blind sweet in a poor Italian village in what it should be a happy end to the common people. <br /> <br /> When this German counter said before, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion to continue her career as a screenwriter, as, as can be seen in "The Love Light," she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, yes wohl! ?? But a completely different topic is to lead movies and her quiet debut lacks feeling and rhythm despite Dame Pickford's attempt to involve the audience with her many disgrace. The non-existent film story causes indifference in the spectator, making it the kind of movie where only Dame Pickford herself gives the interest and not her circumstances. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I must temporarily take my vacation because this German Count will send Morse signals from Schloss North Tower to one of his teutonic rich heirs.
