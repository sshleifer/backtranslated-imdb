By far this must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I see pretty much every movie that goes on at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you in as much excitement as seeing paint dare to let you down even more miserably. If you want to feel that you're just wasted, what seems like an eternity on the worst movie ever created, then even see this movie. I have to scream at least 900 times from the idiotic terms. If I had 4 hands, I would give this movie 4 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe that the only ones who want this movie are those with horrible morals.
