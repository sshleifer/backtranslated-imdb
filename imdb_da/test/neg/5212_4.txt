I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and I can't believe this is Sweden's official submission to the 79th Academy Awards to be considered best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony last year also had Sweden's official submission for best foreign films with Zozo. I wasn't personally a fan of Zozo, but at least it had some production value to it. This could have been shot as a high school movie project. As a short film it may have worked, but as a feature film it is as lost as it is characters. This is a story of twenty-five some friends living in a small Swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long-standing childhood. In fact, Falkenberg is not like some distant northern Swedish villages. It is a popular summer holiday with a population of city and urban areas of almost 40,000 and is located between two large southern coastal towns in Götborg and Malmö. The characters are nice enough guys, but if they were high school, children with a gloomy or confused attitude to what they are planning to do with their lives, I would no doubt worry about them more. However, they are far beyond the point where they have to make plans to deal with adulthood. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, then there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just cycling, drinking, smoking pot and occasionally painting a house. Maybe if they are connected to a girl or two in their circle of friends, some girls are absent in this movie altogether, which makes no sense. Jesper Ganslandt makes his direct debut, and he wrote the film together with the film photographer, where I use the term loosely, Fredrik Wenzel. the play is not that bad. I'd give this a 4.5 out of 10, but despite being subject to consideration for the Academy Awards, I wouldn't recommend it.
