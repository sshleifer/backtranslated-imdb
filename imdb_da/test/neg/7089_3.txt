Just listen to the Broadway cast album and to Barbara Harris and John Cullum's voice that do wonders for the wonderful Lerner and Lane score. Then with the beautiful cast shot in mind, watch the movie, with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand read his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chainsaw could not cut through it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introduction part of the title song. Listen as he sings / says: Could anyone among us have a curl or a clue what magical feats of faithful and voodoo you can do? (One part summarizes the problem arising from casting "name stars" into movie musical rather than the appropriate talent for the different roles.) I can just see Rex Harrison coming in on stage and suggesting Montand also be able to learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
