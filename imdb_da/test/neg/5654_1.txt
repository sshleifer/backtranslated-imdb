iCarly is all that is wrong with the world. All the main characters, but Carl's brother and Freddy are morally bankrupt. Sam harms other people on whim. She breaks a childhood and he is forced to pay a $ 100 to fix it and all she says is "Tough luck" and continues to smash Freddy's cell phone. She just caused at least $ 300 damage and she's more focused on getting some food. What the heck?. The only time she's all felt guilty is when she made fun of Freddy on the show. And that's just because Carly keyed the boy out of her. <br /> <br /> Carly is "I am perfect, all I do is good." type of girl. Everything she does is to her advantage and she is often only shown to have repentance for herself. What's worse, she calls on Sam's shit. Sam destroys some of Freddy's clothes? She laughs. Sam destroys a child's characters? She removes it. <br /> <br /> Let me not even start with humor. It laughs the track played at every moment. Sam: He's not so hot Carly: Yeah, he's Sam: Yeah, you're right * INSANE REVIEW * <br /> <br /> shows that humor is breaking down others and saying unclear words and occasional handling about trivial issues using similar phrases. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the "super cool special techno effects" they do, they can be done in Windows Movie Maker.
