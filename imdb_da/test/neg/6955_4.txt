A vehicle for Michael Caine. It's pretty well written, and there's something OK that works in it, but it's really a mess - not enough, not scary enough. It's a flaccid modern cockney thriller. I like the premise - that even in the British moral hinterland in East London, people do it for the right reasons. A surprising result to the first real fight Caine's old-school Billy Shiner has promoted his inflames paranoia. The other half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the result of the first. My biggest disappointment was in Director John Irvin's inability to do more of the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant / branch replacement Frank Harper. Harper's, a British Tom Sizemore, understands his role well while those around him seem to have ignored it. Pity. 4.10
