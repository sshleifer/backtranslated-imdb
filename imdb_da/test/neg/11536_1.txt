I know when you buy a used (oops, excuse me, previously seen) DVD for $ 5.99, you shouldn't have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this bad box. <br /> <br /> I want to give manufacturers credit to face a complex challenge for the viewer. . . to determine which is the worst, the actor, scripting, the camera works, the special effects. . . they are pretty much related to terrible. Oh, it has the absolutely WORST crashed car accident ever used in a movie anywhere. Now all this is quite seriously ridiculous for a movie fan who proudly has the 'Police Academy', 'Naked Gun' 'National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon' and a host of other campy disks in his collection. But at least these people know that the tongue in question must be planted firmly in a cheek, the PW cast, unfortunately the tongues use in an attempt to deliver inane dialogue. And even though it is almost out of my faith, the characters of the movie seem to think they could actually do something of value. A backlog surgeon would be ashamed to release this mess. <br /> <br /> Oh. . Lucky I bought the worst video ever made at the same time. "" Brother's Demon "... maybe the name should have given me a tip.
