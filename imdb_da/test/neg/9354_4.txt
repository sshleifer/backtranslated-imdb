'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more a love story between Helen and Paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wants nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different depictions of the characters, but in this they are simply hopelessly in love.) The movie is pretty slow in some places, but the struggles and details of the landscape are done pretty well. There are also some good performances. I thought the slave girl did a particularly good job, and she was one of the most well-liked characters. All in all, this is a good fit if you can look beyond the slowly moving history of places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue. In my opinion, a perfect Iliad movie version has not yet been created, but this one is entertaining and has some good bits.
