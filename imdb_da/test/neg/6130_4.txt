Before I move on, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had time, I could have considered seeing it every week if you could only see how the season played out. However, it was very clear to me from the start that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" just doesn't "fit in". Martha Stewart made a career as a happy homemaker, a domestic diva of likes like Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only since her scandalous legal problems and subsequent imprisonment that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Well, she was convincing for a while, and this whole series is the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Should she get so cold and hard? Shouldn't she? <br /> <br /> But the truth was when Stewart got out of prison, she tried for a public comeback, although it was certainly justified, never to seize the viewers' interest for very long. Perhaps a true comeback would have worked if she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after she was often removed. Instead, she kills deep into the overkill with 2 series at one time, the other is her syndicated daytime series Martha, like her old show, but more common with famous guests such as Bette Midler. Even at her top, Stewart was never the mainstream, so it's too much to ask that American audiences immediately accept her foray for reality TV. Maybe America wants to make a comeback on his own rather than be the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The show was basically a tired retread of Trump's "Apprentice" who still has my interest, depending on the tasks, thrown, and Trump's dismissal decisions (often controversial - probably for that reason). The letter was certainly not clich√©, but at least uncomfortable. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" - mentioned in the bulletin board on this site - is particularly disturbing. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired to deal with Stewart's prison time honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone looking at can tell that she is basically trying to show a show that be this lovely businesswoman. Again never mainstream, missing Stewart's agreeability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic "toughness" of Donald Trump. Yes, it can be a gender-based assessment of her character, but I think it is more about the nature of her business. It comes as a shock that Stewart has been fired, but I wonder if they really always intended to last only one season?
