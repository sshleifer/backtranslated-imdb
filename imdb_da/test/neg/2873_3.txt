wow ... I just watched this movie ... American people have this stereotypical attitude to Hindi movies as ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story .... Its pathetic, how far away from the truth it is. This movie simply exposes the stereotypical western view of Hindi movies. Terrible play, horrible direction, horrible filmography. And all this by a Hollywood director. Most Indian movies today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of shit. Indian film (not just Hindi) also covers a variety of topics. Like most other Hollywood movies these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of another country where the truth is thrown out of the window. This is a very NOT recommended movie. Instead, watch good Hindi movies like black friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother india, lagaan ... These movies are what true Indian movies are all about.
