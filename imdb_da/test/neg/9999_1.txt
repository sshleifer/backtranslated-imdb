When all we have is more, there are a lot of reality TV shows with people who are fooling themselves, no matter what it is, if it's too fat or can't sing or cook, because I know Hollywood has gone out of original ideas. I can't remember a time when something original or intelligent came out on television in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with seeing pimples fooling on themselves? I would have thought that these types of programs would have run full circle, but every year they come up with something new that is more strange than before. OK, so people in this need to lose weight ... most Americans need to lose weight. I just think that we all all to some extent enjoy seeing people humiliated. Perhaps it makes us feel better when we see someone who looks like a jerk. I do not know, but I just wanted something intelligent would come out that does not offend your intelligence.
