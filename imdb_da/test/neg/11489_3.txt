When I saw that the icon was on TV, I was surprised. I know the first clue as to where it was going was that it was on the Hallmark Channel - must be said - sorry !! I was hoping when I saw that FF itself was Exec Producer, but so very quickly that the only real way that the TV movie and book were the same was in name and character names. The TV plot was a ho-hum to say the least, but I agree that in itself the action was worth 3 stars. In my personal opinion, Mr. Swayze has portrayed a valid monk, but I think that to make the justice of the film would have been a much longer movie, and I do not think Hollywood would have gone for the plot of subterfuge discredit. An example is the horrible movie version of the sum of all fears - should I say more?
