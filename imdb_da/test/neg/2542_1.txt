I just finished watching this movie and for me .... it takes ages to finish because it's so boring ..... and the story is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> now ... where do I start .... O .... the movie is called "sink by japan" .... yes yes ... it shows that Japan actually drops, but the action is very poor. Compared to the movie "the day after tomorrow" I would have rated it at least 8/10. "The sinking of Japan" does not show much about the disaster that actually takes place right in front of our eyes. there is not much excitement at all ... boring ... all i can say ... another point ... i would recommend this movie to get a better title ... maybe something like "romance in the sink of japan" because this movie has lots of chats (waste of time ... speaks nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring and has gone too long ... honestly .. i get almost frustrated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... this movie does not show enough details about the disasters eg many people run like hell to avoid death .. the history of the law was extremely not touching enough for me. <br /> <br /> But hey ... there's one thing we should appreciate about this movie though .... & it's got great songs!
