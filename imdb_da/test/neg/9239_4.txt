(The beginning may be a spoiler ...) <br /> "The Eye 2" is the sequel to "The Eye". It is a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident that has happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects scared hell out of me, but at the moment, but that's the only scary thing. Some of the prequel scenes are relatively uniform and repeated so the cooling effects have certainly cooled. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a rather scary and indelible impression, while "The Eye 2" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama movie. Don't see this. Seeing "The Eye" is good enough.
