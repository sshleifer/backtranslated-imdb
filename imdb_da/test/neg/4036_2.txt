I had the horrible accident of having to see this "b-movie" on the whole. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is --- save your time and money !!! This must be the worst b-movie all the time, not even called a b-movie, more like a f-movie! Because it fails in every aspect that makes a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all the actors are paper thin and not at all credible, it has poor direction and the action sequences are so fake, it's almost fun .. ..... almost . <br /> <br /> The movie is just packed full of crappy one-liners that no respectable person could find entertaining at least. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be aimed at men, but all women in it are so completely uninteresting, especially the old wrinkled stuff that comes into the end. They are trying to get sexy in the weird, terrible costumes and they fail otherwise! Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still make you laugh, but it is just too painful to watch !!
