I'm not a Jane Austen purist, but why make a movie like this if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong for the part it's hard to know where to start - wrong personality, modern make-up, totally wrong hair (there's no way a young lady in her age would have turned around in public with her hair loose and unburdened like that), she did not seem particularly depressed or pressed by the family and I did not understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind. <br /> <br /> The picnic (replaced the ball) was so low budget that it was embarrassing to see and miss the Portsmouth section completely ruined the point of the play (as well as losing scenes that could have added a gritty counterpoint to it oh -so-claustrophobic pink living room.) <br /> <br /> To those responsible: -If you don't have the imagination (though the budget doesn't matter as much as your imagination) to make something meaningful with an adaptation, don't let it seem like if you are it was about 10% Mansfield Park and 90% not at all <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
