With a cheap pound shop just opened, I thought it was worth seeing if their were any cheap DVDs that looked great. And while the back cover made this sound like a Jeepers Creepers type movie, it's actually an anthology movie! and thought that one or two of the stories felt very confidential. It's still a fun light scarecrow / comedy. The reasons: <br /> <br /> History one: The classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feels it's time to try to prove their financial life by picking up a $ 1500 car. But when the guy chooses a car, a car starts talking to him. The car (called Banns) says that in order to get everything he ever wanted in life, he has to buy Bans for $ 5000. So while guys relationship crumbles, Baan does everything he can to show who really is responsible. History two: Kitchen culture. A guy who can be thrown out of his landlord Because of how messy his apartment is, he discovers that, because of keeping the tuna paste in the fridge for six months, it has now cast and evolved into a green moldy version of itself! And as they start out as friends, they will end up having a big fall out, leading to a final blow to see if the real guy or his cooling clone survives. <br /> <br /> History three: Too good to be true. <br /> <br /> A girl meets a dating agency and she is matched as the guy is perfect for her. But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect, and when she thinks she sees him "shut", she starts to be spooked. Watch the movie: <br /> <br /> The first thing I must mention is the rating for the film in England, where it has received an eighteen rating, even thought it doesn't have nudity, swearing or blood at all. And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings where the goodies win! And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the movie, with director Tom Parkinson making the sense of history feel like a low-budget Muppet's episode! <br /> <br /> Final view on the movie <br /> <br /> Although it has a bit of a 'converted; Feel, their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'.
