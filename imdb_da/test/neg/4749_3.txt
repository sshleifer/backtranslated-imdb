I was only fourteen when I first saw the Alien movies, and I immediately liked it. Original, scary and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female character and would have earned a statuette for her action. In 1979, something eternally born, than the immortal series continued with no less legendary film than the first. Alien3 was another point of view, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, it was my favorite. Unfortunately, the last one was a mistake in many ways. It was strained, illogical, full of meaningless massacres. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought there would be a worse part in the future. Well as it turned out in 2004 I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad break and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should never have been done at all. But when I saw Alien vs. Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked by the way. When I sat down and decided to see it in full doubt, I never even thought that such a bad movie could be made. Without a play without an instructor and without actors, I do not understand how a movie can be made. Because this movie misses these three expressions. What you get is a good massacre show without a story, but with many annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time. This movie is rather impudence than the honor of fans of both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
