So just Coronado ... Here's the only line they came to sell it, "from the FX team behind the Independence Day". I think it says a lot. Don't talk about writers, directors, actors ... It's a cute little fairy tale story in a banana republic in Central America, but the story is thin. <br /> <br /> All of the movie, I thought how much this movie looks like the shots of some action computer war games. Although the FXs are good, they are all too often visible. Much like the cut scenes in CG's style as Command'n'Conquer. You know almost immediately that the particular truck, background, bridge, castle or jetfighter never existed. The look is smooth and beautiful, but not up to the standard we have expected from Action Adventures today. The film lacks a lot of obvious movie footage on the spot. <br /> <br /> The actor, storylin is below average, and the FXs are fine but not up to the film standard. I'm not surprised this thing went straight to the video / DVD. <br /> <br />
