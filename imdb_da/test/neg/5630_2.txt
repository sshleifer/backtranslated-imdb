RIDDEN was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what seems to be an attempt to draw Charles Dickens 'novels' mysteries into a contemporary story, but this attempt is counteracted by choosing to use the two periods of time format where "riddle" is unraveled. Despite a draft by well-known actors who do their best to draw this directly to DVD movies, the end product is a long boring, amateurish mess that can only be considered entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast who remembered from other movies . <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist limited to reporting on dog events while dreaming of important reporting tasks. A number of similar murders happen to include an old friend of Mike's - Sadie (Vera Day), who runs a pub on the banks of the River Thames, just after discovering an old valuable unknown manuscript by Charles Dickens and having a heart of gold which gives sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts mike to detective journalism and with the help of policeman Kate (Julie Cox) he begins to tie the investigation to tracks he finds by reading the Dickens manuscript. Disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks for Dickens' time when Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) tells a rather personal story of peculiar murder. The parallel between stories and cross-molding among actors may have worked in the hands of others, but the finesse of this kind of venture escapes author / director Brendan Foley. He finally draws his story (finally) with a tired Hollywood end. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the movie somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but fortunately distracting. This is a slender piece of treacle leaving the viewer and wondering how movies of this quality ever find financing. Grady Harp
