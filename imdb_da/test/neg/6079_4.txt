Amazing piece of fiction played as if actually. Tonight I look at Alcatraz Birdman. Robert Stoud was not a model bad prisoner and he was in jail because he was pimping and a customer couldn't pay up. When he entered the prison he was so uncontrollable that he spent most of his time in isolation or in the prison hospital. Also killed a few prisoners. This movie reminds me of Birdman of Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and he contributed to the community in someway. And the BOA had some hints about Stroud's lunacy. BUT this guy Henry Young, whom Murder in First is supposed to be about, was a well-known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more than one robbery. He was not a poor guy who stumbled into a merchant who just happened to be a post office and took some money. This man was a hard core criminal. He also killed a person 3 years before going to Alcatraz. He did not kill another person in prison because of the solitary confinement that ended over a year before the murder. The real story of his life would have been more interesting. They didn't even get things right. You cannot be cherished in 3 different prisons at the same time. And with all the accounts, the manager in the film was a beautiful ascender when the guards went. Plus, if my math is right, Warden, played by Karl Malden in BOA, is supposed to be the same guardian in this movie. Oh boy. Not only that, in this movie, we have to believe that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. Not true .. it can be alive right now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison, and then Walla Walla for another murder he committed and then released and jumped parole in 1972, never to be found. Maybe he's hanging out with the CB Cooper guy who jumped out of the Washington State airplane after committing a bank robber lol. Now the actor was very good. Kevin Bacon is in this class of actors, which includes Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the very underrated actors club. Gary oldman well, they could just make up the warden section so he could play it because he was fantastic. Christian Slater still sounds somehow like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. Bacon's wife Kyra Sedgwick was in the movie, I just think she is his wife. I like her myself, but not in this flick. For some reason I felt this movie when it first came out should be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel he could take someone who is really the victim of the criminal system, there are probably enough of them and scattered some light on their situation. Secondly, a psychopath chooses to act as a victim.
