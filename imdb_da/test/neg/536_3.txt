This movie stinks great. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi-charming. It is total disregard for a plot, and the lack of even insignificant surface character development made it seem like a lot of nice drawings. This is by far the worse anime that came out of Japan. I can't believe they actually put their names on this waste. What a rip off selling this stuff for $ 20. If you haven't seen this not bother. If you do, I apologize to you.
