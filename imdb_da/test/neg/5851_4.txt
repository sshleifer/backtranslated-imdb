In the advertisements for RAT RACE, it became so young that I could enjoy it, but since my girlfriend loves this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally hit it and saw it with him tonight. I get him to watch David Lynch movies and all kinds of obscure indie stuff (I recently forced URBANIA on him) so I felt I owed him an innocent Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't hurt his feelings so I saved my bitch for y'alls. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but a great deal annoyed me. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie", so I was a little surprised to find that the first scene centered around a porn movie. (I can hear it now: "Mommy, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no purpose in this movie, except to slow down some discomfort in a PG-13 movie. And while we're still on the segments of the casino, it's pretty handy that all the characters came to play within the same time frame, the slots that held the gold coins. What would have happened if they didn't? Would the millionaire gamblers just sit and wait? And how did they get these gold coins in slots in the first place? <br /> <br /> But I make a plot point needed for the movie to exist so I press. About Whoopi and her lost daughter: They meet for the first time, but throughout their trial they do not discuss anything about themselves with each other. Why does their relationship make such a presumption complicated? Couldn't they have been, says a mother and daughter on vacation together? Why does the company relate to a long time since adoption? And why does the daughter portray a hard driving career as a woman chained to her mobile phone, which never again needs contact with her business? Has the manuscript just forgotten this subplot and trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the greatest weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; It is exhausting when everyone is as much and without identical traits. And another thing - the events are not plausible. Oh, of course, the characters can do some nice things, but the characters themselves must be credible. Take the NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example. Frank Drebin has some rather exaggerated moments, but all he does is theoretically possible in his world. (Jane is also fun, but it's another kind of fun, which makes all the difference.) A character in the RAT RACE that challenges nature law by jumping on a speed drive destroys any plausibility that the movie may have; These are clearly not real people, so why should I worry about them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral. The signs achieve their modes of transport almost entirely by theft. I know, it's just a silly comedy, and the same actions did not disturb me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there are many offenses in the RAT RACE and it bothers me now. And I will not dive into the entire airport sabotage sequence except to wonder if the writers did not consider the reality of such action; was the scene fun before 9/11? I will skip the tantalizing bits of the heart, the work of one's family and the Nazis (whose structure and payout worked better in an episode of "Seinfeld") and continue to complain about the actor. Rowan Atkinson started off annoyingly and ended insufficiently; I don't know when I liked a comic character less. And the three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoopi came out best, but she didn't have much to work with (beloved copper perm and purple lipstick herself); Kathy Bates' part was sharp but mercifully short; Cuba, was ... Oh, man. Cuba, baby, please fire your agent! After INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is your third strike (please, I haven't seen PEARL HARBOR or SNOW HONDS) - it's time to give your 97 best supporting actress Oscar back to his rightful owner (Edward Norton for PRIMAL FEAR ). An actor of your stature has no outlets that run half-deserted through the desert and are checked out by a transvestite Lucille Ball impersonator. Do you read the scripts for your movies yourself anymore or do you get into a bag and pull out your next project randomly? <br /> <br /> There are other little points that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker loot so fast?) but in reality, RAT RACE is a little more than your basic series of character types are prevented by arbitrary obstacles on the way to a rather overwhelming and inexplicable ending. They give the money to charity? What kind of ending is it?!? Yes, it's the "noble" thing to do. Don't forget the likelihood of cross-promotion / licensing heads Smash Mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) Making a performance concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who will honestly do such a thing? Yes, they say it is the journey, not the destination, it makes a trip worthwhile, but there is no travel without a destination. If there ever was an example of a "wrong ending", it would be. What a bummer ends up in a movie that, despite my nitpicking here, I have enjoyed parts of (I confess to enjoy a little with the cow and some of Lucy stuff along with the character of the tongue piercing - first I thought his indelible speech would lead me wall, but he grew to my favorite). <br /> <br /> But as far as my boyfriend knows, I found the RAT RACE quite fun and charming. <br /> <br />
