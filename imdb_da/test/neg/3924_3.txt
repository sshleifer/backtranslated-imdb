There is nothing special or interesting about this run of the mill low budget sci-fi flick. Regardless of his pedigree origins (the movie is loosely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), this movie's plot and overall themes are by no means remarkable or original, science is weak at best, and the film unfortunately doesn't even involve compelling action sequences. The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and although the main plot does not really roll to the ship landing, most of the most interesting scenes appear along the way. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary traveler touches, their formerly interesting interpersonal relationships, speculation about cosmology and the meaning of life, and all that is interesting about the film, is too much for a single, far-flung plot of martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not very convincing webs or deceit. <br /> <br /> Also, there is nothing remarkable about the film's production quality either. That is acceptable. And most of the play, though slow, is okay. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a nice character. I guess the best quality of this movie, from my perspective is its fashion sense. The Martians have very good clothes! If this movie had a point, it could have been much more interesting. Oh good.
