This is another Alien imitation and not very good. Then, the outer space with the South African desert, throwing into the same ingredients, a group of people stretching in an inhospitable landscape, getting them hunted by a strange creature, and you have the same old story of a very ordinary movie, trying to monkey a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists are looking for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert cut off by the flesh. Their vehicle breaks down and they are looking for civilization while being stalked by the monster. The African location is pretty enough, but basically, this whole movie has gone after it. There is a vain attempt to build the excitement, but I found it not really worked and made the movie quite boring. The creature did not seem much, and when it did, it did not really install a sense of horror. There is a scene where someone gets the meat ripped off his arm, but it was basically that on the gorefront. In summary, I found this movie as exciting as watching paint dry. I give this movie 4/10, and it's only because of the interesting location that alone is not enough to save this movie from being a total snooze party
