The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German expressionism style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman who was dissatisfied with her culture, trying everything else and then going back to her roots. Here she again finds a great dissatisfaction, and finally it goes to the point of letting everyone else in her country find out the situation and what they will do now, since she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us feeling that this woman does not have loyalty. Mind you, she's torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background, it seems to find out what's important and right. She listens to so many voices and will probably end up with a world citizen of some kind than one with no links to her native Iranian culture. The only thing I received from this movie was fear.
