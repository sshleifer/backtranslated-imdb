I know my summary sounds very hard, but this movie has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time sticking to this movie. The whole movie consists of animated loggers who do their job and dance on floating logs. This is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the movie can be great to show to patrons in an art museum. But unless you really love this kind of art or are a Canadian who loves movies about your home country, it will probably be almost impossible to finish. I have a fairly high tolerance for this kind of thing, and even I had to force myself to look after a few minutes. I can respect the work that went into it, but it's just not convincing.
