Does Ocean's Twelve compare to the 2001 Oceans Eleven, so did others on all the things that remained the same? <br /> <br /> - All the stars returned to Twelve, and Zeta-Jones was added <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same manufacturers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same production designer; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same music director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed things other than changed when the "Oceans" franchise was established? <br /> <br /> - Twelve budgets were $ 25 million (30%) larger; <br /> <br /> - Eleven received good reviews, but Twelve were largely panned; <br /> <br /> - Eleven made $ 450 million, but Twelve dropped to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - Twelve home office fell 32%; <br /> <br /> - Soderbergh was with another scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> Film is a director's medium, of course. I almost forgot.
