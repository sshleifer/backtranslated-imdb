This movie is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I do not refer to the play, but rather the premise of both films, which attempt to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic characters. In addition, when it is highly respected, it disturbs me, honorable actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles because their status tends to give credibility to the director's intention to raise the subject of the film, a social exhaust. <br /> <br /> I was in junior high school in the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were much in the news. I remember the reason why the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Get hold of the people. Read the story. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He was driving around the LA streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside the tube to make a traffic jam; then abducted and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience, and many victims say they prefer death to their horror and humiliation. Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it just took a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here.
