and completely non-scary movies. The characters are not interested at all, and most of the time is spent in a car. The dog is at best ugly, never really scary. Interestingly, a more threatening threat would be necessary, at least a few people you care about and evoke some emotion in you. And not least, something interesting should happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this movie just pulls on and in, what works as always. Perhaps a Saint Bernhard was not as smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and society? In most scary movies / thrillers / mystery, whatever genre, there must be signs that spark the interest and make you want to know what's happening. Here you really don't care, you just wait for it to stop and wonder if it wouldn't be better to see something else. One of the weakest King adaptations.
