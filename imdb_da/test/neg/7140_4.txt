In Pasadena, Mrs Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to return her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire. After their meeting, Karen and Aubrey decide to investigate what happened to her and get cursed in the same situation and be chased by the ghost in the house. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the three high school fellows Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to his boyfriend Bill's (Christopher Cousins) apartment, which lives with his children, the teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and the boy Jake (Matthew Knight). On the next door strange things arise with their neighbor. "Grudge 2" has scary sound and visual effects with the scary woman and boy, and I've shot a few times while watching this movie. But the complex manuscript with three subplots is completely confused, making the interlaced history a complete mess. There are too many signs and situations, and at a certain moment I was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented story. Eventually, I was totally disappointed with this confused, but also spooky, movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("The Scream 2")
