This "movie" and I say it lightly is nothing but a clean trash can. I'm sorry for the people who actually wasted their money to see this in theaters. I saw a screener of the movie from a friend, and I have regretted it ever since. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I am extremely embarrassed to have seen this. Incidentally, I am extremely appalled that people from other races may have seen this as well and may think it is behavior in black people in general. It's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and sexes, terribly vulgar rough jokes and lame one-liners blew out of some well-known African American comedians who should have known better after reading this script! I also have to mention the many rap and hip hop singers / rappers who unfold the movie as if it were a lengthy music video --- they had absolutely no place in the movie. I suppose they were "Jiving & Singing Minstrels?" TERRIBLE. <br /> <br /> "The writers" producers and the one who had the stupidity to fund this "movie" should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to look at this crooked nonstop for the rest of their life. DO-NOT-WATCH-THIS-MOVIE !!! It's time wasted out of your life that you can never come back.
