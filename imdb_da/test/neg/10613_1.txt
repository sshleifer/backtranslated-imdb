Young writers, young writer, young cast, busload of manufacturers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description that suggests that three out of four legs worked, since actually none of them were. Hardly reused plotline for a 48 and a half minute tv, stretching stretched for ninety minutes. The audience spoke back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence. How many thousands of times has this been done on TV? Bad police are hitting good police. Again, how many times? There was no original shred throughout this collection. Giovanni Ribisi made a hard effort to defend the lack of manuscripts and draw the only laugh of the whole movie. And the idea of ​​him and Claire Danes, who work from a genuine script with an adult director and photographed by an actual film photographer, intrigues me. Note for scriptwriters: Buy one of these story generators. It may not be as bad as ripping off bath tv. Note for auteur: There are pictures available for you other than close-ups. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually becomes boring in close-up. Note for film photographer: Apprentice himself to a professional for a few years - you have a lot to learn. Note the color timer in the lab: at least try to persuade the autograph and the filmmaker that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this is paid for your new condo. It's time to get a professional management and start reading the scripts before they sign in.
