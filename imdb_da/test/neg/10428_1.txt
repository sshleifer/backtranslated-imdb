Journalist Bob Woodwards blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspicious actor John Belly's rise and fall becomes a completely misjudged movie, an unpleasant "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he was doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "The Shield") is set in the inevitable position to portray Belushi, take a post-mortem tour through his life and recreate these "Saturday Night Live" sketches which are now part of television the story. It's like seeing someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball - it can't be done. The reason there was such grief in Belushi's death was that he was one of a kind. Chiklis makes a wonderful attempt to see that part and he is fun in an early stage trying to escape from the morning house. Still, it's an upward venture, and no actor - no matter how talented - could have saved it. * from ****
