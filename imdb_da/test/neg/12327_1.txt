Audrey, I know you really appreciate your husband's Ted's memory, but do his legacy justice and pay attention to his desires. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We ask you to stop redeeming his stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They get disemboweled by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children get stuck in these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that forever pollute the warmth and innocence of the merciful. <br /> <br /> It's actually your property to do with whatever you want. I just wished you would listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what's left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
