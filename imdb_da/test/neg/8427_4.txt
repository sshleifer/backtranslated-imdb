I sat last night watching this movie being played on Greek television because of the upcoming Olympic Games that host my city. Knowing that it is an American movie, I had already expected to focus more on American athletics history. And I was really ready for it. But what I saw was ... too much! I believe that when a movie has such a title ("First Olympic Games: Athens 1896"), although it is of American origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and at the same time ignorant of other countries athletes and bets. The American athletes seem to have all the gifts in nature (strength, smartness, generosity, kindness, courtesy ...) as opposed to their "sin athletes" in Games who seem to be incapable of even ... speak their thoughts or express feelings. The number of times the American anthem is played during the film must be a full time record in filmography. It even uses fictitious facts that ridicule the Greek nation, as Greek nationals, who serve foreign marathon athletes with wine to help the domestic wins the race. So much for the Olympic spirit. Think about it. And putting a bad mark on a movie whose title is also Greek is something that doesn't make me happy according to what I've seen, I can't give it more than 4 out of 10 (be pretty generous actually).
