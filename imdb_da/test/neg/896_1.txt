Sometimes it is fun to watch movies implode from your sofa, but other times it is just terribly painful for both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the last minute is one of the rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind ask you to turn off the movie. This final pass to the House Party series is by far the worst, not just sequel, but Hollywood movie release. It becomes very clear early in this "feature" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes did not have trouble lifting Bueller's originality out of John Hughes' hands and choosing to make a movie, completely out of humor. You would think that by stealing themes and pictures from a more fun movie, your own movie would at least generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4, Stokes showed he doesn't have what it takes to lead a sequel, much less a Hollywood movie. From its confusing and choppy story, the inability to sense its characters and reused old / tired clich√© moments that all Stokes do is hitting a larger nail in the coffin that holds the House Party films. It reminds me of the student who forgets his project in an hour and quickly merges super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and straw and presents it as "Hannibal Crossing the Alps". It just looks terrible and you feel embarrassed to the creator. <br /> <br /> So where did this movie first jump into the line of comic stupidity? Honestly, I don't think most places will allow me to talk so long, so I would rather turn on some of the bigger issues that hit me the hardest. To begin with, I still can't shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed to lead another successor to the House Party and decided to introduce a completely random formula (from a funny movie) to see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into this formula. It was a big mistake. When an instructor tries to do this, it is ultimately confusing in the audience. We think we are moving in one direction, but instead we are in another. That's exactly what you can witness in House Party 4. In one case, we have John-John trying to get the biggest party of the decade while trying to score a record deal (ok, it reminds me of the original House Party), but then we whip away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid to fly, grandma gets full and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer. Again we start something strong and end up chaotic. This is the confusion I am talking about. Director Stokes did not have the ability to hold his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that audiences are idiots than attempts to revive a stony death series. One would think that when a director was entrusted with the task of filming another House Party movie, he would go into it and thought he would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, but instead wanted Stokes to be paid. <br /> <br /> I realize I'm slowly getting older as the days go by, but I still think I'm still holding my hand to the younger generation's culture. I listened to the rap and R&B is growing up, but the "immature" group has never made it to my cassette or my CD player. Why? I don't think they ever had the following, but apparently to director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to throw them as leaders in his new House Party movie. Has nobody at a studio realized that it would be red rather fast? Or what about the ability to have Stokes himself play the comic car repair, nothing like an instructor with no sense of comic timing throws himself as the only source of possible humor. It was one of the few cases where I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I'd find myself telling any movie. Outside of a place where there was no place that played the lead, I also thought that the rest of the players just kept sucking out of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ?? well ?? everyone else really falls into that category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes cost most of this movie? Not for special guest stars, because even though this movie may have boasted something, there was absolutely no present at the "unforgettable" house party or the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make a final look. House Party 4 did not follow a preset design, which ultimately destroyed this feature from the foundation down. Can anyone explain why there was a need to use the "escaped killer who happened to be an authorized taxi driver" routine of humor? Stokes reached deep into the bottom of the barrel and produced only more muck instead of fabric. For once, I can admit that there is no redeeming value for this movie. House Party 4 buried the series, and while I hear there may be more in the tube, I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series is dead. Hollywood has to let this series end, forget the past and move forward in the future. I believe a successor to who is the man? would get them started in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Degree: * out of *****
