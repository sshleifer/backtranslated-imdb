'Carolina Moon' is a suitable television movie about a girl with psychic powers returning to the city where she grew up in and where her childhood's best friend was murdered. Turns out that every year on the same day another girl is murdered, and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, has to solve the mystery before she ends up dying. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female leader and does a pretty good job on it, backed by the pretty delicious Oliver Hudsom and an ever-shining Jacqueline Bisset. The script, adapted from a Nora Roberts novel, is book standard, and the plot <br /> <br /> is dull predictable. However, it is offset again by, as I said, the rather delicious Oliver Hudson.
