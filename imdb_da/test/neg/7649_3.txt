I do not consider myself a conservative, so I was not personally offended by this film, but it was quite clear that the plot and characterization of this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - either good, freedom-conscious Americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. There is nothing wise or creative, just anti-conservative. I do not mind the political bias itself, but it should not be the sole purpose of the film. And that's clear. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the casting is wonderful and Chris Cooper's impression of W is fun the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke being told and then again. <br /> <br /> So if you really hate the conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a less black-and-white story, you'd rather see something else .
