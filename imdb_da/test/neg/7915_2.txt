Lifeless, second-rate animation, confused and un-funny songs (though the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of Tim Curry) and a weaker plot than Land Before Time 99: Fossils On Parade. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I haven't seen the first movie. I'm not a big fan of movies involving the sky or dogs, especially not in combination.

For a 'heaven' flick was the only good thing in this devil. 10.2.
