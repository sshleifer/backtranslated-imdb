There is no "fun" poking fun in the desperate situation of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of head shop owners, for that matter! That the richer than God Brian Glazer did not see the irony of having the "heroes" does exactly what the villain does - ass honest, hard-working people of their life savings - don't surprise me! Hell, how do you think he should be richer than God? In these alleged greed satirs, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: McMansions, McToys, McChildren, McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of McMansions, McToys and McChildren! But the main problem (except the outrageous bigotry) is the prerequisite: As the former head of a now infamous company, Dick would be the big scum for all the company's headhunter in the country! No soup kitchens for him! And raking in tall six characters, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a Gore / Lieberman poster!
