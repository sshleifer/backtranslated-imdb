This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. They said this was man's answer to waiting to exhale. All I have to say is that we really didn't react at all. I couldn't believe it was actually made. The director should choose another profession because he can't make a movie. Scripture was not good. It had no meaning and was very messy. Gameplay is much better than it was, and I was very disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this bad excuse for a movie. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't go back to Media Play to never buy the movie, I just wanted to keep it wrapped up on the shelf, instead of wasting my time watching it.
