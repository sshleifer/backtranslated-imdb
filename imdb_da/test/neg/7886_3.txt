I first saw a poster that advertised this film on a street in Helsinki in Finland in June 2000. What was my attention was that the proud proclamation advised all readers that even though it was French, the film had been "Banned in France ". When I got home to New York, I discovered that one of the "The Art House" biographers in the city screened the movie, and then (with my Finnish fiance) decided to see what it was all about. Boy, we ever did. <br /> <br /> Read the comments here and the reviews I knew were the movie violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, I went open-minded to see what had disturbed the senses of our Gallic cousins. Presumably, as anyone who reads this will know, the story involves two women embarking on a crime and killing in France (the film has English subtitles). However, the similarity with "Thelma and Louise" ends with it; the meat is unusually graphic (and in abundant supply) like the violence (a lot of stomping to death, and much blood and other organic matter splattering after spherical influences). <br /> <br /> At an intellectual level, the very essence of the movie is the relationship between gender and violence (manifested by the only sex these women know: one is a little-time prostitute and the other has made money from time to time by performing pornographic films, when, during their crimes and murders, they overcome their sexual situations, they only respond to the same violence and brutality they know and understand themselves. However, it is important to note that the victims of their rage are not only scary men interested in crazy sex (as there are more) but innocent passers-by, a woman at a cash machine, for example too. <br /> <br /> I understand not really why the repeated "porn movie" shots were all that was necessary (except to portray the physical contact as cruel, unwieldy and worn), and the relentless gore became rather boring after the first couple of violent spasm It is a rough and raw film, but in fairness it is about rough and raw people and just as unpleasant circumstances. From a point of view, the life of the French subclasses is examined, and it is quite ugly; A travel suggestion to France is certainly not - perhaps that is why the French have banned it. <br /> <br />
