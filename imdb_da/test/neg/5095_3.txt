This was one of the most boring movies I've seen for some time. I am in my late 40s and saw it together with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We looked around for an hour and turned it off. I spent more time on my iphone during the hour we saw it than I actually used to watch the movie. I gave it a 3 because I enjoyed the scenery and the movies; otherwise I would have given it a 1. I'm sure there are people who really are in "art" of everything that will find my review awful, but we all have the right to our own opinions, right? I couldn't figure out if this was to be a "chick flick", where the focus was on the mother, or if it was to be a movie for guys focusing on combat and adventure. In my opinion, they did not succeed either.
