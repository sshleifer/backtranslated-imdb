The author of "Prince" manages to take an excellent cast, a decent story, a mediocre script and carefully assemble them into a dull, monotonous, amateurish mess. In spite of a strong central performance by Frank Nasso, the Prince, this uncompromising film travels effortlessly from stage to scene, which painfully dissolves in hashish. The result gives a sigh of relief at the end where the joy years must be. A boring waste of time and talent and a good example of how NOT to control a movie. <br /> <br />
