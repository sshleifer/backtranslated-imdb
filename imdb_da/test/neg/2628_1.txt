Milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 turtle flick Mikey, if you actually check it up both movies have the same tagline! But if you want to see an incredibly fun movie with absolutely no plot at all ...... well then this is the movie for you. The action is horrible, and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story behind this cruelty is simple. Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortionist holding an unborn feoutus in a jar (NICE!) And was desperate for a child of his own, he counted on a way to bring one of these killed children to life and he called him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad actions, terrible governance, annoying sound of Milo's voice and the pervading sound of the bell on his bike, if you remove all that, it's still a bad but fun attempt a movie. I give it a bank busting 1 out of 10
