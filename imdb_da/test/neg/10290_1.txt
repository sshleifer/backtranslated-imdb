I'm not sure who recommended Monitoring to me, but I think I have an idea: One of "Fat Guys At the Movies." The person said they were amazed at how big it was and said it was one of the most scary / disturbing movies. (I paraphrase and do it only by memory, so forgive me if I dislike it.) At least I decided to see it. So I blame myself for my own miscalculation by watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strangely, I doubt I've ever called a movie "stupid," but that was the first word that came to mind about a third in and kept in my mind to the end. Where to start? Incredible prizes and responses, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or I just blame both) and tremendously bad plays. I think soon that Bill Pullman is the US President than an FBI agent here. (Of course there is a reason for that, and I will partly go into it.) And to top it off, if you can't find the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theater or to enter the room to see it late. Don't worry, they tell you "twist" every five minutes thereafter. <br /> <br /> There have been some serial kills on it loose in the most depressing city in the county or world. But there's more to the story! Some stupid and corrupt police would like to blow out tires for their own entertainment. Could there be more? Oh yes, there is a family, maybe not, but there are four people, one boy, one girl and one adult couple. The girl says she sees things with far less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There must be more to this than what I mentioned! That's what makes a movie interesting! Adding so many subplots that may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, so I continue. We have goofy FBI agents who made me laugh. A couple of giggling druggies that are initially shocked by their dealer OD, but then resorts for robbery. A gok-tooting big-guy policeman who must have been put in for comic relief, always fighting an angry / suspicious policeman. And finally (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who not only called his achievements, barely writes it. None of these works. They are all told in various forms of presence or flashbacks, and believe me you will lose all sense of care after the first of many subplots begins. In addition, some of these signs are the most shocking reaction to everyone. I suppose I mainly refer to the police, but mostly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blink. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's hardly gory as the person who recommended it said it was unless his exposure is limited to Goosebump's stories. And what's the title? Monitoring? Oh, I get it; That's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just for movie interviews. Since it is so random, it may as well be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrible mess.
