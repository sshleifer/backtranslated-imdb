Not just because of the theme of the movie. Which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. No. <br /> <br /> I saw this as I knew I didn't like it. I HATE numerology. When a person begins to walk around patterns with numbers, I feel I need to let them go. My own brain starts to hurt in empathy. And fully aware of this is a movie, just about the subject I couldn't resist the urge to see it and maybe get a good laugh. But it wasn't fun. Just exactly the stupid kind of "Isn't it scary and yet incredibly cool?! I can do some crap 23!" dialogue I was afraid of. As soon as the son began to chime in, I knew that this movie is a turd, no matter what happens. But I almost never stop watching a movie I started. I sat through it. I enjoy the pain. <br /> <br /> The movie pretends to mock numerology during disguise to show how obsession can end badly. But it rides like wave as much as it should spoil it. I can't see the message. I see only signs that rage about a stupid number with little plot to justify. <br /> <br /> Top it with the usual "surprises" - trying to put another twist to throw you off, it makes no sense and you almost believe it because of the quality of the narrative until there - And you get a hollow piece of film making. It just happens to be centered on the subject I despise. If only it was not trying to be serious and had rather been a hilarious movie with actors, I am not giving anything amazing. But I started to like Carrey ... while it's not his fault, he's trying. It is not even good to see with a bunch of friends and mst3k hell out of it. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough for anyone to travel on them, but this movie managed to live up to being one of the worst I've ever seen.
