Anyone who saw "Alien vs. Predator" must have known that the "Alien Quadrilogy" conventions were not exactly matched to the movie. Among some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of foreigners appears to be a matter of minutes, foreigners with extremely long tails, and so on. However, the idea of ​​the Predator species, which gave the impetus to the city and temple building, was to hunt for warriors so appealing that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the end of the movie would not be the progress of this sequel, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who forgot how the first movie ended, the dead Predator had an Alien burst through his chest, carrying features of both species. "<br /> <br /> For this movie I will just go through a list of" good "and" bad "moves. <br /> <br /> The Good: Lots of beautiful people, especially the men. /> The bad: Lots of beautiful people are munched by both mutant Predator / Alien and Predator. <br /> <br /> The good: An interesting idea of ​​the Predator planet. <br /> <br /> The bad: An inconsistent scale of a city. It is a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewer system and homeless. Is it a small town or a city? or I counted. <br /> <br /> The good: Um .... The bad: Why do these mutant Aliens / Predators grow so fast? In five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. think what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And while we are on this topic, why is it that an Alien inside the Predator's body mutates, but an Alien in a human's body does not make it sensible? br /> <br /> The good: Still thinking ... The bad: Why would only one predator come? And why it pours over all the remnants of "aliens", but it decides to murder a sweet substitute and sees skin and hangs it upside down. I mean so much to be incognito! <br /> <br /> The good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I think there are lots of loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The bad: How do these mutated Alien / Predators produce? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss-type movement they deposit several offspring into the woman's body. Yes, just what you want to see, eh? Pregnant women who have their bodies explode in mutant aliens - as if the previous road wasn't rough enough !!!. I mean, there's not even an Alien Queen. <br /> <br /> The Good: Did I say the boys in this movie are beautiful? <br /> <br /> The bad: When an atomic device blows each other, how does a helicopter survive blast? And how sticky is it for one of the passengers to mock the pilot "I told you not to collide!" I mean, considering the nuclear spill when he wakes up in the morning, he has no hair! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get the message. Mutated Alien / Predator bursts through the dead Predator's body, grows in a few minutes, kills all the predators and manages to crash on the ground. Several mutant Alien / Predators are created, while the ONE measly Predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills people. Mutant Alien / Predators kill people. People kill people. Sick to be a man in this movie, eh? <br /> <br /> If you are impressed by lots of armor and bumps, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked it First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
