Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this horrible country song that tries comedy. They might as well call this show "Generic" because that's what it is. It's stupid and generic. Reba, you're not fun, and I'm glad your retarded show was canceled because you suck, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-haired teenager, the jockey guy and the 12 year old who was beaten. You all suck and none of you is funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil worshiper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals. And she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her "music" hoping to get children to kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst show ever, Reba is gay, I don't like her, I think Office is better than this show, and this show sucks.
