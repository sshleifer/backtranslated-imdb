Back to Sender, a.k.a. Convicted, is almost imperfect. The one good thing about this movie was that I never get bored. That said, the reviews that greet this movie as a low budget success may not have seen the same movie that I saw. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and telling what is happening and what works and doing it doesn't work, I just want to comment that nothing works. There are plot holes in this movie that you can run a semi through. The action in the movie is not very good, although it may be a result of a script so poorly formulated that it could have been the ghost written by George Lucas. There was no need for extra sets or costumes for this movie and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention that there were some plot holes? At the end of the movie you wonder how a blind guy can be so well shot with a shotgun, why Kelly Preston relies on Aidan Quinn why she would fall asleep the night before her client was to kill how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car holding down the rest of the movie, why Aidan Quinn wasn't with a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc. <br /> <br /> With all that said, this is definitely a B movie and a horrible one. The unfortunate thing is that it's just not bad enough to be good. If you appreciate your time, let it act as a public service message to stay away from it.
