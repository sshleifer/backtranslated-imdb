To preface my remarks on the movie, I know the subject is terrible, and words cannot adequately express the compassion that any decent person would have for people dealing with a nuclear bomb's record, fell near them. <br /> <br /> But this movie isn't really horrible except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the photos are horrible and should be a reminder of the destruction of nuclear weapons. When you see burned people walking around speechlessly or man fighting the hair and lumps of hair coming out, etc., this is not a good sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first twelve minutes, this Japanese movie concerns people dealing with the aftermath of Hiroshima in the mid-late 40s. In fact, I found the story of developing rapidly into a dull soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole story happens five years after the bomb and deals mainly with a family's problems at that time. That's why it became more of a melodrama than a shocking story of nuclear disaster. It is simply a story of how these people began with their lives from around 1950 on whether one of the women was permanently injured and in which case would she be married? <br /> <br /> This could have been a real movie, but it didn't go that way
