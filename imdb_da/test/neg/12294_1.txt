To call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement. The action was not convincing to say the least, especially from the actor Craig Fong who couldn't have acted stiffer. As far as the story goes ... Now ... what story? The "movie" is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malaysian Chinese descent who returns to his homeland after flipping out of every course he took and trying to start a band. <br /> <br /> The movie has ever been clich√© you can think of - sex, tensions among band members and a little racial excitement thrown in. The problem is that even with a subject that has been adequately covered by even the most amateur directors the film is everywhere, and all things just feel constructed with parts that would make even the most hardened proofreaders hair stand on the end. <br /> <br />
