"Death Machines" takes a pretty decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts kills sent out to eliminate a criminal's opponents) and makes it an unacceptable mess. I have rarely seen such a breathtaking combination of small budget, bad acting and incoherent script published as a so-called "movie". It's easily the worst martial arts / action-oriented movie I've seen this year, and even darkens the "Ninja Holocaust" (which at least had some good energetic combat scenes). The actual "star" in the movie is the white "Death Machine" (that's basically his vehicle), so he's highlighted prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He is in good shape and he does not look bad, but as an actor he is right there - think Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", only without energy or emotion. This is, of course, a deliberate choice from the actor and director. .. but you have to be Arnold to pull this kind of thing away, and this guy is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> The movie (and the director) cannot seem to find the time (or budget) to film scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally constituted as: Who was the shady figure who did the marmorous mouth give Asian lady her orders? How did the "gang war" end? Why did the mush-mouthed Asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? And what happened that left his assistant dead and her with a katana as a broom? <br /> <br /> It does, however, take time to film a very strange bar where a sailor (well, resembling Popeye) destroys a bar because the jukebox did not work. It is only related to the rest of the movie, because in KO he is also the movie's "hero", a bartender / karate student who was the victim of "Death Machines" the first major task (he got his hand carved by the killed his teacher ). It follows this with one of the most unchallenged "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend I've ever seen. Segue makes no sense - at the end of the bar she grimes over his splayed limp body, and the next thing they are in a "tasteful" shade of sex and love that resembles a Hallmark card. BTW, we never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see the showdown between the murder detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and the writer never saw a movie scene located within a police station but had heard of their used hand and decided to include some outside really knowing how they worked. <br /> <br /> The film is a textbook of poor casting and community theater-level actors floundering without decent direction. The three "dead machines" come across lumps; "The hero" knows his lines, but cannot bear the film, as his character is an ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other smaller parts are hardly visible. All this gives a pretty bad movie - but the "dragon lady" does more to pull the movie into underground stink territory than anyone or something else. She looks ridiculous; Her little, unpredictable face is overcome by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and she speaks with a horrible mush-mouth delivery that screams "necessary time with a dialogue coach". Poor lady - she was of course completely out of her element, and as far as I know, never came in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add this to a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never closes up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; crappy film storage and lighting; battle choreography that is strictly from hunger; and a general about turning and lack of energy in blocking and stage business ... and you have a lame movie. <br /> <br /> I got this as part of a 50 movie DVD compilation so it cost me about 50 cents to watch it. It was not worth it. Feh!
