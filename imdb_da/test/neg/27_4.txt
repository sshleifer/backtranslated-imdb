"Cover Girl" is a dark WWII musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it, except for its signature song, "Long Ago and Far Away." This movie came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic steps, and although there are signs of his exploding talent here, he mainly plays sidekick to Rita Hayworth. And that's the problem. Rita Hayworth is beautiful, no doubt about it. But she is simply not a convincing screen presence. I've always found myself wanting to like her more than I actually do, and this movie is no exception. She is simply not a very good actress, and she is not even a very good dancer. Good looks as she is, there is some rapidity about her, and this movie suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
