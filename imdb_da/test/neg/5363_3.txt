Although Ryan wasn't such an annoying person, it would still be bad, I said though, where do we start? "Director Log" You want to tear his tape recorder and pound it with a hammer or groove it in a lake, a haunted lake of course. Oh, how I want "dead time" was more literally contrary to what they refer to as, but unfortunately no death, perhaps a pillow out of place or a "humming noise" oh, wait, it's the cat. In fact, I expected to see some kind of evidence or at least something to verify their escapades, don't worry, you won't see anything you wouldn't see on a normal day. <br /> <br /> An entire season and what should they show it for nothing. Not really they have less than nothing they have wasted time. They took my challenge, doing something for the paranormal challenge. Now in this you actually do something for the paranormal, you can say go on camera and say "I love the paranormal so much, I want to draw ghosts of ghosts" or "I love paranormal so much, I want movies hot co-eds pretend to be ghost hunters "you would waste movies but waste it on the paranormal. Or you can say "I want to row with a demon", but don't say it's the name you can get hurt, and you know God doesn't like it, it would be a good thing for God, but he didn't like it so don't. So I asked them to waste time on paranormal and they followed, they went into an old building looking for "mothman", it was a waste of time, it made no real difference, it had no effect, we learned nothing new , it was a waste of time and movies. There is fantastic detective work just as scary, "well we found your problem" a cat died here, so should mentally communicate with that cat and tell it to move on, kind of throw some cat buds on it and it will be ok .... .. directors log .... "Captain log star date 541.2 ... Oh I mean" directors smiled, I just brought in a few new investigators are a couple 8 and 9, but this smart one 10 .... yes. .. we have a new case ... strange things happening .... ....... on one of the kids ..... should investigate. "Now we will bring is a psychic, we have not told them anything, it is TV, trust us,
