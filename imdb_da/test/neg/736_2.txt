I've seen some awful book-to-movie adjustments in my day, but this tops them all! The bizarre unattractive caste detracts from the story, which in itself is unlikely for the book. Sir. Tilney is not as beautiful; as for Catherine Morland, a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is not something that the aphrodite you read about in the original text, and James Morland appears in the movie too little to leave the viewer with some understanding of his important role in history. Also, as others have pointed out before, this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic craze widespread in Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft horror" movie is designed and intended to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns around in her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed with this horrible interpretation of what should be a joke.
