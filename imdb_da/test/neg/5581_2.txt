The kind of B-movie from the 1950s that was schlocky yet so much fun is what Predator Island pays homage to. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is set on an island called a Hell's Beacon lighthouse inhabited by only the couple who tend to the lighthouse. In typical 1950s sci-fi fashion after half a dozen young adults, their boat collides into the island's rocky shore horrible creatures from outer space invading the island after a meteor hits nearby. The creatures begin to inhabit their victims as well as they devour them. Lots of curse and lame comebacks are the primary form of dialogue in this movie. It's so hokey that you just have to laugh at times. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid, but in a fun way, this will fit the bill. <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: I appear in the film as a dead body in the extreme background of the final scene. During the film they needed about 50 extras, but approx. 300 people showed up for the opportunity. They eventually spent almost 200 of them.
