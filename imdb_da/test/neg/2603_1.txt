Everything about this show is terrible. Its premise sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing. A "dysfunctional family" theme has already been used too many times, especially by the Simpsons, which is a great show with large writing and many laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of history in every episode with lots of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in. Now, if it was original or fun, I would probably think it was wise. But no, it's not fun at all. In fact, the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly battle episode after the episode of this junk. Much of this show is unoriginal and what is original is just lame. It is also incredibly raw and irreverent, which in turn can be fine if it is still intelligent. Animation is not all, but from an artistic point of view, this show also fails and shows once again that Family Guy strives for as many cheap jokes and quick shortcuts as possible. People enjoy this show and I don't care about it because people can enjoy whatever they want, no matter how much they aim for the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend this, especially for anyone who wants to one day study movies or become an author. This is cheap entertainment that aims low and has been successful in this. That this is so successful says bad things about America.
