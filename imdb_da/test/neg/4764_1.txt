This film is about a group of people who are infected with a strong human-made virus. They are pursued by the government's men in the desert. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the film is quite interesting, but is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring. In no way does the movie interfere with the viewer at any level. Granted, the smallest budget is a problem, but that's not the reason for the film's failure. Much more fault is the very po-faced delivery. There is a great narrative, but unfortunately the narrator has an annoying overramatic voice. Very little seems to happen to these people, and well before the end you will rooting for government men - the sooner the main characters kill the faster the movie will end. A much better title for this movie would have been four people driving around in the desert with some movie footage of a helicopter. Overall very boring.
