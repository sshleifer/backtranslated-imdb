Being an inappropriate non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and absolutely incredible in every way. The pace is constantly fever-pitched, and all actions and actors are gripped by total hysteria. It is close to uneven, and a spot - one, a blemish - on the careers of everyone involved. The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go "Come on!" All the time. The setting and events are impossible to take seriously externally. I can only judge this abomination a 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> To see a good asteroid movie, see Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and intriguing. All Armageddon is not.
