The Master of Italian horror Dario Argento is called many bad things by non-fans. And deserve absolutely none of the backlash. In fact, every time I hear something bad about Argento, I think they really talk about Michele Soavi. He gets just as much attention because his films were never so successful in theaters. In fact, his best movie - 1994's Cemetery Man - was probably his least successful. Or just don't get the attention he felt it deserved, because after that he left movies and went into the television. He has never gone back. So people do not really know how inferior his other films are, because at the time they have seen them, they are already fans of the Italian horror aesthetics. Which means that you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and usually are very uninteresting movies. This is where the Church stands out from the package. Because visually, it's so cheap and antique look you can smell the dust. But it also has its charms, though few. The camera work is really arresting and the music score is very elaborate and great. When Argento is the reason people have seen Soavia's work, I don't know anyone who caught the Church before Argentos Suspiria and Deep Red. Soavi is a bit of a hack. Kind of like an Italian Mick Garris - the ultimate example of an instructor who prefers style over fabric. Church failures are constant and plentiful. The film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant town similar to the one you see in a Robin Hood adaptation in some past centuries. These scenes are intense enough, energetic, and quickly get to that point. Then we cut to the present where the film's style takes over. Yes, the movie is okay to look at. And for about 35 minutes in the present, the 1980s anywhere, Italy, the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing scare elements. So now we know that the purpose of the movie is the construction of it's horror. And it's a decent structure, for the most part. But when the film approaches the halfway point, we realize the movie's driving past, and ... nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The reason is very simple. I think. Two people working in a church, a cataloging book, and the other as a restorer of the building's wall text, discover a scroll / writing that the man believes will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or invaluable artifact that he can sell and get rich out. Then he only follows his card to uncover a power under the church that has him hallucinating while slowly becoming a demon who will make all other halluciners. So, while doing his demon work, killing a person passing the power in a way that everyone in the church kills while the demon "contagen" spreads on everyone, leaving a black preacher and the little girl sneaking out of church each night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls. It probably sounds action-packed, and Soavi's style is far more dull than Argento. But never before have I seen an attempt at surrealistic movies that are so boring boring. I'm not asking you. Absolutely nothing happens throughout the movie! I've seen Expressionist (or Impressionist, I'm no movie school super-grad) movie before, but most of them actually show things happening (John Carpenter's Halloween for one). It follows quite closely in the footsteps of Lamberto Bava's Demons movie (since Argento co-produced). We are shown to a place where a lot of people gather, one becomes a demon, all the others are isolated, that person infects all but a few survivors, as the demons either infect the world or the survivors get out when the demons die. This film puts all the same elements in place. Except, unlike Argento's work, nothing happens. Okay, a few things happen. But only a bizarre sequence has the panache of Lamberto's much more fun Demons movie. A random woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence, he scratches out of the floor. What is bizarre about it, you wonder? It happens in front of about two dozen people. What are they doing? Nothing. She dies, her head trickles blood in close-up. But all these people do not even notice, even though it is in plain view and not less than 8 meters away from them. Perhaps the 4 people notice the demon who runs up to throw someone he can when he runs towards her so they get out of the way. She is killed, and in the shot, after she dies, everyone just sits together and is quiet while a boy plays a saxophone. I'm not asking you. That's what happens. It's more than logically incoherent - it's simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene suggests that the woman just disappears and no one saw her death. They are all straight up and forget it. And this 15-second thing is definitely the only event taking place in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, gore or murder we see. It is not. It's only the only thing we can tell happens. For example, a beautiful woman in a scene sees herself in a mirror that looks old and ugly. She starts pawing the skin on her face, but when she comes back minutes later - no scratches. People are consumed by fish, and their faces are squashed by metropolitan vehicles. But later, they emerge as utterly inaudible members of an obsessed cult, in a scene committing the ultimate horror heresy - copying a famous scene from Roman Polanski's masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, the greatest horror movie ever made, shot to shots. Although Argento did, I would be furious!
