When you make a movie with a killer-kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; You can either make it as realistic as possible and create trustworthy characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it to fun (something that the creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" did, for example, on a just controversial topic: a killer santa). However, the people who made "Bloody Birthday" do none of these things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a child with a gun (or a knife or nose or arrow) in his hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole movie looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years). It is redeemed a little by good performances from the kids, but it is very worn out. (* 1/2)
