this cartoon is not real, i totally disagree with many things it portrayed, but it ended positively, but for me and mine we will not see this in our household, mainly because we are fighting against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel like black people seem like <br /> <br /> the comment one of the little black girls made on the comic was that her boyfriend was so conscious (he was white) who really offended me, it is not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being as black people achieve when they realize their true ability
